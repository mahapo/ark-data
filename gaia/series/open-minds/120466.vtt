background.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.380 align:middle line:90%
My mother is South African.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.650 align:middle line:90%
My father is Zimbabwean.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.330 align:middle line:90%
I was born and raised in the UK.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.610 align:middle line:84%
On my father's side,
which is Russian Jews,

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.610 align:middle line:90%
who went to Africa.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.940 align:middle line:84%
On my mother's side were
Africanas and English

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.350 align:middle line:84%
who went to Africa in
the late 17th century.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're very much part of
the problem of apartheid,

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.942 align:middle line:84%
but we're also people who
fought against apartheid,

00:04:45.942 --> 00:04:47.150 align:middle line:90%
and were in jail fighting it.

So I came from a very
politicized family,

00:04:48.858 --> 00:04:52.842 align:middle line:84%

of England, or what or what

>>ISAACSON: Yes.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.470 align:middle line:84%
The problem with the English
public school system,

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.950 align:middle line:84%
as we call it
there, is that it's

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.380 align:middle line:84%
a system that brutalizes
you mentally, first

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.630 align:middle line:90%
physically, and then mentally.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And the idea behind
it was that it

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.780 align:middle line:84%
was going to create
hundreds of thousands

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.450 align:middle line:84%
of young boys, who were
young men, who would go

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.000 align:middle line:90%
out and administer the empire.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you go back 100
years, go back 200 years,

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.770 align:middle line:84%
what England was up to then
was conquering the planet.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.660 align:middle line:84%
An awful lot of
manpower was needed

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.000 align:middle line:84%
to have these guys at
18, 21, et cetera, going

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:84%
to administer huge
areas of the Sudan

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.369 align:middle line:84%
with an absolute sort of
firm belief in the empire--

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Certainty, yes.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: --in themselves.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And most of them died of
malaria, and most of them

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.950 align:middle line:84%
were killed in native
skirmishes or whatever,

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.580 align:middle line:84%
and they had to sort of
just go into these things.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the same ethos that
took us over the top

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:90%
in the World War II trenches.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a good side to
it-- the courage, the grit.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.755 align:middle line:84%
When we were in World
War II, for example,

00:06:03.755 --> 00:06:06.046 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't have gotten
through the blitz without that.

00:06:06.046 --> 00:06:10.120 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of a way to go
through the modern world,

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.440 align:middle line:90%
it's redundant, really.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.445 align:middle line:84%
And so the problem was they told
us when we were little boys,

00:06:15.445 --> 00:06:17.320 align:middle line:84%
we're going to break
you down, and then we're

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.486 align:middle line:90%
going to build you up again.

00:06:18.486 --> 00:06:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And as we were
talking off camera,

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.090 align:middle line:84%
the problem with it
when you're a child

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.690 align:middle line:84%
is that you believe
what adults tell you.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And so the reality for
me-- and for anyone

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle line:84%
who went through the
system-- was what you first

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.110 align:middle line:84%
contended with before the
physical stuff happened here

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:42.210 align:middle line:84%
was this crushing, overwhelming
weight of adult sarcasm

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and hostility that you couldn't
understand what you'd done.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:46.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And brutality.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: Absolutely--
to engender.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
they beat you as well.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And then around about the
time you got to about 14,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and you started getting big,
they stopped beating you,

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and they start giving
you privileges.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.498 align:middle line:84%
Right about the
time when you might

00:06:59.498 --> 00:07:02.420 align:middle line:84%
start fighting
back properly, then

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.000 align:middle line:84%
you get the
privileges and so on.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's so
painful to even hear,

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.210 align:middle line:84%
and I know other British
public school boys.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:09.660 align:middle line:90%
It's very painful.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.035 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: The worst of it--
and it's even more corrupt,

00:07:12.035 --> 00:07:16.060 align:middle line:84%
really, in a way-- because
among the privileges

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.700 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to then
discipline and brutalize

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.070 align:middle line:90%
younger boys.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.630 align:middle line:84%
So to visit upon
the younger boys

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.830 align:middle line:90%
what's been visited upon you.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being faced
with that choice when

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.750 align:middle line:84%
I was about 14, 15 and
realizing that this

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.434 align:middle line:84%
was one of those absolute
parts, forks in life--

00:07:35.434 --> 00:07:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A defining moment.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: Yes,
that I could either

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.200 align:middle line:84%
be that problem that
I had been surviving,

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.540 align:middle line:90%
or I could choose not to be.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.831 align:middle line:84%
But if I chose not to be, I
would get no brownie points

00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:47.320 align:middle line:90%
from the institution.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.419 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't find
it in me to do it.

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:50.710 align:middle line:90%
I did not want to be a prefect.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.410 align:middle line:84%
I did not want any jurisdiction
over the younger boys,

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and I did not want to have
any part in their brutalizing.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And there were a lot of
people like me, obviously.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And thank god those
of us who made

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.540 align:middle line:84%
that choice made that choice,
because I think if you make

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.873 align:middle line:84%
the other choice, you then
have to spend the next 30, 40

00:08:08.873 --> 00:08:10.970 align:middle line:84%
years unlearning that
particular thing,

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.480 align:middle line:90%
and you're almost hamstrung.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.310 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like having
a leg chopped off.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.893 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's
so desensitizing.

00:08:14.893 --> 00:08:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Then you have to
try to re-salvage

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.810 align:middle line:84%
those parts of the soul,
so to speak, once again.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:19.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Exactly.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you then want to decent
family life or something

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.240 align:middle line:84%
like that, then it's
going to be tough.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this all
happened in the city of London.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: This happened in
the financial district, yeah.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:30.230 align:middle line:84%
The school I was at was a very
old school, one of those 500

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.190 align:middle line:84%
or 600-year-old schools
that had been started

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.659 align:middle line:84%
to produce boys to enter
the financial industry, even

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:39.780 align:middle line:84%
in the 15th century, by the
aldermen of the city of London.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.659 align:middle line:84%
City of London, if you're
an American viewer,

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.250 align:middle line:84%
what we call the city,
you guys call Wall Street.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And it actually
means the same thing.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.496 align:middle line:84%
Wall Street is Wall
Street, because it's

00:08:48.496 --> 00:08:51.800 align:middle line:84%
withinside the old
walled compound

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.260 align:middle line:84%
that the first Dutch
settlers put there

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.760 align:middle line:84%
as a fortress, Battery
Park to the wall.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's the square mile
of the old Roman fortress

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.790 align:middle line:84%
that became the medieval
financial district

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.570 align:middle line:84%
that the Romans first put there
on top of the Celtic settlement

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.420 align:middle line:84%
to make a bridgehead,
their fortress 2,000 years

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.590 align:middle line:90%
before that in the UK.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So the same process
of colonization--

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.126 align:middle line:84%
they were colonizing
from southern Europe

00:09:19.126 --> 00:09:20.500 align:middle line:84%
up into northern
Europe, and then

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.525 align:middle line:84%
the northern Europeans
colonized over to North America,

00:09:22.525 --> 00:09:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and you had all the Indians, all
the Celts, all the [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:84%
looking at them from
the forest going,

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.450 align:middle line:90%
hm, this looks like trouble.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.800 align:middle line:90%
And indeed, it was.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.500 align:middle line:84%
So there you are right
in the belly of at all,

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.020 align:middle line:84%
receiving what is considered
to be the world's most

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.340 align:middle line:90%
privileged education.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And we've already spoken to the
challenges of that, and that

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.900 align:middle line:84%
the redundancy of it
really in today's time.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And alongside this, you
also had an affinity

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:59.460 align:middle line:90%
for the equine world.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And you are a professional
horse trainer.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.930 align:middle line:90%
You're a horseman.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Talk a little bit about
how horses entered

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.420 align:middle line:84%
into the picture, because
this will figure large

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.320 align:middle line:90%
into this story.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: Well, my parents
are as open as can be.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Middle of London, school in
the middle of London-- horses

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:18.270 align:middle line:90%
were always my thing.

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.420 align:middle line:84%
But these things often skip
generations in families.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.941 align:middle line:84%
I come from a long line
of light cavalry officers,

00:10:24.941 --> 00:10:26.190 align:middle line:90%
particularly in South African.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Light cavalry.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: Light cavalry,
irregular cavalry,

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:33.040 align:middle line:84%
meaning the sort of special
forces type cavalry who

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.890 align:middle line:84%
would be skirmishes
on the-- there

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:38.140 align:middle line:84%
are many of my family had
their own regiments for this

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.190 align:middle line:90%
in South Africa.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.980 align:middle line:84%
During the Bull War, in fact,
four of my great-great-uncles

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.940 align:middle line:84%
had their own regiments
of light cavalry

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.590 align:middle line:90%
on different sides of the wall.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:47.120 align:middle line:90%
They fought on different sides.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.240 align:middle line:90%
It runs in the blood.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was fortunate in that
I had an aunt, also South

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.880 align:middle line:84%
African, who'd married into
the British fox hunting

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.219 align:middle line:84%
culture in Leicestershire,
which is the seat of that.

00:10:59.219 --> 00:11:01.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a connection
between Leicestershire

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and fox hunting and
the founding fathers,

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.870 align:middle line:90%
which you might want to go into.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:04.440 align:middle line:90%
It's quite interesting.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:04.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Just go ahead.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:05.445 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: Do you
want to digress?

00:11:05.445 --> 00:11:07.111 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
don't mind digressing.

00:11:07.111 --> 00:11:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: The
sport of fox hunting

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.890 align:middle line:84%
began in England
in the 18th century

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:13.830 align:middle line:84%
with the invention of
the thoroughbred horse

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.460 align:middle line:84%
and the addiction
to speed and hunting

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.640 align:middle line:84%
small game fast across
country jumping big fences.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.810 align:middle line:90%
Incredibly dangerous.

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:24.870 align:middle line:84%
The Duke of Wellington
called it the image of war

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.130 align:middle line:84%
without its guilt, and
only 25% of it's dangerous.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.242 align:middle line:84%
So 25% of the danger of a
pitched battle is quite a lot,

00:11:31.242 --> 00:11:32.700 align:middle line:84%
and certainly
growing up with this,

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.780 align:middle line:84%
I saw people killed
and maimed next to me.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.040 align:middle line:84%
So the action and the adrenalin
side of it is incredibly--

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You take risks.

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: But more
than say, snowboarding.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, around
that time, that

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:49.800 align:middle line:84%
was when the English gentlemen
who were going over to Virginia

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.520 align:middle line:84%
and founding those big estates
like Lord Fairfax and so on,

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and teaming up with
better families of that

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.570 align:middle line:84%
like the Washingtons,
et cetera-- they all

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.160 align:middle line:84%
had their own
packs of foxhounds,

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.400 align:middle line:84%
because it was what Jefferson,
Fairfax, George Washington had

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.600 align:middle line:90%
his own English foxhound.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.190 align:middle line:84%
So right when this
culture was coming

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:10.810 align:middle line:84%
to fruition in that
part of England

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.510 align:middle line:84%
where I was growing up,
in the mid-18th century,

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:16.122 align:middle line:84%
it was also having a
parallel beginning here.

00:12:16.122 --> 00:12:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost
like freemasonry.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.370 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of one of
these codes of gentlemen.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: Things
that people did,

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.620 align:middle line:90%
and it was a test of encourage.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And people wanted to
know who you hunted with,

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:27.220 align:middle line:84%
because if you hunted
here, it was fashionable,

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.410 align:middle line:90%
because it was more dangerous.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.326 align:middle line:84%
If you hunted there, it
wasn't as fashionable.

00:12:30.326 --> 00:12:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I have
to say I had the-- well,

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.580 align:middle line:84%
I was in a unique
situation one time, invited

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:38.370 align:middle line:84%
to a dinner party in Virginia,
an estate near Monticello,

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:39.950 align:middle line:90%
near Jefferson's estate.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't aware
until I arrived--

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.240 align:middle line:84%
I think I must have been
brought in as the entertainment

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.040 align:middle line:90%
for the group.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: You
came out of a cake.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
something like that.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:49.370 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:53.540 align:middle line:84%
I was actually an invited guest,
but multinationals corporation

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.560 align:middle line:84%
heads-- I won't name some
of the corporations-- hotels

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and so forth-- were at
the dinner party, which

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.557 align:middle line:84%
was made vegetarian in
my honor, because I had

00:13:01.557 --> 00:13:03.140 align:middle line:84%
a vegetarian cooking
show at the time,

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.600 align:middle line:84%
and the host just
happened to like me.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.200 align:middle line:84%
But I realized after
a minute or two,

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.850 align:middle line:84%
this was all about
fox hunting season.

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Yes.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.190 align:middle line:90%
Virginia is the capitol here.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I realized this
was how these people connected

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:17.050 align:middle line:90%
and gathered--

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: It's an
international world.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.991 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --same time each year,
and it was a global affair.

00:13:19.991 --> 00:13:22.448 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: The first job I
ever did when I came to America

00:13:22.448 --> 00:13:24.800 align:middle line:84%
was training horses in the
hunt field in Virginia.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.232 align:middle line:84%
So now you had this
passion for horses,

00:13:29.232 --> 00:13:30.690 align:middle line:84%
and that's how you
began it, right?

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: I did, yes.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.172 align:middle line:84%
And my parents
didn't have money.

00:13:34.172 --> 00:13:35.630 align:middle line:84%
You can go to these
private schools

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:37.713 align:middle line:84%
and still not have money
if you have scholarships.

00:13:37.713 --> 00:13:39.330 align:middle line:84%
So I had a scholarship
as a choir boy.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.164 align:middle line:84%
I was a chorister at
the Temple Church.

00:13:41.164 --> 00:13:42.830 align:middle line:84%
If you're a conspiracy
theorist, and you

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:47.980 align:middle line:84%
want to talk about the
Templars, and thereafter, I

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.570 align:middle line:84%
was a chorister at
the Temple Church.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:53.532 align:middle line:84%
So there's the whole
other thing we could--

00:13:53.532 --> 00:13:54.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We won't
talk about that.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:56.840 align:middle line:90%
Maybe in another show.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
digress too far, but I

00:13:58.570 --> 00:13:59.840 align:middle line:84%
would love to do that
show with you as well.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: I was brought up
on the fringes of Dan Brown's

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:01.810 align:middle line:90%
mind.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:02.830 align:middle line:90%
Put it that way.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, however, because
we had this family connection

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:13.110 align:middle line:84%
with horses, and then I started
a junk store at a flea market

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.780 align:middle line:84%
when I was 12 to raise
money to buy a horse

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:20.550 align:middle line:84%
and would clear up people's
garages from junk and flog it,

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:middle line:84%
and eventually
made enough money.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And then under the
tutelage of old Virginia,

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:30.120 align:middle line:84%
old Leicestershire horse
guys, got a racehorse

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.014 align:middle line:90%
off the track that was retired.

00:14:32.014 --> 00:14:33.430 align:middle line:84%
That's a way to
get a cheap horse.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.388 align:middle line:84%
And then retrained him
as a fox hunter and then

00:14:35.388 --> 00:14:38.250 align:middle line:84%
as a sport horse, as an event,
as a show jumper, et cetera,

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.520 align:middle line:90%
until I knew that job very well.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.655 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you
become a professional is

00:14:42.655 --> 00:14:44.780 align:middle line:84%
that frequently, if you
don't really have the money

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.510 align:middle line:84%
to enter at the top level, you
sort of have to enter where you

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:51.490 align:middle line:84%
can, and then it's this
sort of professionals

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:55.170 align:middle line:84%
to the wealthy people, who then
give you your apprenticeship.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:56.735 align:middle line:84%
And so I had that
apprenticeship.

00:14:56.735 --> 00:14:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's been
something that's lasted

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.180 align:middle line:90%
through the rest of my life.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.513 align:middle line:84%
It's one the best things that
could have happened to me.

00:15:01.513 --> 00:15:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: That's a
skill that will take you.

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You
would've never guessed

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.850 align:middle line:84%
how profound those
implications would

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.630 align:middle line:84%
be many, many years down the
road once you had your child.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:08.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:84%
So now we hear this
background, and most people

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.770 align:middle line:84%
are thinking, well, what a
plummy life that's been so far,

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:15.150 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So now you marry your
beautiful wife, Kristin.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.980 align:middle line:84%
You have a child, and
the child is what?

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Three or four years old
when you get the diagnosis?

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Two and 1/2, yeah.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:25.506 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Two and 1/2.

00:15:25.506 --> 00:15:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And so he's screaming
uncontrollably

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:28.860 align:middle line:90%
four hours at a time.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:29.206 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Yeah.

00:15:29.206 --> 00:15:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now your life is
like going to hell in one way.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.798 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Completely.

00:15:32.798 --> 00:15:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you love
this beautiful little boy,

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.430 align:middle line:84%
and you have nothing
really in your background

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:40.412 align:middle line:84%
is going to prepare
you to deal with this.

00:15:40.412 --> 00:15:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: Not as far
as I knew at that point.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:43.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about it.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.215 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: Well, one
of the things that I am

00:15:45.215 --> 00:15:47.740 align:middle line:84%
is I'm a journalist, so
that's what I became.

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:48.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do horses.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I've done
them professionally.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.270 align:middle line:90%
I still do them professionally.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm also a journalist,
and I've written

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.360 align:middle line:84%
for all the British
press, and I'm

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.920 align:middle line:90%
an author and so on and so on.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm a trained
observer, and one thing

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:04.156 align:middle line:84%
I could do, because
my son was nonverbal--

00:16:04.156 --> 00:16:05.530 align:middle line:84%
couldn't tell me
what he wanted--

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:08.220 align:middle line:84%
but I could observe what he
did physically with his body

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.390 align:middle line:90%
and follow that.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.870 align:middle line:84%
So what he wanted
to be was outside,

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.520 align:middle line:90%
and he tantrumed less outside.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And there will be quite
a lot of viewers who are

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.710 align:middle line:90%
dealing with autism right now.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:21.050 align:middle line:84%
For those viewers who are
dealing with autism right now,

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.280 align:middle line:84%
I know what you're
going through.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.280 align:middle line:90%
I'll look at the camera.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.655 align:middle line:84%
I know what you're
going through.

00:16:25.655 --> 00:16:26.500 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.472 align:middle line:84%
Those incessant,
neurologically-based tantrums--

00:16:29.472 --> 00:16:31.930 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing you can do,
except try to prevent the child

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:32.980 align:middle line:90%
from self-harming.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.770 align:middle line:84%
But out there in nature-- we
live in the countryside outside

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:38.010 align:middle line:90%
of Austin, Texas in the woods.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:38.960 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't tantruming.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.980 align:middle line:84%
This was interesting,
so that's where we were.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And then one day he
saw my neighbor's mare

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:44.920 align:middle line:90%
through the fence.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Now I had given up horses,
because I thought my son was

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:50.460 align:middle line:90%
not safe around horses.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.040 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I gave
up the thing that

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.540 align:middle line:84%
gave me the most joy
in life, and so you

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:59.120 align:middle line:84%
can imagine what a downward
spiral of depression I was in.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I was heading down
a bottle quite fast.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:06.099 align:middle line:84%
But he spotted this
horse, and instead

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:08.967 align:middle line:84%
of going right along the
trail as normal, went left,

00:17:08.967 --> 00:17:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and before I could grab him,
he'd gone through the fence

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.810 align:middle line:84%
and was on his back
under her hooves.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.849 align:middle line:84%
And I thought he was
going to get trampled.

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:21.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to win most rubbish
dad of the century here.

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:23.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm terrified.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:24.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm crawling up to
try and grab him

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:27.740 align:middle line:84%
to pull him back under the
wire, but instead something

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.320 align:middle line:90%
rather amazing happened.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Betsy, the name of this
horse, bent her head to him

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and began to lick and chew
and half closed the eye.

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And that behavior, if
you're a horse trainer,

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:41.600 align:middle line:84%
it's a submission and
acceptance gesture,

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.349 align:middle line:84%
very similar to a dog
showing it's belly.

00:17:43.349 --> 00:17:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And there are many, many ways
you can get a horse to do this,

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:47.910 align:middle line:84%
because they have very
structured hierarchies

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:50.350 align:middle line:84%
in their herds, so it's
not difficult to behave

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:53.480 align:middle line:84%
like a dominant horse and get
a horse to do this to you.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you have to really
as part of the training.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Here, you're
talking about a little child.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.775 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: I hadn't seen a
horse offer it spontaneously,

00:17:59.775 --> 00:18:02.700 align:middle line:84%
not to anyone, let alone a
babbling two and 1/2 year

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.210 align:middle line:90%
old autistic kid on his back.

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:09.000 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, there's some direct
line that I don't understand,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.340 align:middle line:90%
but I can observe it.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So we would go back
and back to Betsy,

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.310 align:middle line:84%
because he would just
run there in the morning.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And Betsy was an old quiet mare,
so I knew he wanted to get up.

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:22.130 align:middle line:84%
He would show me by trying
to jump next to her.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:23.902 align:middle line:90%
So I would put him on her back.

00:18:23.902 --> 00:18:24.860 align:middle line:90%
She wasn't a big horse.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And I could hold him like
this while she grazed.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:27.800 align:middle line:90%
I knew the horse.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.400 align:middle line:84%
I knew she was quiet
and older, and all

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.667 align:middle line:84%
of his stimming, all
the repetitive motions,

00:18:33.667 --> 00:18:35.250 align:middle line:84%
chanting, flapping,
that sort of thing

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.900 align:middle line:84%
that we associate with
autism-- we call it stimming,

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.000 align:middle line:84%
self-stimulatory
activity-- stopped

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.450 align:middle line:84%
when he was up there like
that using her as a couch.

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't occur to me
to ride with him, because I

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.290 align:middle line:84%
come from the English
tradition where you don't learn

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.220 align:middle line:84%
to ride in front of a parent,
because the English saddle

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.020 align:middle line:90%
doesn't allow that.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.840 align:middle line:90%
You fall out the front.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.630 align:middle line:84%
So everyone starts on
the lunge line and so on.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:57.530 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, in
Texas, it's different.

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:01.259 align:middle line:84%
So I spoke to my neighbor, and
he said, sure, give it a try.

00:19:01.259 --> 00:19:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And as luck would have
it, the saddle that he had

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.776 align:middle line:84%
was for a big old Texas butt,
like a real oversized saddle.

00:19:06.776 --> 00:19:10.750 align:middle line:84%
So there's plenty of room for
me and him, and I got up there.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.424 align:middle line:84%
And on the first day that
I was riding with them,

00:19:13.424 --> 00:19:15.090 align:middle line:84%
I was sort of searching
for inspiration.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.930 align:middle line:84%
I always used to speak to
him sort of rhetorically,

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:20.880 align:middle line:84%
a bit like having NPR
on in the background,

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.840 align:middle line:84%
assuming that he was taking in
more than he was understanding,

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.100 align:middle line:84%
receptive versus
expressive language.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I would always be
like, well, there's the sky.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.690 align:middle line:90%
It's blue.

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:29.330 align:middle line:90%
What is the sky?

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:30.260 align:middle line:90%
What is the pump?

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:30.870 align:middle line:90%
What is oxygen?

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:31.640 align:middle line:90%
What is the atmosphere?

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.820 align:middle line:90%
What's the pulmonary system?

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.653 align:middle line:84%
I'd talk like this,
because I thought, well,

00:19:34.653 --> 00:19:36.350 align:middle line:90%
one day, he probably will talk.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:37.972 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, we're up there.

00:19:37.972 --> 00:19:39.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm searching for
inspiration, so I said,

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.540 align:middle line:84%
should we go to the
woods or the pond?

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And he had echolalia, which is
where they will repeat things

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:45.694 align:middle line:84%
that they hear,
and they'll often

00:19:45.694 --> 00:19:47.360 align:middle line:84%
repeat the last three
words you've said,

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.200 align:middle line:84%
but they don't
really understand.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.114 align:middle line:84%
So he said, to the pond, which
is-- that's just echolalia.

00:19:52.114 --> 00:19:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Better than a kick
in the face, thought.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:53.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:56.580 align:middle line:84%
So we go down to the pond,
and a big blue heron gets up

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:90%
and flaps away.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.040 align:middle line:90%
And he said, heron.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.025 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
he knew that word.

00:20:01.025 --> 00:20:02.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh,

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's been listening.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.540 align:middle line:84%
He's been taking it
in on some level.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: And then I
start giving him choices,

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.656 align:middle line:84%
and he starts taking the
choices, directions--

00:20:09.656 --> 00:20:11.260 align:middle line:90%
left, right, fast or slow.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed very, very quickly
within that first session

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.470 align:middle line:84%
that the more I go with
the canter, the lope,

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:20.220 align:middle line:84%
as the Western people call
it, the more speech I get.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.262 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know why.

00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:22.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what's going on.

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some kind
of rhythmic something.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:25.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Yes.

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:26.975 align:middle line:84%
And subsequently, I
could now talk you

00:20:26.975 --> 00:20:29.100 align:middle line:84%
through the neurology of
exactly what was going on,

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:30.980 align:middle line:90%
but at the time, had no idea.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.380 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, I had
this thing that worked.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was ironic,
because that week

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.510 align:middle line:84%
was the week that his speech
therapist gave up on him

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.250 align:middle line:84%
and actually said,
sorry, I don't

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:41.610 align:middle line:90%
think this kid will ever talk.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.940 align:middle line:84%
So we, for the next two
and 1/2, three years,

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.410 align:middle line:84%
literally lived in the saddle
together three to four hours

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:48.210 align:middle line:90%
a day.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:49.730 align:middle line:90%
And I took books up there.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.132 align:middle line:84%
I painted letters
on trees, and we'd

00:20:52.132 --> 00:20:54.590 align:middle line:84%
ride from one to the other,
putting them together into-- it

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:55.615 align:middle line:90%
became "Lion King" characters.

00:20:55.615 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:90%
He was into "The Lion King."

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:58.828 align:middle line:84%
Intrinsic motivation--
there'd be a "Lion King"

00:20:58.828 --> 00:21:01.530 align:middle line:84%
toy waiting for him at the
end, and he learned to read.

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.692 align:middle line:84%
And I did the same with
numbers, and he learned--

00:21:03.692 --> 00:21:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As long as
he was on horseback.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.858 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: Yeah,
kinetic learning.

00:21:06.858 --> 00:21:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But-- and the horse
was cantering at the time.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.684 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: Well, we got our
best results at the canter,

00:21:12.684 --> 00:21:13.850 align:middle line:90%
but you can't always canter.

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:15.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But that makes sense.

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: But-- so when we
were working at the walk, say,

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:23.030 align:middle line:84%
or the trot, I made sure that it
was the most rhythmic possible.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
because with autism,

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.040 align:middle line:84%
this repetitious rhythmic
thing is going on anyway.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.614 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
that laid a context.

00:21:30.614 --> 00:21:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: It's
actually for all of us.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.350 align:middle line:84%
It's just that it's
more acute with them.

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, interesting.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: So OK.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.832 align:middle line:90%
Then Mongolia happens.

00:21:38.832 --> 00:21:41.290 align:middle line:84%
The reason Mongolia happened
is I have another side of my--

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:43.706 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, I have a question
before you go any further.

00:21:43.706 --> 00:21:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Before we get to
Mongolia, I want

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:46.646 align:middle line:84%
to talk about
horses for a moment,

00:21:46.646 --> 00:21:50.220 align:middle line:84%
because you went to find
amazing horsemen in Mongolia

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.720 align:middle line:84%
that the shamans
associated with horse,

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.090 align:middle line:90%
and then later reindeers.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.270 align:middle line:90%
Let's back up a sec.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:58.390 align:middle line:90%
What is it about horses?

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And two of my friends
are equine therapists.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.160 align:middle line:90%
What is it about horses?

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: The
horse-human connection?

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Well--

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Betsy would have known
to be gentle and submissive

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:11.909 align:middle line:84%
to this little boy
under her hooves.

00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: I should
preface anything

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.870 align:middle line:84%
I say by saying I'm
not a horse, and there

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.790 align:middle line:84%
is a danger within
the equine therapy

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:22.120 align:middle line:84%
world and the natural
horsemanship world and so on

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.947 align:middle line:84%
to make assumptions that one
could speak for an animal.

00:22:24.947 --> 00:22:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very much of the belief
that that's actually hubristic

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:28.450 align:middle line:90%
that one cannot.

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think you're right.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:29.960 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.700 align:middle line:84%
But as best you know as a
human, what do you observe?

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: So Betsy is the
alpha mare of that herd.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.370 align:middle line:84%
In wild horse behavior,
the alpha mare

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:42.566 align:middle line:84%
is a position that they
have more or less for life.

00:22:42.566 --> 00:22:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Alpha mare.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.814 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: Unlike
an alpha male.

00:22:44.814 --> 00:22:47.780 align:middle line:84%
An alpha male comes in, fights
his way out of a bachelor herd,

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.690 align:middle line:84%
challenges the alpha
stallion, fights off

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:54.260 align:middle line:84%
all comers for about two,
three years, then is exhausted

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and is kicked out, and
another one comes in.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And his sole job really is
to provide sperm, the best

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:01.270 align:middle line:90%
most vigorous sperm he can.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.590 align:middle line:84%
But he's usually not
the one who faces down

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:05.145 align:middle line:84%
the predator, that
sort of thing,

00:23:05.145 --> 00:23:07.436 align:middle line:84%
makes the decisions about
when to change pastures or go

00:23:07.436 --> 00:23:08.540 align:middle line:90%
for water or that.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:09.840 align:middle line:90%
That's the alpha mare usually.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.881 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The alpha mare.

00:23:10.881 --> 00:23:12.590 align:middle line:90%
OK, interesting.

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: And the alpha
mare holds that position

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.670 align:middle line:84%
until she's about
ready to keel over,

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:19.710 align:middle line:84%
and frequently, it's her
daughter or a close relation

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:21.190 align:middle line:90%
who will take it over.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:28.050 align:middle line:84%
So within the alpha mare psyche,
to take care of a juvenile

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:31.390 align:middle line:84%
is very much part
of their makeup.

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And you see this happen
across species all the time.

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.610 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever had to
bottle raise a lamb,

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:39.930 align:middle line:90%
it accepts the bottle from you.

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.344 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't just reject you
because you're a predator.

00:23:42.344 --> 00:23:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And then it will go
live with your dogs,

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:45.956 align:middle line:84%
and the dogs will accept
it as another dog.

00:23:45.956 --> 00:23:47.330 align:middle line:84%
I've got a baby
goat in the house

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:49.250 align:middle line:90%
right now that that's the story.

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:54.200 align:middle line:84%
We see this kind of cross
species nurturing going on.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.650 align:middle line:84%
You'll see a dog will
suckle another species.

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:00.010 align:middle line:90%
The list goes on.

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:03.870 align:middle line:84%
So I think there was
something of that,

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:06.260 align:middle line:84%
but there is an intangible
bond between the human

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.040 align:middle line:84%
and the horse, because
the horse is not

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:12.330 align:middle line:84%
the most effective and reliable
transport animal that we have.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Mules, donkeys, and camels
are much more reliable.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Elephants are, ironically,
easier to train than horses.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.255 align:middle line:84%
Horses are completely
dominated by their amygdala.

00:24:21.255 --> 00:24:23.630 align:middle line:84%
We're going to return to the
amygdala in a minute talking

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:25.330 align:middle line:84%
about autism, which is
the part of your brain

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:26.955 align:middle line:84%
that governs fight,
flight, and freeze.

00:24:26.955 --> 00:24:29.674 align:middle line:84%
And they solve their problems
by running away violently.

00:24:29.674 --> 00:24:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, they spook.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.798 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: And they
weigh what a truck weighs.

00:24:32.798 --> 00:24:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And you're working
with this thing.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.840 align:middle line:84%
Everyone who works
with horses gets hurt.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.270 align:middle line:90%
Why do we continue to do it?

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously,
in the old days,

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.250 align:middle line:84%
there was no thing
that you could

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:46.295 align:middle line:84%
go to battle on that
was as effective--

00:24:46.295 --> 00:24:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, speed.

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: --for
that very reason.

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's many things
that are as fast as a horse.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.210 align:middle line:84%
An elephant's as
fast as a horse.

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:53.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:54.743 align:middle line:90%
I mean your average horse.

00:24:54.743 --> 00:24:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Not a racehorse, but an elephant
could do 30, 35 miles an hour

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.800 align:middle line:90%
for sure, yeah.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Camels go fast, but
horses are maneuverable,

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:06.840 align:middle line:84%
and horses have a certain
aggression in them

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.050 align:middle line:90%
that you can tap into.

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And then they can
become an extension

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:12.900 align:middle line:90%
of the human on their back.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's this quality
they have more

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.375 align:middle line:84%
than any of the others
except, perhaps,

00:25:16.375 --> 00:25:19.450 align:middle line:84%
the elephant of draft
animals that carry us,

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:21.150 align:middle line:90%
that makes a horse exceptional.

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:25.140 align:middle line:84%
So a human being can project
his thoughts, his/her thoughts

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.820 align:middle line:90%
and dreams through the horse.

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So what horses represent
to us is dream and freedom.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And we become superhuman
the moment we're on a horse.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:40.730 align:middle line:84%
We're more beautiful, because
horses are so aesthetically

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:42.480 align:middle line:84%
beautiful, so the
moment we sit on one,

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.730 align:middle line:90%
we become part of that beauty.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.201 align:middle line:90%
People feel transformed.

00:25:45.201 --> 00:25:46.825 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: Well,
they are transformed.

00:25:46.825 --> 00:25:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
problems with this

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.590 align:middle line:84%
is that it can lead to
an explosion and then

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:52.075 align:middle line:90%
implosion of the human ego.

00:25:52.075 --> 00:25:54.930 align:middle line:84%
A lot of horse people are
not terribly nice people,

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.921 align:middle line:84%
because you are bigger,
better, faster as long

00:25:57.921 --> 00:25:58.920 align:middle line:90%
as you're on that horse.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:25:59.860 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you
get off the horse,

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:00.930 align:middle line:90%
you're like anybody else.

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:02.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you live your
life on horseback--

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, just take that
to the extreme in the polo

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:04.630 align:middle line:90%
clubs.

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:05.588 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Absolutely.

00:26:05.588 --> 00:26:08.810 align:middle line:84%
You can start to really
believe your own BS there.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Now the horse will
chuck you up from time

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:12.830 align:middle line:84%
to time in front of people
and embarrass you, which

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:14.080 align:middle line:90%
brings you back down to earth.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.302 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, that's
why the kings would always

00:26:17.302 --> 00:26:19.010 align:middle line:84%
say it was the only
honest counselor they

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.885 align:middle line:90%
had was their horses.

00:26:19.885 --> 00:26:23.920 align:middle line:84%
The horse would dump you
in front of your populace.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.870 align:middle line:84%
But even your faithful
do won't do that.

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:30.510 align:middle line:84%
So horses do play this
role with humanity,

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.350 align:middle line:84%
and I think that
in the 6,000 years

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:35.190 align:middle line:84%
or so that we've
domesticated them,

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:37.076 align:middle line:84%
there's been a human-horse
connection that's

00:26:37.076 --> 00:26:41.102 align:middle line:84%
caused a certain genetic melding
of certain types of people

00:26:41.102 --> 00:26:42.810 align:middle line:84%
with that animal like
there's dog people,

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.726 align:middle line:84%
there's horse people,
there's elephant people,

00:26:44.726 --> 00:26:47.850 align:middle line:84%
there's camel people,
bird people, et cetera.

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:53.030 align:middle line:84%
So Rowan comes from a
line of horse people.

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.200 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be
there, and that seems

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.140 align:middle line:84%
to be perhaps what's going
on with the Betsy connection.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.590 align:middle line:84%
But of course, there's an
intangible beyond that that one

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:01.740 align:middle line:90%
can't put one's finger on.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.286 align:middle line:90%
It's a spiritual connection.

00:27:03.286 --> 00:27:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And the whole
point of the spirit

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.845 align:middle line:84%
is one isn't supposed
to understand it.

00:27:06.845 --> 00:27:09.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm very comfortable
saying I don't know.

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:12.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand, but
I'm very grateful that I'm

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:84%
a recipient of that
spiritual generosity.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.990 align:middle line:84%
So from there, we take
the spirit to Mongolia.

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:21.540 align:middle line:90%
Your wife says, are you crazy?

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:22.980 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing
to our family?

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.021 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing to me?

00:27:24.021 --> 00:27:26.700 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing to our son?

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.530 align:middle line:90%
But you all packed up, and--

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: Well, there was
a reason we went to Mongolia.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.360 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't a random decision.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.500 align:middle line:10%
I have another professional
side of my life

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.920 align:middle line:10%
that we haven't discussed.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm a human rights
advocate in Africa.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.180 align:middle line:84%
My area is finding legal title
to ancestral land for hunting

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.340 align:middle line:90%
and gathering tribes.

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:49.500 align:middle line:84%
So imagine in America 150 years
ago before Indian reservations,

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.460 align:middle line:84%
there were people out there
working on behalf of, say,

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.590 align:middle line:84%
the Navajo tribe
or another tribe

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:57.080 align:middle line:84%
to get them legal
title to this area,

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.841 align:middle line:84%
fighting it through
in government,

00:27:59.841 --> 00:28:01.340 align:middle line:84%
and getting those
people onto there.

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And that would be me, and
I've done that in Botswana

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.860 align:middle line:84%
with hunting and gathering
called the Bushmen.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's because of my
family connections to them.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.960 align:middle line:84%
So the year that Rowan
was diagnosed with autism,

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.597 align:middle line:84%
and the same year
that he met Betsy,

00:28:13.597 --> 00:28:15.180 align:middle line:84%
I had to bring a
delegation of Bushmen

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.840 align:middle line:84%
to the United Nations and
the US State Department,

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.030 align:middle line:84%
preparing to taking their
government to court.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And some of these guys
on that delegation

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.630 align:middle line:84%
were trained healers and
shamans in their own culture.

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:27.070 align:middle line:84%
They met Rowan as
part of the journey.

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And they naturally said, oh,
we could do some work on him.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.055 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, well, why not?

00:28:31.055 --> 00:28:31.930 align:middle line:90%
Knock yourselves out.

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:32.920 align:middle line:90%
It's just prayer.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.690 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:39.820 align:middle line:90%
And to my-- it was intriguing.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Rowan really lost a lot of
the most obsessive symptoms

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.130 align:middle line:84%
of his autism in the five
days that he was with them.

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Now he fell back
again when they left,

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:53.340 align:middle line:84%
but I couldn't help but notice,
OK, radical and positive

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.530 align:middle line:90%
reaction to the horse.

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Radical and positive
reaction to these shamans.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm familiar with
that world anyway,

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.580 align:middle line:84%
because I saw my first
shamanic ceremony

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.287 align:middle line:84%
on my grandfather's farm in
Zimbabwe when I was seven.

00:29:03.287 --> 00:29:04.870 align:middle line:84%
We talked about my
English upbringing.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:06.786 align:middle line:84%
We haven't talked about
my African upbringing.

00:29:06.786 --> 00:29:10.020 align:middle line:84%
I had a hybrid, slightly
schizophrenic upbringing.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:14.087 align:middle line:84%
So to me, all the
other things we

00:29:14.087 --> 00:29:16.295 align:middle line:84%
were trying-- the collation
therapy, the ABA therapy,

00:29:16.295 --> 00:29:19.156 align:middle line:84%
the behavioral therapy, the
speech therapy, the OT, all

00:29:19.156 --> 00:29:20.780 align:middle line:84%
that were not really
working very well.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
see in the film,

00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:23.655 align:middle line:84%
I mean just the
cocktails in the morning

00:29:23.655 --> 00:29:26.030 align:middle line:84%
that you were putting together
to get the right nutrients

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and probiotics and vitamins
and everything else.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: And we
weren't even giving drugs.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:31.230 align:middle line:84%
We were just trying to do all
these supplements and so on.

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything
that you knew to do.

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: We did.

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:36.910 align:middle line:84%
But nothing happened as
radical as a reaction

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:39.690 align:middle line:84%
as these two things, so it was
natural for me to say, well,

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:42.440 align:middle line:84%
is there somewhere on the planet
that combines these two things?

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.010 align:middle line:90%
And if so, should we go there?

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:46.260 align:middle line:84%
It's not Africa, because
it's not a horse culture.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.930 align:middle line:84%
It's not here, because the
horse doesn't come from here.

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:50.530 align:middle line:90%
Where does the horse come from?

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:51.330 align:middle line:90%
Mongolia.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a little
look at a clip.

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:54.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:55.521 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:07.460 align:middle line:90%


00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:10.756 align:middle line:84%
-Our guide, Tulga, picked
us up at the airport

00:30:10.756 --> 00:30:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and took us into the
capital of Ulan Bator.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:16.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what I
was expecting exactly,

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:20.380 align:middle line:84%
but this depressed, post-Soviet
city wasn't quite it.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:24.500 align:middle line:84%
I'd expected the open step,
nomads, horses, Genghis Khan

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.290 align:middle line:84%
and all his warriors,
not an urban slum.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:31.505 align:middle line:90%


00:30:31.505 --> 00:30:33.755 align:middle line:84%
-I think it wasn't exactly
Rowan's vision of Mongolia.

00:30:33.755 --> 00:30:41.880 align:middle line:90%


00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:42.870 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:47.270 align:middle line:84%
So you arrived, essentially,
as you say, a Soviet slum.

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Ulan Bator.

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you go
from there, but let's

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.500 align:middle line:84%
talk about the
quality of the people

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.190 align:middle line:84%
you were meeting once you
got away from the city.

00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: Even in the
city, actually, in Mongolia,

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.130 align:middle line:84%
you're either in the middle
of a sort of post-Soviet slum,

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:06.880 align:middle line:84%
or you're on the
step with nomads,

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.629 align:middle line:90%
and there's no like transitions.

00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There are no suburbs.

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.605 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: No,
there's no suburbs,

00:31:10.605 --> 00:31:12.320 align:middle line:90%
and there's no farmland.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.590 align:middle line:84%
So the people in the
city really told us

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:18.500 align:middle line:84%
we have the same quality as
the people in the countryside.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And the people in the
countryside are all Buddhists.

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:24.970 align:middle line:84%
They're incredibly
accepting people.

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:26.360 align:middle line:90%
They're incredibly open people.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.090 align:middle line:90%
They're incredibly warm people.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Even though life is
physically quite demanding,

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:32.680 align:middle line:84%
the quality of
life is very high.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.490 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is self-determined.

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:36.000 align:middle line:90%
They have gender equality.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.760 align:middle line:84%
They all have enough physical
resources for well-being.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.480 align:middle line:84%
They're living very,
very close to nature

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:47.800 align:middle line:84%
in a very fulfilling way--
horses, working with livestock,

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.730 align:middle line:84%
working with ancestors, this
shamanic spiritual technology

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:53.360 align:middle line:84%
that they're using all the
time alongside the Buddhism.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:58.560 align:middle line:84%
So this creates happy human
beings, who are very accepting.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.237 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting, because
they weren't always like that.

00:32:01.237 --> 00:32:03.070 align:middle line:84%
If you think about what
Mongolia represented

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:04.029 align:middle line:90%
in the medieval times--

00:32:04.029 --> 00:32:04.986 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Genghis Khan.

00:32:04.986 --> 00:32:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: Yeah, they would
explode every two generations

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and kill everybody from the
Pacific to the Mediterranean,

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:11.870 align:middle line:90%
and they go home again.

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And what made them
stop, and what

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:17.280 align:middle line:84%
made them stop was
in the 17th century,

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.530 align:middle line:84%
some Tibetan monks walked
over the Altai Plateau,

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:22.440 align:middle line:84%
and introduced this
idea called Buddhism.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of those
moments in history

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:26.130 align:middle line:84%
a little bit like
the fall of apartheid

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:28.320 align:middle line:84%
or the bringing down
of the Berlin Wall

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.720 align:middle line:84%
or really the birth
of the United Nations

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.220 align:middle line:84%
and the EU after World
War II and 10,000

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:36.839 align:middle line:84%
years of tribal warfare in
Western Europe of people

00:32:36.839 --> 00:32:38.880 align:middle line:84%
sort of collectively
saying, yeah, you know what?

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:39.796 align:middle line:90%
Why are we doing this?

00:32:39.796 --> 00:32:43.080 align:middle line:90%
And choosing this better way.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But, still
that hardiness.

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: They're hardy,
but they're not aggressive.

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:47.671 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:32:47.671 --> 00:32:49.850 align:middle line:84%
That's a beautiful
combination of traits.

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: But loving.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:52.510 align:middle line:90%
They're compassionate.

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:54.010 align:middle line:84%
What defines Buddhism
is compassion.

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.150 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
has always struck me

00:32:57.150 --> 00:33:00.820 align:middle line:84%
about their lifestyle in other
films and books I've read

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.450 align:middle line:84%
and so forth is that there
is this element that's

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:06.840 align:middle line:84%
incorporated that there's
still time to create beauty

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.850 align:middle line:84%
in their homes-- the textiles,
the colors, the carvings,

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:10.760 align:middle line:90%
the paintings.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:11.070 align:middle line:90%
This is beautiful.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: This is
what you see actually

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:13.270 align:middle line:90%
in all indigenous societies.

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:17.590 align:middle line:84%
There's this idea that you need
to work as frenetically as we

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:22.730 align:middle line:84%
do to have leisure to create
art, conversation, cuisine,

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:23.720 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.180 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:29.950 align:middle line:84%
What you need is
competence economically.

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:32.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you're economically
competent at sheep rearing,

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.400 align:middle line:84%
if you're economically competent
at hunting and gathering,

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.400 align:middle line:84%
if you're economically
competent at Wall Street,

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.760 align:middle line:84%
actually all roughly
amounts to the same thing

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.710 align:middle line:84%
that you have a certain
leisure time, therefore,

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:45.874 align:middle line:84%
to indulge in the
arts and the sciences.

00:33:45.874 --> 00:33:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And they do.

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's represented
in every home.

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Absolutely, they do.

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:49.950 align:middle line:90%
No, absolutely.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:51.500 align:middle line:84%
The quality of life
is very high that way.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.291 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you have
high quality of life.

00:33:53.291 --> 00:33:55.080 align:middle line:84%
You have peaceful
people who are hardy,

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.590 align:middle line:84%
but who have also
carried through

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:57.880 align:middle line:90%
their shamanic traditions.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Yes.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so let's talk
about the initial contact.

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:05.550 align:middle line:84%
When you're watching
the film-- hey,

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:09.409 align:middle line:84%
let's just put a little
cut here in the film, where

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:13.179 align:middle line:84%
I think it's Kristin is dealing
with the shaman, who saying,

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:14.679 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is for the parents too.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And she's out of breath
jumping up and down,

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:19.798 align:middle line:84%
and there's a little
flogging and such going on.

00:34:19.798 --> 00:34:21.339 align:middle line:84%
Let's just show a
little bit of this.

00:34:21.339 --> 00:34:25.544 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:25.544 --> 00:34:26.344 align:middle line:10%
-OK.

00:34:26.344 --> 00:34:50.074 align:middle line:90%


00:34:50.074 --> 00:34:53.400 align:middle line:90%
-OK, it's all done now.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.350 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you tell us
what that was all about?

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Yes, I can.

00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:58.911 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you trying
to get rid of the evil--

00:34:58.911 --> 00:35:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: No, I was as
freaked out and bemused by that

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.760 align:middle line:84%
as you would be, because
I had so much experience

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.390 align:middle line:84%
with shamanism in
Africa with the Bushmen,

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:10.210 align:middle line:84%
where their method of doing
it is completely different.

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And the Bushmen healer
suffers for you.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.100 align:middle line:84%
If you have a Bushmen
healer working on you,

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.590 align:middle line:84%
he'll be pulling at you,
and you'll see him bleed.

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:19.390 align:middle line:90%
He'll bleed.

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:21.015 align:middle line:84%
He'll physically
start to bleed, things

00:35:21.015 --> 00:35:23.010 align:middle line:90%
like this on your behalf.

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:24.140 align:middle line:90%
He takes on all the pain.

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.765 align:middle line:84%
You feel this absolute
sort of blissful

00:35:25.765 --> 00:35:27.100 align:middle line:90%
buzzing through your body.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:28.884 align:middle line:90%
But the opposite in Mongolia.

00:35:28.884 --> 00:35:30.300 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that
it's a catharsis.

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:31.936 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You all
took a beating.

00:35:31.936 --> 00:35:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: So we got whipped.

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:37.660 align:middle line:84%
We got vodka and reindeer
spat in our faces.

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Kristin had to wash
her lady parts out,

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:44.219 align:middle line:84%
her childbearing
parts out with vodka.

00:35:44.219 --> 00:35:45.760 align:middle line:84%
On camera, there's
this hilarious bit

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.830 align:middle line:84%
in the movie, where Michael,
who's making the documentary,

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:51.315 align:middle line:84%
is trying to be true
to the documentary,

00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:52.720 align:middle line:84%
but he's desperately
embarrassed,

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.410 align:middle line:84%
because Kristin's washing
out her vagina with vodka.

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And she sort of turns
to him and says,

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:00.400 align:middle line:84%
well, you'll Photoshop
out my cellulite, right?

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's sort of that
moment of wry humor

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:05.650 align:middle line:90%
like we're all in this together.

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And Rowan's reaction
initially was not good,

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:09.130 align:middle line:90%
and I thought, oh, dear.

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Have I made a terrible,
terrible, terrible mistake?

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.380 align:middle line:84%
What happened was halfway
through that first ceremony

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.230 align:middle line:84%
that was so difficult
and challenging,

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:20.270 align:middle line:84%
something shifted, and
his mood went 180 degrees,

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and he started giggling,
laughing, joking, playing

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.230 align:middle line:90%
with the shamans.

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And then in between
sessions with them,

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:31.230 align:middle line:84%
he turned to this
boy about a year

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:33.270 align:middle line:84%
older than him, who was
there, who turned out

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:34.917 align:middle line:90%
was the son of our guide.

00:36:34.917 --> 00:36:36.750 align:middle line:84%
But we hadn't been
introduced at that point,

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:38.000 align:middle line:90%
didn't know who he was.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And opened his arms
and hugged this boy

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.870 align:middle line:90%
and said, Mongolian brother.

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And he hadn't reached out
to any other child ever.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.009 align:middle line:84%
He had played a bit when
other children were there

00:36:49.009 --> 00:36:50.800 align:middle line:84%
in what's called parallel
play, where he'll

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.850 align:middle line:90%
play while another child plays.

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:53.650 align:middle line:90%
But no interaction.

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:55.108 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No
engaging, no physical.

00:36:55.108 --> 00:36:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Zero.

00:36:56.350 --> 00:37:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And it happened there, and
that caused Tulga, our guide,

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.720 align:middle line:84%
to say, well, maybe I
should bring Tomoo, my son,

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.284 align:middle line:84%
on this journey, so it was two
fathers and their children.

00:37:07.284 --> 00:37:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And that turned
out to be the best

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:09.866 align:middle line:90%
decision that could've been.

00:37:09.866 --> 00:37:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Now this happened in
that shamanic ceremony.

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:13.790 align:middle line:84%
He made his first
friend, and he went

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:16.260 align:middle line:84%
from being completely
freaked out to suddenly being

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.840 align:middle line:84%
completely tickled and
giggly about the whole thing.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Something shifted, and
then it began to rain,

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.090 align:middle line:84%
and certain birds
flew in, all of which

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:28.105 align:middle line:90%
are shamanic signs of blessing.

00:37:28.105 --> 00:37:29.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And good fortune.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: And good fortune,
sort of ubiquitously no matter

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:33.730 align:middle line:90%
where you are in the world.

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And then we began the
journey from there,

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:38.800 align:middle line:84%
but I do have to say
that if I had really

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:42.530 align:middle line:84%
felt that Rowan was
in any sort of danger

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:44.477 align:middle line:84%
or that we were be
exploited in any way,

00:37:44.477 --> 00:37:46.560 align:middle line:84%
I'd have wrapped the whole
thing up and gone home.

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm a realist.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.827 align:middle line:84%
I'm not-- there's not a
new age bone in my body.

00:37:50.827 --> 00:37:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nor your wife's.

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: No.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:54.562 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have long hair,
so people think I'm-- no,

00:37:54.562 --> 00:37:57.145 align:middle line:84%
I have long hair I listened to
too much heavy metal when I was

00:37:57.145 --> 00:37:57.550 align:middle line:90%
a teenager.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:58.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:37:58.410 --> 00:37:59.090 align:middle line:90%
Metallica, there you go.

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: And it's Peter
Pan syndrome, which I'm not

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:02.300 align:middle line:90%
proud of, but there you go.

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:07.010 align:middle line:84%
But I'm very
practical by nature.

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you were
getting enough signs

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.760 align:middle line:84%
along the way and
enough validation.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.700 align:middle line:84%
But I want to bring
something up here.

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:16.000 align:middle line:84%
You talk about in the
documentary-- they brought it

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.140 align:middle line:84%
up-- that these shaman, as
they were working on your son,

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:21.510 align:middle line:84%
and I made a note
as I was watching

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:25.600 align:middle line:84%
this early on when your son
was having a tantrum at home.

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.590 align:middle line:84%
I thought, god, it's
almost the little guy

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:29.980 align:middle line:84%
has someone surfing off
him, almost like he's

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:31.430 align:middle line:90%
acting in a possessed way.

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And I say that loosely
speaking, but when

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:37.450 align:middle line:84%
they start working on
them, they were saying,

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:40.480 align:middle line:84%
no, there is this relative
from your wife's bloodline,

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.950 align:middle line:84%
the grandmother,
I believe it is.

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:42.750 align:middle line:90%
Who is--

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:44.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Not being helpful.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was attaching
herself to your son.

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And that brings up a
whole array of questions.

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Certainly.

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:54.340 align:middle line:90%
The easiest--

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when they
made that detachment

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.528 align:middle line:84%
is when you started
seeing breakthroughs,

00:38:57.528 --> 00:38:59.546 align:middle line:84%
when they started having
the entity move on.

00:38:59.546 --> 00:39:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: Yes, and
what's interesting

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:04.040 align:middle line:84%
about the whole idea
of ancestors, which

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:07.200 align:middle line:84%
is how shamanism works, so
the way shamanism works,

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.720 align:middle line:84%
very briefly, it's very
simple how shamanism works.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.600 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter whether it's
Native America, the Bushmen,

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:15.474 align:middle line:90%
the Arctic, Aboriginals.

00:39:15.474 --> 00:39:17.140 align:middle line:84%
No matter where you
are on planet Earth,

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:19.190 align:middle line:84%
it's the same,
because this goes back

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:21.790 align:middle line:84%
to the earliest days of what
it means to be a human being.

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So when a shaman goes into the
altered state of consciousness

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:27.030 align:middle line:84%
that they need to go
into in order to heal,

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:28.379 align:middle line:90%
they enter the spirit world.

00:39:28.379 --> 00:39:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And when they enter
the spirit world,

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.750 align:middle line:84%
they talk specifically
to ancestor spirits,

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:34.940 align:middle line:90%
to nature spirits, and to God.

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And there's a sort of a
three in one, one in three.

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:41.686 align:middle line:84%
They sort of are each
other and not each other,

00:39:41.686 --> 00:39:43.310 align:middle line:84%
but those are the
three basic entities.

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And then they come out with
a series of instructions,

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and the ancestor spirits
seem almost always there

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:48.870 align:middle line:90%
trying to help.

00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:51.840 align:middle line:84%
But occasionally,
they're getting it wrong.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.510 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that
it's malevolent.

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:58.460 align:middle line:84%
It's more that someone
might be carrying

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.750 align:middle line:84%
their human insecurities
over with them or something

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:02.160 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And by releasing this person,
this child, or whoever

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:10.460 align:middle line:84%
from the ailment that
they're suffering,

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:12.470 align:middle line:84%
you then release
that ancestor spirit

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:14.770 align:middle line:84%
from what was holding
them back on it.

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:16.640 align:middle line:90%
So it's sort of cyclical.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And this goes to the
core of the human psyche,

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:22.950 align:middle line:84%
so much so that if
you think about it

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:26.847 align:middle line:84%
in modern medical terms, one
person's DNA and genetics is,

00:40:26.847 --> 00:40:28.430 align:middle line:84%
of course, another
person's ancestors.

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:31.890 align:middle line:84%
What is genetics, if not
the study of your ancestors?

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:33.660 align:middle line:84%
So really, it's speaking
the same language

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:34.660 align:middle line:90%
but in different motifs.

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, depending on
the dimension you're looking at,

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:38.730 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, and a
realm you're looking at,

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:40.750 align:middle line:84%
it's the same thing
carrying for the same bonds,

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:41.900 align:middle line:90%
the same attachments.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:44.522 align:middle line:84%
It's in the spirit world or
through your physical DNA,

00:40:44.522 --> 00:40:45.480 align:middle line:90%
that's how it attaches.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Absolutely.

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
with that said, I

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:48.445 align:middle line:84%
think people should
be skeptical.

00:40:48.445 --> 00:40:53.260 align:middle line:84%
I think skepticism is a
very healthy human trait.

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:54.061 align:middle line:90%
Show me the money.

00:40:54.061 --> 00:40:56.143 align:middle line:84%
You don't want someone
coming up and saying, well,

00:40:56.143 --> 00:40:58.885 align:middle line:84%
I'm a shaman, because I went
for a two-day shamanic retreat

00:40:58.885 --> 00:40:59.760 align:middle line:90%
in Boulder, Colorado.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:40:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:02.181 align:middle line:84%
But-- OK, now let's
move this story forward.

00:41:02.181 --> 00:41:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: And here's 10,000.

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Give me 10 grand, and
I'll heal your kid.

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:06.576 align:middle line:90%
You don't want that.

00:41:06.576 --> 00:41:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, and
I'm with you on that.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.820 align:middle line:84%
The proof's in the
pudding, as they say.

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Absolutely.

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
started seeing proof.

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:13.240 align:middle line:84%
You started seeing
a shift in him

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:17.480 align:middle line:84%
after this ceremony in which the
grandmother's energy was asked

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.564 align:middle line:90%
to please leave the child.

00:41:18.564 --> 00:41:19.396 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Exactly.

00:41:19.396 --> 00:41:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And we had to do
a sort of homework

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.100 align:middle line:84%
each night of certain
little ceremonies with him.

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's go
on to the reindeer people

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.560 align:middle line:90%
and what happened.

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Now mind you, Rowan was
how old at this time?

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:29.720 align:middle line:90%
Three or four?

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Five and a half.

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Five and a half.

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:33.370 align:middle line:90%
And he was still incontinent.

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Oh, yeah.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:36.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you
guys could not train him.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: No washing machines,
by the way, on the set.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I know.

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:40.082 align:middle line:90%
There's one scene in there.

00:41:40.082 --> 00:41:41.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, and you called it what?

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:42.020 align:middle line:90%
The brown--

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Code brown.

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Code brown.

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:45.053 align:middle line:84%
So you had a lot of
code browns, where

00:41:45.053 --> 00:41:46.310 align:middle line:90%
he's pooping his pants a lot.

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Yeah.

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so this is
obvious-- any parent could

00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:51.607 align:middle line:84%
say, five and a half years
of pooping your pants-- that

00:41:51.607 --> 00:41:53.690 align:middle line:84%
would be enough for me
right there to drive me out

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:55.300 align:middle line:90%
of my mind.

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.620 align:middle line:90%
And the other stuff aside.

00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:00.035 align:middle line:84%
So this was a significant
issue in your lives,

00:42:00.035 --> 00:42:01.910 align:middle line:84%
and now let's talk about
the reindeer people.

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:02.890 align:middle line:90%
And then what happened?

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: OK.

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:07.544 align:middle line:84%
So we eventually traveled
up to southern Siberia,

00:42:07.544 --> 00:42:09.210 align:middle line:84%
which is where the
reindeer people live.

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:11.747 align:middle line:84%
And the reindeer people
are different to the people

00:42:11.747 --> 00:42:13.080 align:middle line:90%
of the plains, the horse people.

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:13.880 align:middle line:90%
They're older.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.090 align:middle line:90%
The culture's older.

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:17.430 align:middle line:84%
The first large animal,
in fact, after the ice age

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:19.320 align:middle line:84%
that was domesticated
was the reindeer.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:22.090 align:middle line:84%
All the other ones that
we know came later.

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a very,
very ancient culture

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:26.136 align:middle line:90%
and a non-warrior culture.

00:42:26.136 --> 00:42:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Very peaceful culture, and they
live entirely off the reindeer.

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.290 align:middle line:90%
They ride them.

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:31.540 align:middle line:90%
It's like going to fairyland.

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.200 align:middle line:84%
It's like the land of the
snow queen when you go there.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:33.800 align:middle line:90%
People are riding around--

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
arrive there expecting

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:37.660 align:middle line:84%
to meet the top--
you'd been told

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.090 align:middle line:84%
you could meet the
top shaman there,

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:41.682 align:middle line:84%
who was, I guess,
elderly or not well.

00:42:41.682 --> 00:42:42.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Absolutely.

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.810 align:middle line:90%
A guy called Ghoste, yes.

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:46.268 align:middle line:84%
And when you go to meet shamans,
one of the things you know

00:42:46.268 --> 00:42:47.819 align:middle line:90%
is that there's no guarantee.

00:42:47.819 --> 00:42:49.360 align:middle line:84%
I've had experience
with this before.

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.818 align:middle line:84%
There's no guarantee that they
will agree to work with you.

00:42:51.818 --> 00:42:53.080 align:middle line:90%
They may not think they can.

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.160 align:middle line:84%
You may not be
able to find them,

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.290 align:middle line:84%
because they've
gone somewhere else,

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:57.500 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to travel
four days on horseback

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.530 align:middle line:90%
to go get them or something.

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Any number of things, and
so it's quite fraught.

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:05.420 align:middle line:84%
But we did find
Ghoste, and Ghoste

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.410 align:middle line:90%
did agree to work on Rowan.

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And Ghoste is the name of this
healer of the reindeer people.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can we look
at that in the film?

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Yeah, absolutely.

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
it's really-- it's

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:16.480 align:middle line:84%
quite a dramatic-looking
characterization

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.000 align:middle line:84%
for any shaman the
way he appeared,

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.077 align:middle line:90%
and you were in the yurt.

00:43:21.077 --> 00:43:21.910 align:middle line:90%

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The ger.

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: Well,
actually then, teepees.

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tee pees.

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:25.500 align:middle line:90%
OK, so you're in the teepee.

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.964 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to pick the
film up at that place, OK?

was there, the way
the healing turned out

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:46.480 align:middle line:90%
was much closer to the Bushmen.

He could do it very quickly.

And he did several things.

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:01.761 align:middle line:84%
He offered run a small bowl
of reindeer milk, which

00:45:01.761 --> 00:45:04.010 align:middle line:84%
of course, Rowan rejected
and knocked out of his hand.

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And he caught it on
his drum and noted

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:10.320 align:middle line:90%
which side it had landed on.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And then he took off
his headdress, which

00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:14.970 align:middle line:90%
is always a bird headdress.

And Rowan accepted it, and
then turned around and put it

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:24.330 align:middle line:84%
on his own head and
then put it on my head.

put the drum down and said,

we're done.

00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:29.740 align:middle line:90%

long to get there.

They're not saints.

They're just people with
an affinity for healing.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And he said, OK, the stuff
that really drives you crazy--

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:54.560 align:middle line:84%
the incontinence, the
tantruming, that stuff-- that

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:56.140 align:middle line:90%
will all end right now.

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:59.135 align:middle line:90%


00:45:59.135 --> 00:46:01.260 align:middle line:84%
But to confirm this
healing, you're

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.790 align:middle line:84%
going to have to do three more
journeys over the next three

00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:04.590 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:06.420 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter where you go.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:07.410 align:middle line:90%
I know-- we talked.

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:09.620 align:middle line:84%
So he says, I know you
have an African background.

00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:10.480 align:middle line:90%
I know you've got the Bushmen.

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:11.190 align:middle line:90%
I've heard of those guys.

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:12.140 align:middle line:84%
I know they're
very good healers.

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:13.350 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
come back here,

00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:14.725 align:middle line:84%
because I understand
that getting

00:46:14.725 --> 00:46:16.660 align:middle line:84%
to this mountain in
Siberia is very difficult,

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:19.160 align:middle line:84%
and it's not really reasonable
to come back here every-- you

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:20.620 align:middle line:90%
know, we're talking like that.

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And he said, but you
are going to have to do

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:23.260 align:middle line:90%
these three more journeys.

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:25.177 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK,
fine, but what do

00:46:25.177 --> 00:46:26.760 align:middle line:84%
you mean it's going
to stop right now?

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:30.436 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been
around a lot of shamans.

00:46:30.436 --> 00:46:32.560 align:middle line:84%
They like to hedge their
bets a bit like doctors do

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:33.560 align:middle line:90%
and accountants.

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:37.420 align:middle line:84%
It's very rare that they'll
say, oh, it'll happen tomorrow.

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:40.680 align:middle line:84%
But we rode back
down that mountain,

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:46.540 align:middle line:84%
and 27 hours-- we counted it--
after leaving the reindeer

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:50.290 align:middle line:84%
camp, Rowan did his
first intentional poo

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:53.117 align:middle line:84%
and cleaned himself,
and it's on camera.

00:46:53.117 --> 00:46:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that was like
watching England win the World

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:58.050 align:middle line:90%
Cup, which will never happen.

00:46:58.050 --> 00:46:59.940 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't believe it.

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And then we counted
in the two weeks

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:06.020 align:middle line:84%
that it took to get from that
river back to Austin, Texas

00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:07.830 align:middle line:84%
where we live, because
we had to travel,

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:10.010 align:middle line:84%
and then we went via
London, et cetera.

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And we counted six
tantrums of any note.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Normally, that would have
been one day's worth.

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So what he also left
behind him in Mongolia

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:23.120 align:middle line:84%
was the inability
to make friends.

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.670 align:middle line:84%
He continued to develop
the friendship with Tomoo.

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That little boy.

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:26.973 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: And then
when he got back,

00:47:26.973 --> 00:47:29.223 align:middle line:84%
he made friends with all the
kids in the neighborhood.

00:47:29.223 --> 00:47:31.010 align:middle line:84%
So he came back-- he
went out autistic.

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:32.342 align:middle line:90%
He came back autistic.

00:47:32.342 --> 00:47:33.300 align:middle line:90%
I looked at the camera.

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:35.540 align:middle line:84%
I said, Rowan was
not cured of autism.

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Shamanism doesn't cure autism.

00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:38.750 align:middle line:90%
Horses don't cure autism.

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:40.360 align:middle line:90%
Nothing cures autism.

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Autism is a way of being.

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:45.050 align:middle line:84%
But there are challenges
within autism-- say,

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:47.450 align:middle line:84%
incontinence or sensory issues
or neurological issues--

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:48.680 align:middle line:90%
that we can address.

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And they had been addressed,
and so he came back

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:55.230 align:middle line:84%
a much, much more
functional autistic person.

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And from there,
never looked back.

00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And we did to make those
three subsequent journeys.

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:03.779 align:middle line:90%
I wrote about them.

00:48:03.779 --> 00:48:05.570 align:middle line:84%
I have a new book that's
about to come out.

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going
to ask you that.

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what happened
after Mongolia.

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: OK.

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:11.175 align:middle line:84%
So after-- there's
this book in this film

00:48:11.175 --> 00:48:13.050 align:middle line:84%
called "The Horse Boy,"
which tells the story

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:13.690 align:middle line:90%
through Mongolia.

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a book called
"The Long Ride Home,"

00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and it tells the story of those
three journeys and everything

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:21.310 align:middle line:84%
we've done subsequently
to sort of move this

00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:22.915 align:middle line:90%
into helping other kids.

00:48:22.915 --> 00:48:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How old is Rowan?

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:24.980 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: He's 13.

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:28.550 align:middle line:84%
So the first journey we
did was to the Bushmen,

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:31.670 align:middle line:84%
who I know personally, to
healers that I know personally.

00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And what resulted after
that, which was so bizarre,

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:36.500 align:middle line:90%
was this mathematical dialogue.

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.850 align:middle line:84%
There had been nothing
of that really.

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:40.480 align:middle line:90%
We'd done basic numeracy.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:49.430 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, Rowan was
mathematically agile, verbally,

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:50.960 align:middle line:84%
mentally, and so
on in this way that

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.540 align:middle line:84%
hadn't shown up before
when we came out of there.

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:57.250 align:middle line:84%
The second year we
were in Australia

00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:59.840 align:middle line:84%
with a very, very
good Kuku Yalanji

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:02.690 align:middle line:84%
shaman up in the Daintree
Rainforest, which is just

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:06.060 align:middle line:84%
below New Guinea in that
subtropical area by Cape

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Tribulation.

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And after that, Rowan developed
what was called theory of mind.

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:13.510 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you exactly
what happened.

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Theory of mind is when you
understand that I think

00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:16.430 align:middle line:90%
something different to you.

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:17.888 align:middle line:84%
So the best way to
understand it is

00:49:17.888 --> 00:49:20.370 align:middle line:84%
let's say there was a
picture of an elephant here,

00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:22.430 align:middle line:84%
and you have a two and
1/2, three-year-old kid.

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:23.545 align:middle line:84%
They'll pick it up
seeing the elephant

00:49:23.545 --> 00:49:25.370 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, look,
Mommy, an elephant,

00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:27.060 align:middle line:84%
thinking that you can
see what they see.

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere around three and
1/2, they'll go, hey, look,

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:29.850 align:middle line:90%
Mommy, an elephant.

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:31.210 align:middle line:90%
They'll turn it around.

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is a milestone
that almost all kids

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:35.759 align:middle line:84%
meet like speech, like pointing,
like all these other things

00:49:35.759 --> 00:49:39.410 align:middle line:84%
autistic people don't do without
you noticing it as a parent.

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:41.330 align:middle line:84%
But of course, it's
a hard one there,

00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:43.920 align:middle line:84%
and its perspective taking
as a survival skill.

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:45.210 align:middle line:90%
You've got to have this.

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:47.540 align:middle line:84%
He played his first
practical joke on me

00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:52.730 align:middle line:84%
as we were driving back out
from that rainforest of--

00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:54.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And humor is subtle.

00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:56.292 align:middle line:84%
It's his nuanced
way of thinking.

00:49:56.292 --> 00:49:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Absolutely.

00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And Kristin, who's a
developmental psychology--

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.387 align:middle line:84%
professor of
developmental psychology--

00:50:01.387 --> 00:50:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your wife.

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:03.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: --at the
University of Texas, his mom,

00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:04.950 align:middle line:84%
was sitting next to me
was like, oh, my god.

00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:05.910 align:middle line:90%
That's theory of mind.

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:07.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, what do
you mean theory of mind?

00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:08.873 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the psycho speaker.

00:50:08.873 --> 00:50:10.020 align:middle line:90%
And she explained it.

00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, he had
made that leap, and then

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:16.880 align:middle line:84%
the third year, we went
on the Navajo reservation

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.490 align:middle line:84%
here with a very
good Navajo shaman.

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I have a bit of a background
in the Navajo reservation,

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:24.410 align:middle line:84%
which we haven't gone into,
but I knew where to go.

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And what we got after that was
proper conversation at last,

00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:30.940 align:middle line:90%
and it was incredible.

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:34.410 align:middle line:84%
We were driving out after
the three days of ceremony,

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:35.830 align:middle line:90%
out of the Navajo reservation.

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:37.746 align:middle line:10%
There's Mount Taylor
hovering above the desert

00:50:37.746 --> 00:50:39.870 align:middle line:10%
like Kilimanjaro, this
sort of cloud floating

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:41.036 align:middle line:10%
in the air above the desert.

00:50:41.036 --> 00:50:42.275 align:middle line:90%
It was so beautiful at dawn.

00:50:42.275 --> 00:50:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, because
it's America, it's prosaic.

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Underneath Mount
Taylor is a truck stop,

00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:48.590 align:middle line:90%
a McDonald's, and a casino.

00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:51.150 align:middle line:10%
And we stopped between
there and Albuquerque.

00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:53.850 align:middle line:84%
We know that's where
we can get food.

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:57.280 align:middle line:84%
So we stop, and
Rowan wants to have

00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.510 align:middle line:84%
one of those horrible
fruity-flavored sugary drinks

00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:01.926 align:middle line:84%
with food dyes in it, which
I know will send him squiffy.

00:51:01.926 --> 00:51:03.050 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to have juice.

00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:04.010 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't want to have juice.

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, fruity-flavored,
fruity-flavored.

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:07.270 align:middle line:84%
He's still speaking
this sort of code

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:09.110 align:middle line:84%
and having this massive
tantrum on the ground with all

00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:10.360 align:middle line:90%
the truckers looking at me.

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I'm the hippie
parent, the bad parent.

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:13.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's me.

00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:16.974 align:middle line:84%
And we get back into
the car, and I'm grumpy.

00:51:16.974 --> 00:51:18.640 align:middle line:84%
He's grumpy, and I'm
saying, fine, fine.

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:19.180 align:middle line:90%
Just be grumpy.

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:20.020 align:middle line:90%
Spoil the whole day.

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.730 align:middle line:90%


00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:24.580 align:middle line:84%
So I become a
three-year-old basically.

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:26.496 align:middle line:84%
And we're driving out,
and he says to me, Dad,

00:51:26.496 --> 00:51:27.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm not being grumpy.

00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:30.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm just telling you
what drink I want.

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a different way
of handling things then, Dad.

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:35.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: Kristin and I,
we just pulled the car over

00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:36.594 align:middle line:84%
onto the shoulder
of the freeway,

00:51:36.594 --> 00:51:40.280 align:middle line:84%
I thought here and was
like, what did you say?

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And it never went
back from there.

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:47.490 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was we
realized that the shamans thing

00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:49.560 align:middle line:84%
and the horse thing was
very personal to us,

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:55.830 align:middle line:84%
but what we had discovered was
that if you observe your child,

00:51:55.830 --> 00:51:58.190 align:middle line:84%
and if you put your
child in nature,

00:51:58.190 --> 00:52:00.620 align:middle line:84%
and if you allow your child
to move in certain ways,

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:02.290 align:middle line:84%
and this is why I
go back to the lope

00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:04.090 align:middle line:84%
and these rhythmic
movements on the horse.

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:06.759 align:middle line:84%
You could emulate a lot of
these results we were getting

00:52:06.759 --> 00:52:08.550 align:middle line:84%
with Rowan without the
kids, and the reason

00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:11.890 align:middle line:84%
I knew this was when we go back
from Mongolia, I got curious.

00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Was it just my son, or
was it other kids too?

00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:17.330 align:middle line:84%
We now have one child in
68 over the age of eight

00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:20.850 align:middle line:84%
with autism, one boy in 56 over
the age of eight with autism.

00:52:20.850 --> 00:52:23.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's not difficult to
find other autistic kids.

00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:26.760 align:middle line:84%
So I started running unofficial
play dates with the horses,

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and also, on play equipment,
because most of the time,

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:29.820 align:middle line:90%
they weren't on the horse.

00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed it was
certain types of movement.

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:32.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That swings.

00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:33.480 align:middle line:90%
I mean, OK.

00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:34.610 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: And we eventually
took this to the neurologists

00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:38.760 align:middle line:90%
and said, what's going on?

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And they said, ah, look at the
way the hips are being rocked.

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.310 align:middle line:90%
This is oxytocin.

00:52:44.310 --> 00:52:47.620 align:middle line:84%
You're creating enormous
amounts of oxytocin in the kids.

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:48.890 align:middle line:90%
What's oxytocin?

00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:51.196 align:middle line:84%
The bliss, happiness,
communication, trust--

00:52:51.196 --> 00:52:52.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bonding chemical.

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: --and
communication hormone.

00:52:55.560 --> 00:53:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And basically, what we'd lucked
into was a discovery of this.

00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:03.074 align:middle line:84%
The basic problem with
autism, if that's the brain,

00:53:03.074 --> 00:53:03.990 align:middle line:90%
there's your amygdala.

00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:06.955 align:middle line:84%
The amygdala is what
governs your fight, flight,

00:53:06.955 --> 00:53:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and freeze response and produces
cortisol, your stress hormone.

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Many FMRI scans on autistic
people-- for example,

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Temple Grandin has
gone in for an FMRI scan

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:20.240 align:middle line:84%
as part of this
experiment-- show

00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:23.430 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of autistic people
have overdeveloped amygdalas.

00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:25.410 align:middle line:84%
That part of their
brain is way more

00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:27.540 align:middle line:84%
developed than yours
or mine, perhaps.

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:30.040 align:middle line:84%
So they're suffering from much
more anxiety, much more fear,

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.320 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, producing
much more cortisol.

00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got the nervous
system is being triggered

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:38.190 align:middle line:90%
to give misinformation.

00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:39.952 align:middle line:84%
So the easiest
way I can give you

00:53:39.952 --> 00:53:41.910 align:middle line:84%
to get you to understand
that is if you'll just

00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:43.147 align:middle line:90%
humor me for second.

00:53:43.147 --> 00:53:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Lick your finger, and wave
it around for a second.

00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:47.630 align:middle line:90%
Can you do that?

00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:48.822 align:middle line:90%
Does it feel hot or cold?

00:53:48.822 --> 00:53:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cold.

00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Right.

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:50.640 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Because as the water evaporates
from your epidermis--

00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:55.110 align:middle line:84%
but you're getting the
correct information.

00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:56.320 align:middle line:90%
But imagine if you didn't.

00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:58.834 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if for that moment,
someone flipped a wrong switch,

00:53:58.834 --> 00:54:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and it suddenly felt
like I'd held your finger

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:02.150 align:middle line:90%
to the hot burner of the stove.

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:03.100 align:middle line:90%
How would you react?

00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:04.230 align:middle line:90%
You'd melt down.

00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:05.570 align:middle line:90%
You'd fall to the ground.

00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:06.370 align:middle line:90%
You'd scream.

00:54:06.370 --> 00:54:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'd be overly
reactive all the time.

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:09.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: Yes, and
the gents in white coats

00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:11.890 align:middle line:84%
would be along to cart
you off to the funny farm

00:54:11.890 --> 00:54:13.050 align:middle line:90%
and pump you full of drugs.

00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So this is what's going on
for these kids all the time.

00:54:15.850 --> 00:54:18.100 align:middle line:10%
By putting them into
this form of movement

00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:21.110 align:middle line:10%
in natural environment when
none of these bad sensory

00:54:21.110 --> 00:54:24.620 align:middle line:10%
triggers like fluorescent strip
lights, like echoey spaces,

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:28.340 align:middle line:10%
like industrial noise, like the
hum of a refrigerator or an air

00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:31.070 align:middle line:10%
conditioner, like a yappy
dog, like cigarette smoke,

00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:33.510 align:middle line:10%
like perfume, like a million
of these things which

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:35.890 align:middle line:10%
could set them off into
this negative cycle

00:54:35.890 --> 00:54:38.580 align:middle line:10%
between this overdeveloped
amygdala and this misfiring

00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:41.430 align:middle line:10%
nervous system, you take
those triggers away,

00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:45.400 align:middle line:10%
and you start filling them
with the opposite of cortisol.

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.040 align:middle line:90%
Oxytocin-- it's the antidote.

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.950 align:middle line:84%
What cortisol does is
it narrows your focus.

00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:52.680 align:middle line:84%
If a bloke came through the
wall there with a kitchen knife,

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:54.100 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't be learning
about horse work.

00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:55.170 align:middle line:90%
You could deal with the bloke.

00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:56.890 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to learn
calculus while the elephant is

00:54:56.890 --> 00:54:57.690 align:middle line:90%
charging at you.

00:54:57.690 --> 00:54:59.310 align:middle line:84%
It narrows your
focus on the threat.

00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:01.160 align:middle line:84%
So if your brain is
constantly telling you

00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:02.800 align:middle line:84%
that there's an elephant
coming through the wall,

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.880 align:middle line:84%
you haven't got time
to learn anything else.

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Nothing to do with
your intellect.

00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very
narrow-minded focus.

00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:07.573 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Exactly.

00:55:07.573 --> 00:55:11.040 align:middle line:84%
Your intellect is capable of it,
but the hormones won't let it.

00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:14.980 align:middle line:10%
So what oxytocin does is it
gives you perspective focus.

00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:18.242 align:middle line:84%
It's like, hm, maybe I do
want to go to India next year.

00:55:18.242 --> 00:55:19.700 align:middle line:84%
I've always wanted
to learn French,

00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:21.626 align:middle line:90%
or I wonder what's over there.

00:55:21.626 --> 00:55:22.822 align:middle line:90%
That's that frame of mind.

00:55:22.822 --> 00:55:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So you put the kid in
that frame of mind,

00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:28.194 align:middle line:84%
but then three more
amazing things happened.

00:55:28.194 --> 00:55:30.110 align:middle line:84%
With this kind of rocking
and bouncing motion,

00:55:30.110 --> 00:55:31.940 align:middle line:90%
your cerebellum is activated.

00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Your cerebellum produces--
if you can remember this,

00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:37.760 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you a gold star--
the cerebellum produces

00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:41.070 align:middle line:84%
a series of cells within the
brain with a funny name called

00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:42.460 align:middle line:90%
Purkinje cells.

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Purkinje cells act as
circuits within the brain that

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:47.220 align:middle line:84%
get the different parts of your
brain to talk to each other.

00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:48.020 align:middle line:90%
Guess what.

00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:50.790 align:middle line:84%
In autistic people,
frequently, they

00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:52.970 align:middle line:84%
have a real deficit
of Purkinje cells.

00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:55.977 align:middle line:10%
So you get massive development
of this part of the brain,

00:55:55.977 --> 00:55:58.060 align:middle line:10%
not so much development
in that part of the brain.

00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, you're
dealing with that problem.

00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And one of the bits of the brain
that the Purkinje cells allow

00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:09.450 align:middle line:84%
to talk to the rest of the
brain is the prefrontal cortex.

00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And the prefrontal
cortex is the CEO.

00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:15.940 align:middle line:84%
It's what governs reason
and emotional regulation.

00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And so suddenly, these
kids are learning

00:56:18.830 --> 00:56:22.110 align:middle line:84%
and able to control their
emotions and able to reason

00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:25.280 align:middle line:84%
and so on, and finally,
through the Purkinje cells,

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.880 align:middle line:84%
the prefrontal cortex can
talk to the amygdala and say,

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:28.680 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:30.445 align:middle line:84%
There isn't an
elephant coming out

00:56:30.445 --> 00:56:32.160 align:middle line:90%
of the bush every five seconds.

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:33.300 align:middle line:90%
So you can relax.

00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And so then you create
a positive cycle.

00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:38.660 align:middle line:84%
So we opened a center,
where we train people

00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:40.930 align:middle line:84%
how to do this with horses,
with play equipment.

00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to
say those little swings that

00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:45.350 align:middle line:90%
rock automatically.

00:56:45.350 --> 00:56:48.540 align:middle line:10%
>>ISAACSON: Yes, the Gaiam
balls that you sit on,

00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:50.170 align:middle line:10%
the Gaiam exercise balls.

00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:51.360 align:middle line:90%
I'll plug your product.

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:52.810 align:middle line:90%
No, absolutely.

00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:56.100 align:middle line:84%
So if the kid is in the back
of the class rocking his chair,

00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:58.780 align:middle line:84%
it should not have the chalk
rubber thrown at his head

00:56:58.780 --> 00:56:59.684 align:middle line:90%
or be sent outside.

00:56:59.684 --> 00:57:01.350 align:middle line:84%
He's doing what he
needs to do to learn.

00:57:01.350 --> 00:57:02.650 align:middle line:90%
He's creating oxytocin.

00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you see an
autistic person rocking,

00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:09.510 align:middle line:84%
they always rock creating
oxytocin to self-soothe.

00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:11.764 align:middle line:84%
If you and I meet each
other, and we're all friends,

00:57:11.764 --> 00:57:12.930 align:middle line:90%
we'll give each other a hug.

00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:15.920 align:middle line:84%
That will get some oxytocin, but
if you are having a hard time,

00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:18.470 align:middle line:84%
and I want to comfort
you, I will rock you.

00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:20.200 align:middle line:84%
If I have my baby in
my arms, I rock him.

00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:21.429 align:middle line:90%
It's hard wired.

00:57:21.429 --> 00:57:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And all the things that we
do where our hips are rocked

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:27.130 align:middle line:84%
make us feel globally
a sense of well-being.

00:57:27.130 --> 00:57:28.894 align:middle line:84%
So rocking chairs,
dance, making love.

00:57:28.894 --> 00:57:30.310 align:middle line:84%
When you make love,
you don't just

00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:32.810 align:middle line:84%
feel a localized pleasure
in your genitals.

00:57:32.810 --> 00:57:34.810 align:middle line:84%
We hope, anyway, that you
feel this global sense

00:57:34.810 --> 00:57:35.410 align:middle line:90%
of well-being.

00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:36.210 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:57:36.210 --> 00:57:38.210 align:middle line:90%
It's the oxytocin at work.

00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:41.040 align:middle line:10%
So we had lucked into something
very simple and very profound

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:43.564 align:middle line:10%
that could work massively
with the horses,

00:57:43.564 --> 00:57:45.230 align:middle line:10%
because the movement
of the horse's hips

00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:48.280 align:middle line:10%
is so powerful that it gives
you more oxytocin for your buck

00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:49.440 align:middle line:10%
than anything else.

00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:52.060 align:middle line:84%
But most people aren't on
horseback 90% of the time.

00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:53.030 align:middle line:90%
But what about a swing?

00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.950 align:middle line:90%
What about the pool?

00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:54.950 align:middle line:90%
What about a trampoline?

00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:55.950 align:middle line:90%
What about my shoulders?

00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:56.920 align:middle line:90%
What about a wheelbarrow?

00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:59.110 align:middle line:84%
What about all sorts of
ways that we could do this?

00:57:59.110 --> 00:58:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So we now have three programs,
and we have Horse Boy Method

00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:05.490 align:middle line:84%
with horses, which is a
therapeutic riding program that

00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:07.590 align:middle line:84%
is now in 11 countries,
and it's just

00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:11.140 align:middle line:84%
been adopted in Germany
as the official autism

00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:15.006 align:middle line:90%
treatment with equine therapy.

00:58:15.006 --> 00:58:16.380 align:middle line:84%
We have Horse Boy
Learning, which

00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:18.470 align:middle line:84%
is a home school program, a
kinetic learning home school

00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:20.749 align:middle line:84%
program, where we put the
child in nature in all these

00:58:20.749 --> 00:58:22.290 align:middle line:84%
rocking balancing
things, and then we

00:58:22.290 --> 00:58:24.880 align:middle line:84%
show them how to learn the
national curriculum this way.

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:27.379 align:middle line:84%
This is what we started doing
with homeschooling with Rowan,

00:58:27.379 --> 00:58:30.054 align:middle line:90%
and we realized it was doable.

00:58:30.054 --> 00:58:31.720 align:middle line:84%
But then we thought,
most people are not

00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:33.220 align:middle line:90%
going to do it to this degree.

00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:34.594 align:middle line:10%
So then we come
up with something

00:58:34.594 --> 00:58:37.260 align:middle line:10%
called movement method, which
is the basic way for training

00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:39.650 align:middle line:10%
your brain, whether you're
suffering from anxiety,

00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:42.210 align:middle line:10%
depression, PTSD,
eating disorders,

00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:45.730 align:middle line:10%
let alone autism, ADD,
ADHD, and it works.

00:58:45.730 --> 00:58:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's learning how to
put you or someone you know

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:52.770 align:middle line:84%
or your child through these
very simple movements daily

00:58:52.770 --> 00:58:55.580 align:middle line:84%
to retrain the brain
into that positive cycle.

00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And so this is sort
of now what we do,

00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:01.530 align:middle line:84%
and so shamelessly plugging
my book, "The Long Ride Home,"

00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:03.210 align:middle line:90%
that's what it talks about.

00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:05.590 align:middle line:84%
The reason I want to
shamelessly plug it is this.

00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:09.640 align:middle line:84%
At our center in Texas
where we work now,

00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:11.850 align:middle line:84%
if you are a family
within 100 miles of us,

00:59:11.850 --> 00:59:14.040 align:middle line:84%
all our services
are completely free.

00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.000 align:middle line:10%
So obviously, by selling
copies of the book,

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to fund the program.

00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:19.541 align:middle line:10%
So please, everyone, by a
copy of "The Long Ride Home."

00:59:19.541 --> 00:59:20.560 align:middle line:10%
Get it on Amazon.

00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:25.020 align:middle line:10%
But more than that, if you're
in some sort of difficulty,

00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:28.150 align:middle line:10%
contact us, because we do a
lot of our training by webinar,

00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:30.210 align:middle line:10%
and it's very, very
easy to train people

00:59:30.210 --> 00:59:32.520 align:middle line:10%
into this basic brain
training technique,

00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:34.074 align:middle line:10%
and then you're
good to go already.

00:59:34.074 --> 00:59:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to spend
money on expensive therapists,

00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:39.540 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have to be
prey to people saying,

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:41.540 align:middle line:84%
oh, this treatment's going
to cost you $100,000.

00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:42.910 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no.

00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:44.384 align:middle line:90%
It's much, much, much simpler.

00:59:44.384 --> 00:59:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's more
primitive than that.

00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:48.502 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: It's more--

00:59:48.502 --> 00:59:50.835 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I mean that in
the best sense of the word.

00:59:50.835 --> 00:59:52.001 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: Yes, absolutely.

00:59:52.001 --> 00:59:54.130 align:middle line:84%
It's more
quintessentially human.

00:59:54.130 --> 00:59:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
quintessentially human.

00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:58.900 align:middle line:84%
We're out of time,
and all I can say

00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:01.810 align:middle line:84%
is thank god that you and
your wife, Kristin, both

01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:03.970 align:middle line:84%
have these incredible
powers of observation

01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:05.565 align:middle line:90%
to put these pieces together.

01:00:05.565 --> 01:00:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: Well, we had a
good tutor, which was our son.

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Without him, it couldn't
have happened-- and Betsy.

01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how's
he doing today?

01:00:11.090 --> 01:00:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ISAACSON: Rowan
is doing amazing.

01:00:12.050 --> 01:00:13.930 align:middle line:84%
He has his own web-based
television series

01:00:13.930 --> 01:00:16.125 align:middle line:84%
called "Endangerous"
about animals

01:00:16.125 --> 01:00:19.440 align:middle line:84%
that are both endangered and
dangerous, play on words.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:23.320 align:middle line:84%
So we've been tracking bears in
Romania, wolves in Yellowstone.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:26.650 align:middle line:84%
He's pretty stoked to produce
his own media around this.

01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:28.830 align:middle line:90%
He's extraordinary.

01:00:28.830 --> 01:00:30.360 align:middle line:90%
So there you go.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank
you for really just

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:35.312 align:middle line:84%
a beyond fascinating story,
a really profound story

01:00:35.312 --> 01:00:37.020 align:middle line:84%
with the way you put
it together and what

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:38.810 align:middle line:84%
you're doing for others,
and I want to thank you

01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:41.440 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of everybody watching
who feels a little bit of hope

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.732 align:middle line:90%
now as a result of seeing this.

01:00:42.732 --> 01:00:43.731 align:middle line:90%
>>ISAACSON: You're kind.

01:00:43.731 --> 01:00:45.165 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me on.

01:00:45.165 --> 01:00:47.040 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To check out
the entire documentary

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:51.640 align:middle line:10%
or purchase books and DVDs, you

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
