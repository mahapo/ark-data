>>REGINA MEREDITH: So how
does a layperson become

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.880 align:middle line:10%
a medical expert on Dr. Oz?

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.040 align:middle line:10%
Journalist Max
Lugavere has done it

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.620 align:middle line:10%
based on a passion for
learning and a passion

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.100 align:middle line:10%
to help his mother diagnosed
with dementia at a young age.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.700 align:middle line:84%
His mission, how do we stop
our brain from degenerating?

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.020 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show!

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.570 align:middle line:84%
This is a little more
humble than Dr. Oz's set.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.610 align:middle line:90%
No live audience.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.410 align:middle line:90%
None of that.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MAX LUGAVERE: But I love it.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just you and me.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.500 align:middle line:90%
The crystal's a nice touch.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.910 align:middle line:84%
You won't see that, probably,
in the other studio, I'm sure.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: I feel
like it's giving me

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.460 align:middle line:84%
positive vibes for
this interview.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: I'm excited.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, tell us, first
of all, about your background.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.550 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing
is this came about

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.220 align:middle line:84%
and, obviously, you have
that telegenic appeal.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.470 align:middle line:84%
You had already been
involved in journalism,

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.840 align:middle line:84%
so you were, kind of,
primed to be able to take

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.470 align:middle line:90%
a message forward, so to speak.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.500 align:middle line:84%
So, let's talk a little bit
about your background in media,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.900 align:middle line:84%
with television
journalism and so forth,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.000 align:middle line:84%
before you became
involved in this issue.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.788 align:middle line:10%
Well, you hit the
nail on the head.

00:01:24.788 --> 00:01:28.220 align:middle line:10%
So, my background is as
a TV host and journalist

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.320 align:middle line:10%
doing things not too
dissimilar to what

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.980 align:middle line:10%
you're doing with the show.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.900 align:middle line:10%
My show is on a network
called Current TV that

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:10%
existed between--

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.650 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I remember that.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.710 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't that Al Gore's?

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.084 align:middle line:10%
>>LUGAVERE: It was Al Gore's
TV network between the years

00:01:39.084 --> 00:01:41.392 align:middle line:10%
of 2005 and 2011.

00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:42.850 align:middle line:10%
It was my first
job out of college.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.683 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It was a nice
millennial, kind of,

00:01:44.683 --> 00:01:46.670 align:middle line:10%
network doing popular
issues of the day.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.470 align:middle line:10%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.190 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I was just
out of college,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.310 align:middle line:10%
super green, but excited to
really empower young people,

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.890 align:middle line:10%
fellow young people, to
take the reins of media

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.680 align:middle line:10%
and democratize a medium
that had long been closed off

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.490 align:middle line:10%
to young people.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.295 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
thought it was great.

00:01:59.295 --> 00:02:00.095 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:02:00.095 --> 00:02:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I did that for five to
six years wearing many hats

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.870 align:middle line:90%
at the network.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, they hired me
because I was always, sort of,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.860 align:middle line:90%
a one man band storyteller.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.850 align:middle line:84%
In college, I majored
in psychology and film.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was really dedicated to
telling stories my own way.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.730 align:middle line:84%
With the lowering price of
technology, at the time,

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.204 align:middle line:84%
and the democratization
of media,

00:02:25.204 --> 00:02:27.620 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really know what I
wanted to do when I graduated.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.064 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that I wanted
to do something that

00:02:30.064 --> 00:02:31.230 align:middle line:90%
made an impact on the world.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.760 align:middle line:84%
I was, in college, really
obsessed with Krishnamurti.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.477 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:35.477 --> 00:02:37.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: And you
know, I just really felt

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.060 align:middle line:84%
like I wanted to do something
that, at the same time,

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.460 align:middle line:84%
entertained people
and inspired people,

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.920 align:middle line:84%
but made them a little bit
smarter than they were before.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And so Current TV
was this amazing job

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.760 align:middle line:84%
where I got to cover really
hard hitting journalism.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.765 align:middle line:84%
But then, really,
sort of, light topics

00:02:54.765 --> 00:02:56.390 align:middle line:84%
at the same time
because I like it all.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.040 align:middle line:90%
You know, I was a generalist.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.320 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a well-rounded person.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.730 align:middle line:90%
You know, I contain multitudes.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And so Current TV really
gave me the ability

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.030 align:middle line:84%
to explore the breadth
of my interests.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:84%
It also allowed me
to explore projects

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.680 align:middle line:90%
that I was passionate about.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.740 align:middle line:84%
So, I've always had a
lifelong passion in health,

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and wellness, and fitness just
as an aside, just something

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:90%
that I was really interested in.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.700 align:middle line:84%
This is because,
as a high schooler,

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.800 align:middle line:90%
I was always terrible at sports.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.720 align:middle line:84%
But I gravitated towards
computer programming.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And when I discovered
exercise, something

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.250 align:middle line:84%
clicked in my brain where I
really started to see exercise,

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and supplements, and the
foods that I was eating

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.350 align:middle line:90%
as software for the human body.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And so, at Current, I was
really interested in spreading

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.780 align:middle line:84%
this message that
food is information,

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.000 align:middle line:84%
and technology is
really coming to a point

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.910 align:middle line:84%
where it's empowering health
in unprecedented ways.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.430 align:middle line:90%
And that's, sort of, what I did.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.140 align:middle line:90%
And you know, it was amazing.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.050 align:middle line:90%
I learned a lot.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.222 align:middle line:84%
I got to work with Peabody
Award winning journalists.

00:04:02.222 --> 00:04:04.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, there was really
no better job for somebody

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.130 align:middle line:84%
who was really
cutting his teeth in--

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.171 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's ideal.

00:04:06.171 --> 00:04:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah,
in storytelling.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.370 align:middle line:84%
When I left Current TV,
the network ultimately

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.990 align:middle line:90%
didn't succeed, unfortunately.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.209 align:middle line:84%
Viewership plateaued
and there are probably

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:90%
a million reasons for that.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.280 align:middle line:84%
But I left, sort of, having
my fill as a storyteller.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.420 align:middle line:10%
So, as I was in this
gray area living in L.A,

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.950 align:middle line:10%
living the young, Hollywood,
quasi, glamorous life

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:10%
that being on TV entails, I
would touch base with my mom

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.650 align:middle line:10%
frequently because I'm
very close with my mom.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.900 align:middle line:10%
And she lived back in
New York at the time.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.200 align:middle line:90%
Still does.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And she started to complain
to me about brain fog.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.640 align:middle line:90%
You know, it was, I guess, 2011.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of
chalked up what she

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.270 align:middle line:90%
was telling me to just aging.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How old
was she at the time?

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: She was
in her late 50s.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.060 align:middle line:84%
A little young for that
to be happening but yeah.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah, young.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:07.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean, vibrant.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.970 align:middle line:84%
She had just, basically,
retired from running

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.180 align:middle line:90%
a very successful business.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And you know, my
mom's a New Yorker.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.350 align:middle line:90%
New Yorkers walk fast.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.550 align:middle line:90%
They talk fast.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.770 align:middle line:84%
They tend to be
passionate about things.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And so this was a
pretty unexpected thing,

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.500 align:middle line:84%
and especially because I
had no prior family history

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.580 align:middle line:90%
of any kind of dementia.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my maternal
grandmother-- my mom's mom--

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.460 align:middle line:84%
was in her 90s at the time
and was, cognitively, sharp

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.200 align:middle line:90%
as a tack.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.940 align:middle line:84%
So I was completely caught
off guard, and confused

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.400 align:middle line:84%
and, ultimately, I
wasn't even very alarmed

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.060 align:middle line:84%
because I just kind of thought
that it was just something

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.712 align:middle line:90%
that was par for the course.

00:05:57.712 --> 00:05:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The normal process.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Of aging, yeah.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.910 align:middle line:84%
So, in this, sort of, downtime
where I was in between jobs,

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.650 align:middle line:84%
I would spend more and more
time in New York catching up

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.510 align:middle line:84%
with her and my two
brothers that live there.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And we started to notice that
something in my mom's gait,

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.375 align:middle line:84%
the way that she
walked, changed.

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:19.750 align:middle line:90%


00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.360 align:middle line:90%
Her stride shortened.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And it also seemed as if her
processing speed in her brain

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.150 align:middle line:90%
had been reduced.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.050 align:middle line:84%
So I would always look forward
to a home cooked meal, right,

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.570 align:middle line:84%
when I went back to New York
and I would be with my mom.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.670 align:middle line:84%
I'd help her cook many
times because I've always

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:40.482 align:middle line:90%
been a foodie.

00:06:40.482 --> 00:06:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And I've always been very health
conscious, as I mentioned.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.610 align:middle line:84%
So I'd always be in the kitchen
with her trying to make sure

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.890 align:middle line:84%
that she was using healthy
products, and foods,

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.600 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, never white
pasta, only whole wheat.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.960 align:middle line:84%
I was sort of like the little
health lobbyist in the family

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.839 align:middle line:90%
for as long as I can remember.

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And I would notice
on these occasions

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.171 align:middle line:84%
when I would start to
come back to New York

00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:02.740 align:middle line:84%
and spend more time
with her that it

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.865 align:middle line:84%
seemed as if her processing
speed had been reduced.

00:07:04.865 --> 00:07:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Almost like when you
play a video in a web

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.010 align:middle line:84%
browser with too many
open tabs, there's

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.282 align:middle line:90%
like a stuttering frame rate.

00:07:10.282 --> 00:07:11.740 align:middle line:84%
I would be in the
kitchen with her,

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and I would ask her for
salt, which would be--

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.980 align:middle line:84%
for any person-- it
would just be a quick,

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.032 align:middle line:84%
like, you receive
the information,

00:07:20.032 --> 00:07:22.240 align:middle line:84%
you reach up into the cabinet,
grab salt, and pass it

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.519 align:middle line:90%
to the person asking.

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:25.060 align:middle line:84%
It would take her
a few extra seconds

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.421 align:middle line:84%
to process that to the point
where it would be quicker,

00:07:27.421 --> 00:07:29.170 align:middle line:84%
even if I was standing
across the kitchen,

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.503 align:middle line:90%
for me to go and grab it myself.

00:07:30.503 --> 00:07:31.746 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:31.746 --> 00:07:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: And yeah, we all
knew something was wrong.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And she had a few appointments
with neurologists,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.290 align:middle line:90%
but there was no diagnosis.

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.740 align:middle line:84%
It was very unclear as
to what was going on.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And everything
seemed to culminate.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.670 align:middle line:84%
One weekend we were
in Miami, the family.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.380 align:middle line:90%
My parents were divorced.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.230 align:middle line:84%
But once a year, my mom
and dad would get together.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And the family would
take a vacation to Miami

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:09.270 align:middle line:84%
where my dad lives, and
we'd crash at his house.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:14.290 align:middle line:84%
It had been a pretty nice way
for us all to get together.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that,
on this occasion,

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:84%
she was standing in
my dad's kitchen.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And she announced to
the family that she

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:28.176 align:middle line:84%
had been having memory problems
and was seeing a neurologist.

00:08:28.176 --> 00:08:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Again, we didn't
think that there

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.890 align:middle line:90%
was anything major going on.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.909 align:middle line:84%
And so my dad who is even
less privy to this information

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:42.669 align:middle line:84%
than me and my brothers jokingly
mocked what my mom was saying.

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Not in any malicious
way, but just

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.420 align:middle line:84%
because we were genuinely--
we were all ignorant.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And my dad said something
to the effect of,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.050 align:middle line:84%
if you're having memory
problems, what year is it?

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And my mom couldn't
recall the year.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And me and my
brothers chimed in.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.005 align:middle line:90%
We were like, come on, mom.

00:09:01.005 --> 00:09:03.720 align:middle line:90%
How could you not know the year?

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was evident on her face
that she was really struggling,

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.220 align:middle line:90%
and she started crying.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me,
was like, you know,

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:18.370 align:middle line:84%
when the 6 Train is shuffling
into the Union Square Station,

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:21.500 align:middle line:84%
and the breaks come on, and
it's screeching to a halt.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.650 align:middle line:84%
That's sort of what I
experienced in my head

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:24.450 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.261 align:middle line:84%
You know, there was life
as I had known it before.

00:09:27.261 --> 00:09:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And there was what was going
to become my new reality.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.441 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I had to
move back to New York,

00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:33.190 align:middle line:84%
or at least spend more
time there, and get

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.270 align:middle line:84%
to the bottom of what
my mom was experiencing.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:39.730 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, we ended up
booking a trip to the Cleveland

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.870 align:middle line:90%
Clinic because there--

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.290 align:middle line:84%
this was before I had any
concept of functional medicine.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:48.990 align:middle line:10%
So functional medicine is this
new style of medical treatment

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.990 align:middle line:10%
where they, basically, look
at the whole system as opposed

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.640 align:middle line:10%
to just treating a symptom.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Before I had any
concept of that,

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.390 align:middle line:84%
I had heard that
the Cleveland Clinic

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.910 align:middle line:84%
was known for taking a,
sort of, team approach.

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, they get a
neurologist in the room.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.614 align:middle line:84%
They get a cardiologist
in the room.

00:10:03.614 --> 00:10:05.280 align:middle line:84%
They get an endocrinologist
in the room,

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.780 align:middle line:84%
and they figure out
what's going on.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So, we took my mom
there for that reason.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was there that
my mom was diagnosed

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.490 align:middle line:84%
with a neurodegenerative
disease.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:18.300 align:middle line:84%
She was prescribed medications
for Parkinson's disease

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.290 align:middle line:90%
and Alzheimer's disease.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
first time in my life

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.550 align:middle line:90%
that I had a panic attack.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's hard.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.670 align:middle line:84%
When you're close to your
mom and you're still young.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:31.564 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You
know, your world is

00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:33.060 align:middle line:84%
altered if there's
something that's

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.390 align:middle line:84%
going down there that's a
road that you don't recognize,

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.350 align:middle line:90%
and she doesn't either.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.260 align:middle line:84%
So I think every
mom, and every son,

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.100 align:middle line:84%
and child can understand
how that happens.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're still
inextricably intertwined.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And based on old
patterns of good health.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And my mom is really young, and
blonde, and funny personality.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, she does not look
like the picture of somebody

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.750 align:middle line:84%
who is succumbing to
the ravages of aging.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, after this
train hit you, so to speak,

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.080 align:middle line:84%
something flicked
on in your own brain

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.670 align:middle line:84%
that you were going to make this
your mission to understand it.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:18.030 align:middle line:84%
So, after the initial
trauma subsided,

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:22.650 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I have something
that very few people have,

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.720 align:middle line:90%
and that is media credentials.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm verified on Twitter.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.420 align:middle line:90%
Verified on Facebook.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.190 align:middle line:84%
I can access people that
very few people can access.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.130 align:middle line:84%
I had a blogger
account on Psychology

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Today because I studied
psychology in college,

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.532 align:middle line:84%
and I've always really been
interested in psychology.

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.490 align:middle line:84%
I had a Blogger account
on the Huffington Post.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.760 align:middle line:84%
So I've, basically,
set my life up

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.677 align:middle line:84%
in a way where I have platforms
to reach out to people should

00:11:48.677 --> 00:11:50.260 align:middle line:84%
I ever become
interested in something.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.801 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:51.801 --> 00:11:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: In one fell
swoop, all of my passions

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.910 align:middle line:84%
fell to the wayside
with the exception

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:59.670 align:middle line:84%
of trying to figure out what
was happening to my mom.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And I used my
access to reach out

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.500 align:middle line:90%
to scientists and researchers.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.776 align:middle line:84%
I began reading
research on PubMed.

00:12:06.776 --> 00:12:08.400 align:middle line:10%
You know, we live in
an incredible time

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.820 align:middle line:10%
now where all
scientific knowledge

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.130 align:middle line:10%
is available on the
internet for anybody.

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.535 align:middle line:84%
It's in my pocket 24 hours
a day, at my fingertips.

00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:17.335 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:17.335 --> 00:12:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: Not every research
study is fully available,

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.040 align:middle line:90%
but there are abstract.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.225 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a lot of
really amazing information

00:12:25.225 --> 00:12:26.100 align:middle line:90%
that you could learn.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.160 align:middle line:84%
You could become an expert in,
pretty much, anything today.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.080 align:middle line:84%
The fact that I wasn't
a medical doctor

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:36.760 align:middle line:84%
did not give me any
pause whatsoever.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: I just
rolled up my sleeves,

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.754 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, I'm
going to learn everything

00:12:40.754 --> 00:12:43.350 align:middle line:84%
that I can about the
impact of nutrition

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.870 align:middle line:90%
and lifestyle on brain health.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.575 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, it
became about my mom.

00:12:48.575 --> 00:12:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
that I could do

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:56.460 align:middle line:84%
to help my mom improve
her symptoms as an adjunct

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:84%
to the medications, which
five seconds after googling,

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:04.020 align:middle line:84%
you realize the medications have
no disease modifying ability.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.510 align:middle line:10%
They don't alter
disease progression.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:07.730 align:middle line:90%
And there's a funny line.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:08.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not funny.

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:09.613 align:middle line:90%
It's actually kind of sad.

00:13:09.613 --> 00:13:12.540 align:middle line:90%


00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a medical
school joke about how

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:20.580 align:middle line:90%
neurologists approach cases.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And they say that neurologists
don't treat disease,

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.281 align:middle line:90%
they admire it.

00:13:24.281 --> 00:13:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's because there
are no good medications

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.600 align:middle line:90%
for these diseases.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: So, I
just became obsessed.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And I also, on the other
hand, which is something

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:41.690 align:middle line:84%
that, intuitively, it struck me
as something really important,

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.940 align:middle line:84%
was to focus on prevention
because I learned that changes

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.280 align:middle line:84%
begin in the brain decades
before the first symptom

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.870 align:middle line:90%
of memory loss.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Nobody was talking
about it at the time.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.380 align:middle line:90%
I had no mentor to look up to.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.237 align:middle line:84%
But I was like,
you know, I assumed

00:13:54.237 --> 00:13:56.070 align:middle line:84%
that if I were to take
all of these insights

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:59.100 align:middle line:84%
that I was learning about how
to properly nourish a brain

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and apply them to
myself, then maybe I

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.080 align:middle line:84%
would have a chance
of not developing

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.140 align:middle line:84%
the mental monstrosity
that my mom developed.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned,
really, was striking.

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:14.570 align:middle line:84%
There's a wide body of
research out there really

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:17.210 align:middle line:84%
clearly elucidating
that our choices matter

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to not only
our cognitive health,

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.380 align:middle line:90%
but our cognitive function.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I started
putting these things that I

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.080 align:middle line:84%
was learning into
practice in my own life,

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:30.110 align:middle line:84%
I felt almost from
one day to the next,

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.592 align:middle line:84%
that my brain started
working better too.

00:14:32.592 --> 00:14:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, by
this time, first of all,

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:38.870 align:middle line:84%
in the very early
parts of your search,

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.420 align:middle line:84%
your grandma lived
to be 96, right?

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she did not
have any of these issues.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Right.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.363 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your mother did.

00:14:44.363 --> 00:14:45.202 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:14:45.202 --> 00:14:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you look into
the notion of how much of it

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.560 align:middle line:90%
is genetic, for example?

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And did you make any
discoveries in that area

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.300 align:middle line:84%
as to what science,
as it is, which

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.750 align:middle line:90%
is malnourished itself, right--

00:14:58.750 --> 00:14:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --understood
stood to be

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:06.499 align:middle line:84%
genetic versus environmental
toxicities and so forth.

00:15:06.499 --> 00:15:08.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean because that's one
question people wonder.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Well how come it didn't
happen to your grandma,

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.940 align:middle line:90%
but it did happen your mom?

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.421 align:middle line:84%
So, what changed, right, between
my grandmother's generation

00:15:15.421 --> 00:15:17.545 align:middle line:84%
and my mom's that led to
my mom developing dementia

00:15:17.545 --> 00:15:18.530 align:middle line:90%
and my grandmother not?

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you would
assume that they share,

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:21.770 align:middle line:84%
at least, some genes
in common, right?

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: So, the most well
defined Alzheimer's risk gene

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.340 align:middle line:90%
is called the APOE4 allele.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.020 align:middle line:90%
And one in four people have it.

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.880 align:middle line:90%
So this is a very common gene.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Polymorphism,
which is out there.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Basically, one in four
people that are watching

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:41.870 align:middle line:84%
carry and increased genetic
risk for this disease.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What triggers it?

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Or look at it from an
epigenetic point of view.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.200 align:middle line:84%
So, what's so
critical to understand

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.460 align:middle line:84%
is that we know about
the impact of this gene

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.670 align:middle line:84%
on one's cognitive
health because

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.730 align:middle line:90%
of correlational studies.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:02.070 align:middle line:84%
But there are parts in the world
where people have this gene,

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and there is no increased
risk for Alzheimer's disease.

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:07.010 align:middle line:84%
So, what is it about
the interaction

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.890 align:middle line:84%
between this gene,
and our diets,

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:12.050 align:middle line:84%
and our lifestyles
in the modern world

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.904 align:middle line:90%
that's putting carriers at risk?

00:16:13.904 --> 00:16:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what did
you learn on that?

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah,
so what I learned

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:18.450 align:middle line:90%
is that there's a lot going on.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:20.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know,
we live in a world

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.400 align:middle line:84%
and we eat foods that are
completely out of harmony

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.094 align:middle line:84%
with the world in which
our brains evolved.

00:16:25.094 --> 00:16:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
parts of the world

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:30.560 align:middle line:84%
did you find that though
this same gene exists,

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.140 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't triggered to
develop into dementia?

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: In hunter-gatherer
communities in Nigeria,

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:38.300 align:middle line:90%
for one.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they eat diets that--

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:41.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Basic paleo, kind of.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:42.743 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah, exactly.

00:16:42.743 --> 00:16:44.030 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they eat beans.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.620 align:middle line:84%
They eat legumes and
things like that.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.570 align:middle line:84%
But they eat
dramatically less sugar.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: And they eat much
less carbohydrates, overall,

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.360 align:middle line:90%
than we do.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.151 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a lot
more proteins and fats.

00:16:55.151 --> 00:16:57.200 align:middle line:84%
They drink more milks,
for example, raw milks.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yes.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And they eat a much
higher fiber diet.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:16:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:00.350 align:middle line:90%
Higher fiber.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:01.891 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: And we
can talk about why

00:17:01.891 --> 00:17:04.880 align:middle line:84%
fiber may act as a shield
to our brain health.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.760 align:middle line:10%
And that's through
the gut brain axis,

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.980 align:middle line:10%
which is a really
new area of science.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:08.570 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:10.550 align:middle line:10%
>>LUGAVERE: But in
the United States,

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:12.070 align:middle line:10%
this gene puts us
at higher risk.

00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:13.069 align:middle line:90%
There's other research--

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:15.245 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 'Cause of very refined
diet, high in carbohydrates.

00:17:15.245 --> 00:17:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Exactly.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.390 align:middle line:10%
Really high in processed
foods, in grains

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:22.880 align:middle line:10%
that we've been told
for decades should

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.891 align:middle line:10%
make the foundation of our
diets, which are essentially--

00:17:25.891 --> 00:17:27.349 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that bogus pyramid.

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah, the
bogus food pyramid,

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:30.650 align:middle line:84%
which, thankfully,
is now defunct.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.410 align:middle line:10%
But we still have
the my plate guide,

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:35.480 align:middle line:10%
which says that
1/4 of every plate

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.630 align:middle line:10%
should be constituted by
grains, which provide no benefit

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:39.620 align:middle line:10%
whatsoever to us.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:43.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, at best, in a healthy
body, grains are benign.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.278 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: But really, there
is no benefit to eating them.

00:17:46.278 --> 00:17:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we know that
a very small percentage

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:52.730 align:middle line:84%
of the population gets
adequate micro-nutrients

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:53.570 align:middle line:90%
from their diet.

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Magnesium, selenium,
iodine, things like that.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.509 align:middle line:84%
So we're not eating
the vegetables

00:17:58.509 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:84%
that we know that
we should be eating

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.716 align:middle line:84%
that actually do
provide benefit that we

00:18:01.716 --> 00:18:03.860 align:middle line:90%
know we've co-evolved with.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And we're now basing
a fourth of our diets

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:08.930 align:middle line:84%
on grains, which
have only existed

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:11.420 align:middle line:84%
in the past second of human
evolution, essentially.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.040 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, so as you
started this, we're

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.240 align:middle line:84%
going to go into a lot of
different constituents of it.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.656 align:middle line:84%
Some of the influences that
are out there that are popular

00:18:19.656 --> 00:18:20.660 align:middle line:90%
today that people know.

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.720 align:middle line:84%
But you decided, OK, if
it's affecting your mom,

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.220 align:middle line:84%
it probably took two or
three decades of whatever.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's toxicities, diet
health practices and so forth.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.700 align:middle line:84%
So, now you're
concerned not only

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.670 align:middle line:84%
to hunt down the answer
for this for your mom,

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:37.490 align:middle line:84%
but also for your own
generation to start really

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:38.720 align:middle line:90%
from a preventative level.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.190 align:middle line:90%
And you created a documentary.

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:40.540 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:41.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:45.175 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, we're almost
finished with my documentary,

00:18:45.175 --> 00:18:46.300 align:middle line:90%
which is called Bread Head.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.980 align:middle line:84%
It's the first ever and
only documentary focused

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.960 align:middle line:90%
solely on preventing dementia.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.190 align:middle line:84%
In it, I've interviewed
all of the top researchers

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.990 align:middle line:90%
in the field.

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:56.330 align:middle line:84%
We've traveled to
the Charite Hospital

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:59.570 align:middle line:84%
in Berlin, which is one of those
research intensive institutions

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:00.590 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.590 align:middle line:10%
We've traveled to the Karolinska
Institute in Stockholm, Sweden

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.690 align:middle line:10%
where they've done the first
ever, large population,

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:10.430 align:middle line:10%
long-term trial to prove
that with our diets

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:13.150 align:middle line:10%
and our lifestyles, we
can significantly delay

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:15.880 align:middle line:10%
the onset of cognitive decline.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.640 align:middle line:84%
I've even enrolled
myself in a study

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.990 align:middle line:90%
taking place in New York City.

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:22.870 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, we've really gone to
great length in the documentary

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:27.220 align:middle line:84%
to have the science
be bullet proof

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:31.720 align:middle line:84%
and to really pave a roadmap
towards dementia prevention

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.520 align:middle line:90%
for young people.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why don't we take a
little quick look at the teaser

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:35.920 align:middle line:90%
for your documentary.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.720 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.579 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Sure.

00:19:37.579 --> 00:19:38.545 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:38.545 --> 00:19:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: There's a clap.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.570 align:middle line:90%
This is a film about you.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:43.900 align:middle line:90%
This is a film about me.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.790 align:middle line:84%
This is a film
about your parents.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.040 align:middle line:84%
This is a film about
everyone we've ever

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.780 align:middle line:90%
known that has a brain.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:50.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm Max Lugavere.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.590 align:middle line:10%
And I'm inviting you
to participate with me

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.960 align:middle line:10%
in a project that I
think has the potential

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:10%
to do a lot of good
for a lot of people.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a documentary
film that's going

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.820 align:middle line:84%
to pose the question, what if
America's most feared disease

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.700 align:middle line:84%
is a choice that we
make at checkout?

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>> About 5.2 million people in
the US had Alzheimer's in 2014.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And that number is expected
to, roughly, triple by 2050.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: This is my mom.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.540 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Kathy.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.521 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel?

00:20:20.521 --> 00:20:21.934 align:middle line:90%
>> Pretty good.

00:20:21.934 --> 00:20:23.224 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah?

00:20:23.224 --> 00:20:24.640 align:middle line:84%
About three years
ago, she started

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.332 align:middle line:84%
showing signs of cognitive
difficulty and memory loss.

00:20:27.332 --> 00:20:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Anything you want to know?

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.360 align:middle line:10%
>>LUGAVERE: Where
are you right now?

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.840 align:middle line:10%
>> In our rental apartment.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.880 align:middle line:10%
>>LUGAVERE: No, no, no.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:34.880 align:middle line:10%
Be serious.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.265 align:middle line:10%
>> I am.

00:20:36.265 --> 00:20:37.890 align:middle line:10%
>>LUGAVERE: It was
definitely traumatic

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:10%
coming to terms with the
idea that my mom could

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.180 align:middle line:10%
have some kind of
neurodegenerative disease.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.657 align:middle line:10%
Because I have no prior
family history of dementia,

00:20:44.657 --> 00:20:46.740 align:middle line:10%
it sent me down the rabbit
hole to figure out ways

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.100 align:middle line:10%
that I could not only help her
but also prevent future memory

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.300 align:middle line:10%
loss for myself, as well.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.979 align:middle line:90%


00:20:53.979 --> 00:20:56.520 align:middle line:84%
We are heading to Providence,
Rhode Island where we are going

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.705 align:middle line:90%
to meet Susan de la Monte.

00:20:58.705 --> 00:21:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Who is one of the top neuro
pathologists in the world.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:07.260 align:middle line:84%
I read articles that posited
this idea of Alzheimer's being

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.490 align:middle line:90%
type 3 diabetes.

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:09.960 align:middle line:90%
A form of diabetes of the brain.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.410 align:middle line:84%
That struck me as being a really
powerful idea because we know

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.430 align:middle line:90%
why people become diabetic.

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:20.580 align:middle line:10%
You're credited as having
coined the term type 3 diabetes.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that diabetes type
3 is an accurate description

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:24.959 align:middle line:90%
of Alzheimer's disease?

00:21:24.959 --> 00:21:27.208 align:middle line:84%
>>SUSAN DE LA MONTE: I think
it's a great description.

00:21:27.208 --> 00:21:28.680 align:middle line:84%
When we first saw
the phenomenon,

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.550 align:middle line:84%
we started making a list of
what happens in diabetes,

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:33.960 align:middle line:90%
what happens in the brain?

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And you go down the
list, everything's there?

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:36.340 align:middle line:10%
>>LUGAVERE: Just a
few short months ago,

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.400 align:middle line:10%
one of the most prestigious
medical journals in the world

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.230 align:middle line:10%
said that one in three
Alzheimer's cases

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:41.342 align:middle line:10%
may be preventable.

00:21:41.342 --> 00:21:43.800 align:middle line:10%
>>ALESSIO FASANO: We're talking
about the shift of paradigm

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:44.600 align:middle line:10%
here.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.720 align:middle line:10%
Some genes may put you at
risk for Alzheimer's there.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.260 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that there is
no destiny that you develop

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:54.361 align:middle line:90%
Alzheimer's.

00:21:54.361 --> 00:21:56.619 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: Changes in
the brain begins 30 years

00:21:56.619 --> 00:21:57.660 align:middle line:90%
before the first symptom.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I'm here
shooting this video

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.290 align:middle line:84%
asking you to co-create
with me a documentary

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.554 align:middle line:84%
to take a journey to the
cutting edge of neuroscience.

00:22:03.554 --> 00:22:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Along the way, we're going to
challenge some very commonly

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.636 align:middle line:84%
held assumptions that
we make about what

00:22:07.636 --> 00:22:09.420 align:middle line:90%
constitutes a healthy diet.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.212 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that whole grains are
a key player in healthy eating.

00:22:12.212 --> 00:22:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>>DE LA MONTE: Six to
11 servings per day

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:14.720 align:middle line:90%
is what we need.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Just like the gasoline
for the human body.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:18.663 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: All to
figure out whether or not

00:22:18.663 --> 00:22:21.480 align:middle line:84%
America's most feared disease
is inevitable or avoidable based

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.847 align:middle line:90%
on choices that we make.

00:22:23.847 --> 00:22:25.430 align:middle line:84%
If you know anybody
who's been touched

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:27.444 align:middle line:84%
by any kind of
neurodegenerative disease,

00:22:27.444 --> 00:22:29.610 align:middle line:84%
share this campaign with
them, and please contribute

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:31.970 align:middle line:84%
because neurodegenerative
diseases

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:34.160 align:middle line:84%
truly rob us of the
essence of who we are.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.455 align:middle line:90%
And yet, they don't have

00:22:35.455 --> 00:22:36.255 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:22:36.255 --> 00:22:37.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: There's
truly nothing

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.640 align:middle line:84%
more powerful than an
idea whose time has come.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.670 align:middle line:90%
So help me make this film.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.330 align:middle line:90%
Co-create it with me.

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's spread the
message far and wide.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.650 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:51.779 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So actually, good job.

00:22:51.779 --> 00:22:52.695 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Thank you.

00:22:52.695 --> 00:22:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This journey,
even for you, started young

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.568 align:middle line:84%
because when you
were a little kid,

00:22:56.568 --> 00:22:59.460 align:middle line:84%
they thought you had ADHD, which
is a kind of garbage bucket

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.970 align:middle line:90%
diagnosis anyway.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so,
let's talk about that.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.770 align:middle line:90%


00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:09.562 align:middle line:84%
When I moved back to
New York to really see

00:23:09.562 --> 00:23:11.061 align:middle line:84%
what was what with
my mom, I started

00:23:11.061 --> 00:23:12.900 align:middle line:84%
spending a lot more
time in her apartment.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.617 align:middle line:84%
And my mom-- she doesn't like
to admit it-- but I think she

00:23:16.617 --> 00:23:17.700 align:middle line:90%
can be a bit of a hoarder.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:18.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: She would kill me
if she heard me saying that,

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.510 align:middle line:90%
but she's got a lot of stuff.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And I always find, like, really
precious family heirlooms

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.240 align:middle line:84%
unearthed and just
sitting like they're

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.892 align:middle line:84%
nothing on the coffee table
in front of the television.

00:23:29.892 --> 00:23:31.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, mom, this is
a really precious thing.

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:34.474 align:middle line:84%
It shouldn't just be sitting out
for the cats to walk all over.

00:23:34.474 --> 00:23:35.640 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So on this particular
occasion, what I found

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.800 align:middle line:84%
was a note that was
written by the resource

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.089 align:middle line:84%
room of my elementary
school to my mom and my dad.

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:45.630 align:middle line:84%
This is, obviously,
way before email.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:48.960 align:middle line:84%
So the physical evidence
was there, plain as day.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And what it was,
it was a counselor

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:56.550 align:middle line:84%
at my school telling my
mom that Max is very easily

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:59.490 align:middle line:84%
distractable, as is often
the case with people

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:01.500 align:middle line:90%
who are intellectually gifted.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:05.634 align:middle line:84%
But we recommend that Max
see a counselor to really try

00:24:05.634 --> 00:24:07.675 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what's going
on with his attention.

00:24:07.675 --> 00:24:09.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, and a little
Ritalin may help too, right?

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.438 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:10.438 --> 00:24:13.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, thankfully, I was
never prescribed Ritalin.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:14.096 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:14.096 --> 00:24:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: But I've
always struggled

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:20.160 align:middle line:84%
with maintaining focus on
things that I wasn't completely

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.450 align:middle line:90%
consumed with.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:23.130 align:middle line:90%
My brain works like a switch.

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:27.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, either I'm completely
obsessed with a topic,

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.250 align:middle line:84%
or it's really hard
for me to focus on it.

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And I struggled all throughout
elementary school, high school.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't think I've ever--

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.040 align:middle line:84%
I probably shouldn't
let this be on record,

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.100 align:middle line:84%
but I don't think I've ever
finished a single book that we

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.440 align:middle line:84%
had to read in high school
because I've always struggled

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.180 align:middle line:90%
so hard to read these books.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was the
identical profile of you.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.180 align:middle line:90%
A's in anything I cared about.

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.690 align:middle line:84%
A plus's and, kind
of, C-minus and D just

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:53.880 align:middle line:84%
because I could ace the
test at the last moment.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.640 align:middle line:84%
On everything else,
couldn't focus.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.570 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't interesting.

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Right.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.897 align:middle line:84%
But if you give me a
neurophysiology textbook,

00:24:59.897 --> 00:25:01.230 align:middle line:90%
I'll read it from front to back.

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.645 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: And I will remember
even the most minute details.

00:25:03.645 --> 00:25:05.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's actually set me
up for what I'm doing now.

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:09.450 align:middle line:84%
It's the perfect personality
to do it you've taken on.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:12.180 align:middle line:84%
You also started writing a
book called Genius Foods.

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.980 align:middle line:10%
You know, obviously,
a compilation

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:15.650 align:middle line:10%
of a lot of what you've learned.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:17.316 align:middle line:84%
And then, somewhere
you were discovering

00:25:17.316 --> 00:25:18.960 align:middle line:84%
and you ended up
on Dr. Oz, right.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:20.676 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, how
did that happen?

00:25:20.676 --> 00:25:23.490 align:middle line:84%
How did a layperson end up
talking about, essentially,

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:25.192 align:middle line:90%
medical conditions on Dr. Oz?

00:25:25.192 --> 00:25:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: That's an
amazing question, Regina.

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:30.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have really
become dedicated

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.660 align:middle line:84%
to learning as much as I
can, but also using my skill

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:37.440 align:middle line:84%
set, which is communication
and being media savvy, being

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.890 align:middle line:84%
a good storyteller,
to really get

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:42.510 align:middle line:84%
what I consider to be the
most important topic there

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:45.180 align:middle line:84%
is out to young people
because young people--

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:46.800 align:middle line:84%
I know because I
was this person--

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.600 align:middle line:84%
young people don't
care to listen

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.890 align:middle line:90%
to a doctor in a lab coat.

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:51.735 align:middle line:84%
They also don't really
care about dementia.

00:25:51.735 --> 00:25:52.535 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:52.535 --> 00:25:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: So I began
creating videos on YouTube.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:00.060 align:middle line:90%
I began blogging.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, I began
writing Genius Foods,

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.910 align:middle line:84%
which is what I consider
to be an owner's

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:07.500 align:middle line:90%
manual for your brain.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Rather than tell
you about the foods

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.130 align:middle line:84%
that you can't and
shouldn't eat--

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:12.270 align:middle line:90%
we get into that too--

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:13.920 align:middle line:84%
but Genius Foods is
all about the foods

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.720 align:middle line:84%
that you really
should eat, that you

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.090 align:middle line:84%
should be eating more
of on loop to optimize

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:19.170 align:middle line:90%
your cognitive function.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: You know, they found
that dietary diversity back

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.840 align:middle line:84%
for the vast majority
of our evolution

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.280 align:middle line:90%
was probably a virtue.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, the more
nutrients, the better

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.490 align:middle line:90%
when we were foragers.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Dietary diversity today
in a modern supermarket

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:39.610 align:middle line:84%
is not a good strategy
for our health.

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:42.390 align:middle line:84%
They found that
people that abide

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:44.490 align:middle line:84%
by the eat everything
in moderation rule

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:46.910 align:middle line:84%
actually use that as an
excuse to eat more junk foods.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: Like sodas and
confectionery products,

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:50.550 align:middle line:90%
pastries, and things like that.

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Basically,
it's like, it's all good.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:52.980 align:middle line:90%
Just don't eat too much.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Exactly.

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:53.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:54.623 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Exactly.

00:26:54.623 --> 00:26:57.070 align:middle line:84%
So that advice to eat everything
in moderation is bunk.

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: The
healthiest people

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:04.040 align:middle line:84%
buy a small group of
healthy foods on loop.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And in Genius
Foods, we highlight

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.230 align:middle line:84%
the specific foods that have
a strong body of evidence

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:12.210 align:middle line:84%
to suggest that
they really boost

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:14.050 align:middle line:84%
not only our long
term brain health

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:16.432 align:middle line:84%
but our cognitive function
in the here and now.

00:27:16.432 --> 00:27:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK now, in that, do
you take into consideration

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:22.350 align:middle line:84%
the individuality, such
as the metabolic typing

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.222 align:middle line:90%
kind of information?

00:27:23.222 --> 00:27:24.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Absolutely.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:26.598 align:middle line:84%
We just want to know
so people are set up

00:27:26.598 --> 00:27:29.057 align:middle line:84%
to know what to expect when
they ultimately read your book.

00:27:29.057 --> 00:27:29.856 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:27:29.856 --> 00:27:31.020 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's different.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.490 align:middle line:90%
Men are different from women.

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.930 align:middle line:90%
And people have different genes.

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:36.690 align:middle line:84%
So in the book, we
go to great lengths

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:38.610 align:middle line:84%
to really underscore
that there's

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:42.090 align:middle line:84%
no such thing as a one size
fits all dietary approach

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:44.080 align:middle line:90%
or supplement regimen.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:48.420 align:middle line:84%
So, we take the most
broadly applicable concepts.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And we also offer in
the book info boxes

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:52.950 align:middle line:84%
allowing you to
cater those concepts

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:54.880 align:middle line:90%
to your own unique biology.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.384 align:middle line:90%
Do you carry an APOE4 allele?

00:27:57.384 --> 00:27:59.550 align:middle line:84%
The recommendations might
not be all that different.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:01.950 align:middle line:84%
But if you did go
and do a gene test

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:04.900 align:middle line:84%
and you know that you carry
this gene, for example,

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.650 align:middle line:84%
you may want to consume more
extra virgin olive oil and less

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:10.710 align:middle line:90%
butter, according to the--

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Omega-9s
versus saturated fats.

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:16.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yes.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: According to
the best available evidence,

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:21.930 align:middle line:90%
which is constantly evolving.

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah,
so I mean, again--

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was a
fast evolving field.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.900 align:middle line:90%
It's really going right now.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Brain health, and understanding
dementia, and super foods.

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've interviewed so
many people in this area.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I just
had to say in there when

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:39.210 align:middle line:84%
people said, OK, bread
sounds suspiciously

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:40.720 align:middle line:90%
similar to Grain Brain.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And of course, David
Perlmutter is one of the people

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:46.830 align:middle line:84%
that you also look to in terms
of your research in that.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:52.054 align:middle line:84%
So let's start going into the
actual spectrum of nutrients

00:28:52.054 --> 00:28:53.970 align:middle line:84%
and how they affect the
brain from what you've

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:56.220 align:middle line:84%
learned thus far, and
what you feel science

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.922 align:middle line:90%
has discovered thus far.

00:28:57.922 --> 00:28:59.130 align:middle line:90%
And why don't we start there?

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:00.180 align:middle line:90%
Let's go with grains.

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.650 align:middle line:84%
You already mentioned
it a little bit ago.

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:04.025 align:middle line:84%
And then, I do want to get to
Dave Asprey, whom I've also

00:29:04.025 --> 00:29:07.310 align:middle line:84%
interviewed, in Bulletproofing
Coffee in the whole set up

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:09.940 align:middle line:84%
to because that show was popular
because people were like,

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:12.420 align:middle line:84%
yoo hoo, I can drink three,
or four, or five cups a day

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:15.060 align:middle line:84%
now as long as I put my
butter in it, you know,

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and what you found
along that way

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:18.330 align:middle line:84%
because some people don't
do well with coffee.

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.162 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So, we'll get to him.

00:29:20.162 --> 00:29:21.870 align:middle line:84%
We'll get to a whole
bunch of these guys.

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with
Perlmutter, Grain Brain,

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.170 align:middle line:90%
which feeds into Bread Head.

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So, just on record, I
love David Perlmutter,

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and he has been an
incredible inspiration to me.

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:37.890 align:middle line:10%
I like to think that
my work has really

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:41.370 align:middle line:10%
evolved past the initial
ideas that I read about

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:43.290 align:middle line:10%
in Grain Brain and elsewhere.

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:46.290 align:middle line:10%
But you know, there is a lot
of truth still in that book.

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:49.710 align:middle line:84%
When you read statistics like
3/4 of US teens and adults are

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:53.940 align:middle line:84%
either diabetic or pre-diabetic
and that diabetes is something

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.540 align:middle line:90%
that develops over 10 years--

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:59.940 align:middle line:84%
it's not something that
just pops up overnight--

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.890 align:middle line:84%
you realize that
the recommendation

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:06.570 align:middle line:84%
to add more grains to
your diet is really wrong.

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:08.985 align:middle line:84%
It's essentially what
diabetes and pre-diabetes is,

00:30:08.985 --> 00:30:11.610 align:middle line:90%
is carbohydrate intolerance.

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Did your research take
you to Mark's Daily Apple,

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:16.140 align:middle line:90%
by any chance?

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:16.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:17.975 align:middle line:90%
I love Mark Sisson.

00:30:17.975 --> 00:30:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And he's got one of the
best blogs on the internet.

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:20.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.890 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just bringing that up now
because as people are watching

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:25.348 align:middle line:84%
this, they can start writing
down all these different sites

00:30:25.348 --> 00:30:27.450 align:middle line:84%
as well because that
turned out to be really

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:30.440 align:middle line:84%
critical in curing diabetes is
they went to a classic paleo.

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.190 align:middle line:84%
They didn't go-- a lot
of them-- as far as

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.560 align:middle line:84%
ketogenic but kind of
a classic paleo diet,

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.090 align:middle line:90%
and just cut out the grains.

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Just that one thing.

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:37.930 align:middle line:90%
Grains and sugar.

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was amazing
how they were turning

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.100 align:middle line:90%
their own diabetes around.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:41.355 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:30:41.355 --> 00:30:43.425 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And leaving their
doctors scratching their heads.

00:30:43.425 --> 00:30:44.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah, exactly.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.670 align:middle line:84%
If you're diabetic, you're,
again, carbohydrate intolerant.

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And grains are highly
concentrated sources

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:54.780 align:middle line:84%
of carbohydrate with
minimal nutrients, you know.

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:57.870 align:middle line:10%
We talk about nutrient
density, how nutrient density

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:01.425 align:middle line:10%
should really be one of the
cornerstones of your diet

00:31:01.425 --> 00:31:04.432 align:middle line:10%
of the choices that you make
when it comes to what you're

00:31:04.432 --> 00:31:05.640 align:middle line:10%
going to put into your mouth.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.280 align:middle line:84%
You want foods that are
dense in nutrients, right.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.830 align:middle line:90%
Grains are nutrient poor.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And today when less
and less people

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.770 align:middle line:84%
practice recreational physical
activity than ever before,

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:18.510 align:middle line:90%
we're eating too many carbs.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is particularly
problematic for vegans

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.490 align:middle line:84%
because, oftentimes,
the argument

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:26.905 align:middle line:84%
for the b-vitamins spectrum,
say, in rice, for example,

00:31:26.905 --> 00:31:27.905 align:middle line:90%
comes into the equation.

00:31:27.905 --> 00:31:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a lot of
rice is consumed, often,

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:32.010 align:middle line:90%
in a vegan diet.

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:35.610 align:middle line:84%
How, for example,
do you guide people

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:37.465 align:middle line:84%
that fall into the
category of veganism?

00:31:37.465 --> 00:31:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:42.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that veganism
is an optimal diet for brain

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.540 align:middle line:90%
health and brain function.

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.610 align:middle line:84%
According to your
moral constitution,

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:49.950 align:middle line:84%
it might be the
right choice for you.

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And I struggle
with that, as well.

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.960 align:middle line:84%
But it's important to
divorce those conversations

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:55.760 align:middle line:90%
from one another.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.301 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like
church and state.

00:31:57.301 --> 00:31:59.580 align:middle line:90%


00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.227 align:middle line:84%
Our brains evolved with
diets that were omnivorous.

00:32:02.227 --> 00:32:03.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, researchers
believe that it's

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:09.390 align:middle line:84%
access to cooked meat, and
the pre-formed DHA and EPA

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:13.320 align:middle line:84%
fats in the fat of
those meat products

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.900 align:middle line:84%
that really catalyze the
growth of our brains.

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.180 align:middle line:90%
Fish oils.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, pasture
raised wild animals.

00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:21.900 align:middle line:90%
Things like that.

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And you know, a vegan
might say, well, I'm

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:29.520 align:middle line:84%
supplementing with B-12, which
is the one essential nutrient

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.335 align:middle line:84%
that we know that
we need that only

00:32:31.335 --> 00:32:32.460 align:middle line:90%
comes from animal products.

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And they might take
their B-12 supplement

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and think that they're
really checking all the boxes

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.330 align:middle line:90%
for nutrient deficiencies.

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:43.950 align:middle line:84%
But you know, there's
a whole category

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:46.140 align:middle line:84%
of nutrients that are
not essential but are

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:48.510 align:middle line:90%
called conditionally essential.

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And these nutrients are things
that we might manufacture

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:54.180 align:middle line:84%
to limited degrees
in our own bodies,

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.430 align:middle line:84%
but not nearly enough
for good health.

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:59.820 align:middle line:84%
So one example of that would
be a nutrient in red meat

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:01.380 align:middle line:90%
called creatine.

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:04.460 align:middle line:10%
Creatine was found to actually
boost the cognitive function,

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:07.650 align:middle line:10%
the ability of the
brain to think properly,

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:11.074 align:middle line:10%
when vegetarians
supplemented with it.

00:33:11.074 --> 00:33:13.240 align:middle line:84%
So you know, people that
are watching might be like,

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.156 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, now I'm going
to go and buy creatine

00:33:15.156 --> 00:33:15.960 align:middle line:90%
on the internet.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.570 align:middle line:84%
But this is just one
nutrient that we know of

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:20.640 align:middle line:84%
and that some
researcher somewhere was

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.870 align:middle line:90%
able to find funding to study.

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:29.550 align:middle line:84%
So the really impetus that
I have is to, sort of,

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:34.920 align:middle line:84%
tell people that when we cross
out an entire category of food

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:39.120 align:middle line:84%
that we surely have had for the
vast majority of the evolution

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:44.010 align:middle line:84%
of our brains, you're
really setting yourself up

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:47.420 align:middle line:90%
for reduced cognitive function.

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is difficult.
It's a very difficult subject.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And the most, I'd
say, the greatest

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:59.160 align:middle line:84%
preponderance of challenging
comments I get on my shows

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.890 align:middle line:84%
is if you go up against
veganism because I

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:04.410 align:middle line:84%
was a vegetarian for years,
had a vegetarian cooking show

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:06.900 align:middle line:84%
on PBS, wrote
vegetarian cookbooks

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:09.000 align:middle line:90%
until I became actually ill.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And then, couldn't
recover myself.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And I was constantly
chronically low on all the B

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:16.350 align:middle line:84%
vitamins and all of
that, even though I

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:17.852 align:middle line:90%
was taking supplementation.

00:34:17.852 --> 00:34:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, I went
through my own journey.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think the one
thing that, ultimately,

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:27.300 align:middle line:84%
I began understanding just from
more of a substantive point

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:31.469 align:middle line:84%
of view is that in
eating those things--

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:32.969 align:middle line:84%
whether it's fish
eating plankton,

00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:36.300 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's a
cattle grazing--

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:40.260 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about nutrient
condensation in a way

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.050 align:middle line:84%
that we can't and haven't yet
learned how to manufacture

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:44.370 align:middle line:90%
in the laboratory.

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:48.540 align:middle line:84%
There's no more bio available
source of iron than red meat.

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.879 align:middle line:84%
And pre-menopausal women need
twice as much iron than men.

00:34:51.879 --> 00:34:52.679 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:53.429 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: And
there's no better--

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I wasn't
eating any red meat

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:56.760 align:middle line:90%
during any of those years.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.426 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: And my
mom was a vegetarian.

00:34:58.426 --> 00:35:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
that her meat avoidance

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.440 align:middle line:90%
is what caused her dementia.

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.500 align:middle line:84%
But it certainly
did not protect her.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's really interesting
research, actually.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:11.070 align:middle line:84%
So most of the meat consumed
in the United States

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:13.110 align:middle line:90%
is of horrible quality.

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:15.776 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: It's
animals that are raised

00:35:15.776 --> 00:35:17.420 align:middle line:90%
in deplorable conditions.

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:20.580 align:middle line:84%
It's an animal Auschwitz
every single day.

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.100 align:middle line:90%
And I, in no way, endorse--

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is why
I quit all of that.

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: The factory
farming system, yeah.

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.252 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:26.252 --> 00:35:28.530 align:middle line:10%
>>LUGAVERE: In
Australia, there is

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:31.140 align:middle line:10%
a center at Deakin
University called

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:32.490 align:middle line:10%
the Food and Mood Center.

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:36.000 align:middle line:10%
And I've interviewed one of the
main researchers there named

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.260 align:middle line:10%
Felice Jacka.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.970 align:middle line:10%
In Australia, people
tend to consume meat

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:41.990 align:middle line:10%
from New Zealand, which
is, by default, grass fed.

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Grass fed, yeah.

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: And she
found that women

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:47.070 align:middle line:84%
that didn't consume
the recommended

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:49.320 align:middle line:84%
three to four servings
of red meat per week

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.840 align:middle line:84%
were twice as likely
to be depressed.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And she also found that
women who consumed more

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:56.220 align:middle line:84%
than the recommended
amount were also

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:57.670 align:middle line:90%
more likely to be depressed.

00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: So the idea,
really, behind this research

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.840 align:middle line:84%
is that some is better than
none, and too much is not great

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:05.640 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:08.691 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: So, I'm not saying
to base your diet around meat.

00:36:08.691 --> 00:36:11.850 align:middle line:84%
But I think that allowing
yourself to really eat

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:13.160 align:middle line:90%
and nourish your brain cells--

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well and also, a
body will often tell you--

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:17.460 align:middle line:90%
your own body will tell you--

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.920 align:middle line:84%
what it's desiring,
what it needs.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to, especially
if you're really, kind of,

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.580 align:middle line:84%
righteously
philosophical as I have

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:29.300 align:middle line:84%
been on many topics,
including vegetarianism,

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:32.060 align:middle line:84%
you will override what your
body is trying to tell you.

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a big
part of this message too.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And that also includes
carbohydrates.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.200 align:middle line:84%
There are times when your
brain, for whatever reason,

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:42.380 align:middle line:84%
is craving a shot
of carbohydrates.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.940 align:middle line:90%
And you should probably listen.

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do it in
the healthiest way you

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:48.770 align:middle line:90%
can, but listen in that moment.

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that,
more than anything,

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:54.660 align:middle line:84%
is rather than listening to our
philosophical learned overviews

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.460 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Listening to the body itself has
to be critical to this message.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:36:59.280 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.944 align:middle line:84%
We have a moral
luxury today to say

00:37:00.944 --> 00:37:02.735 align:middle line:84%
that we're not going
to eat meat because we

00:37:02.735 --> 00:37:03.800 align:middle line:90%
can supplement with B-12.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And we can make it at a certain
point without these nutrients

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:09.502 align:middle line:90%
and without this food.

00:37:09.502 --> 00:37:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some
people do beautifully.

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:12.380 align:middle line:90%
People can do it.

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: People can do it.

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you have
to look in the mirror.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.590 align:middle line:90%
You have to look inside.

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:18.253 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and there
are perfect examples

00:37:18.253 --> 00:37:20.450 align:middle line:84%
of people that seem to be
thriving on vegan diets.

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Like, Rich Roll,
for example, who's

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:25.190 align:middle line:84%
a vegan ultra-marathoner
who is in amazing shape.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:27.590 align:middle line:10%
I wish I was in as
good a physical shape

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:29.706 align:middle line:10%
as he seems to be in.

00:37:29.706 --> 00:37:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wayne
Lightheart, yeah.

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:34.070 align:middle line:84%
But for most people, I
think it's really difficult.

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think, again, making the
argument purely about health

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:43.400 align:middle line:84%
really is something that I
think is important to do.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I agree.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.770 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about gluten.

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:49.290 align:middle line:84%
OK, so Perlmutter
would say, essentially,

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:53.750 align:middle line:84%
that the gluten in the grain
is also seriously implicated

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:54.810 align:middle line:90%
in Alzheimer's.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:55.610 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:57.860 align:middle line:84%
There is very little
evidence to make

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:00.980 align:middle line:84%
a direct connection between
gluten and Alzheimer's disease.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:02.282 align:middle line:90%
Very little evidence.

00:38:02.282 --> 00:38:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the things that I

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.180 align:middle line:90%
learned early on in my journey.

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:10.670 align:middle line:84%
But there is an impact of gluten
on the gut lining of everybody.

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to be more
exacerbated in the context.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:17.540 align:middle line:84%
I.e., it seems to be a more
extreme impact on the gut

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:20.840 align:middle line:84%
lining of people in the context
of the Western diet, which

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.630 align:middle line:84%
is very low in fiber,
low in vegetables,

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:28.460 align:middle line:84%
and full of industrial products
used to make processed foods.

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Genetically modified.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:33.077 align:middle line:84%
You have actual gluten added to
the products, the baked goods.

00:38:33.077 --> 00:38:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah, exactly.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Extra gluten.

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:35.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Exactly.

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:37.860 align:middle line:84%
So we're eating more gluten
than ever before, this protein

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.490 align:middle line:84%
that no human can
properly digest.

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:41.990 align:middle line:10%
And we're eating
it in the context

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:46.280 align:middle line:10%
of a diet that is leaving our
gut bacteria pretty unhappy

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.990 align:middle line:10%
because they're not getting
the fuel that they need,

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:50.300 align:middle line:10%
which is fiber.

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So, after having
just said all that

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:56.120 align:middle line:84%
about the value of a little
bit of red meat in the diet,

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.130 align:middle line:84%
I now want to
underscore how important

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:01.640 align:middle line:84%
eating lots of
vegetables is because we

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.350 align:middle line:84%
have a universe
of microorganisms

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:06.650 align:middle line:84%
that live in our large
intestine, the colon.

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:09.444 align:middle line:84%
And they find it to be the
Boca Raton of the human body.

00:39:09.444 --> 00:39:10.610 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they hang out there.

00:39:10.610 --> 00:39:12.470 align:middle line:90%
They luxuriate.

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:14.660 align:middle line:84%
They basically get
what is undigested

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:17.300 align:middle line:84%
by the small intestine,
which is fiber,

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.040 align:middle line:84%
which comes from dark,
leafy greens, vegetables,

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.300 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Cruciferous
vegetables, in particular.

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: Cruciferous
vegetables, in particular.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.080 align:middle line:90%
Avocados.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.150 align:middle line:84%
An avocado has 12
grams of dietary fiber.

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:30.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who needs
Wheat Bran when

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:32.876 align:middle line:84%
you can eat a whole avocado,
which also provides you

00:39:32.876 --> 00:39:35.340 align:middle line:84%
with so many other
nutrients that we need?

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:38.960 align:middle line:84%
So, what's so cool, and
we go really in-depth

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:43.020 align:middle line:84%
into this ingenious foods
about these microbes,

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:46.250 align:middle line:84%
is that they basically
ferment the dietary fiber

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:47.390 align:middle line:90%
that we feed them.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And they create these
chemicals, these really powerful

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:52.430 align:middle line:84%
chemicals, called short
chain fatty acids.

00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:55.400 align:middle line:84%
The most well-studied of
which is called butyrate.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And basically, the cells
of our colons eat butyrate.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.480 align:middle line:84%
So these bacteria
literally feed the cells

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:07.662 align:middle line:84%
of our colon, which,
in turn, produce mucus.

00:40:07.662 --> 00:40:08.870 align:middle line:90%
Now this sounds really gross.

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:12.680 align:middle line:84%
But this mucous lining
that colonic cells make

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:16.340 align:middle line:84%
is really important
to preventing

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:20.210 align:middle line:84%
a breakdown of our gut
lining and from preventing

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:24.374 align:middle line:84%
an inflammatory response
to things like gluten.

00:40:24.374 --> 00:40:25.790 align:middle line:84%
So when we're
eating a diet that's

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:30.270 align:middle line:84%
really high in vegetables,
really high in dietary fiber,

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:34.160 align:middle line:84%
it may give our guts a
little bit more resilience

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.800 align:middle line:84%
against things that
people seem to be

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.490 align:middle line:90%
really sensitive to today.

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:41.380 align:middle line:84%
I.e, gluten and lectins,
which have been in the news.

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I'm
going to ask you

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:43.910 align:middle line:90%
about that in a minute, yeah.

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
and in short chain

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:48.950 align:middle line:84%
fatty acids, other
complexes you can

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:52.040 align:middle line:84%
take to offset that are things
like kombucha, apple cider

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:52.910 align:middle line:90%
vinegar.

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:55.877 align:middle line:84%
These also fit into that same
short chain fatty acid complex.

00:40:55.877 --> 00:40:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah, exactly.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.772 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
can help reverse.

00:40:58.772 --> 00:41:00.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're
going to have a--

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.563 align:middle line:84%
you know, whoopee, I want to
have a muffin this morning,

00:41:02.563 --> 00:41:04.630 align:middle line:84%
maybe have your apple
cider vinegar first.

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:07.326 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, things
like that to start off setting.

00:41:07.326 --> 00:41:10.451 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you're saying
more or less that you can?

00:41:10.451 --> 00:41:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: Exactly, that we
can build resilience in the gut

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:15.270 align:middle line:84%
through consuming
kombucha probiotics.

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:16.400 align:middle line:90%
I love kombucha.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.775 align:middle line:84%
Since I've been in Boulder,
I've had some local kombucha,

00:41:18.775 --> 00:41:20.360 align:middle line:90%
which is amazing.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:22.360 align:middle line:90%
And eating more vegetables.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.260 align:middle line:90%
Eating dietary fiber.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:26.200 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, what
we want in a nutshell

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:30.130 align:middle line:84%
is the microbiome of
a grain free vegan

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:31.780 align:middle line:90%
who eats a little bit of meat.

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:34.079 align:middle line:84%
You know, we don't want
the microbiome of somebody

00:41:34.079 --> 00:41:36.370 align:middle line:84%
who eats a lot of meat with
a little bit of vegetables.

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:37.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: We want the
microbiome of grain free vegan

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:40.150 align:middle line:90%
that it's meat.

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, which
makes perfect sense.

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's, essentially,
with Mark's Daily Apple,

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:44.950 align:middle line:90%
a lot of people say, oh, paleo.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:46.000 align:middle line:90%
This is terrible.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.344 align:middle line:90%
It's so much meat and fat.

00:41:47.344 --> 00:41:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And some diets-- and we're
going to go into it next,

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:50.610 align:middle line:90%
ketogenic diets--

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:52.120 align:middle line:90%
do require a lot of fat.

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:55.480 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes, this is for
a more critical condition

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:57.465 align:middle line:84%
that the body has
found itself in.

00:41:57.465 --> 00:41:58.265 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:41:58.265 --> 00:41:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:00.035 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So,
let's go into that.

00:42:00.035 --> 00:42:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to-- I also interviewed
him, Dominic D'agostino, which

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:03.740 align:middle line:90%
whom we both admire.

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:04.540 align:middle line:10%
>>LUGAVERE: Yes.

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:07.730 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And the
subject of ketogenics.

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:08.530 align:middle line:10%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:11.380 align:middle line:84%
So a ketogenic diet
is basically a diet

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:14.680 align:middle line:84%
that allows your body
to tap into its own fat

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:15.966 align:middle line:90%
as a source of fuel.

00:42:15.966 --> 00:42:17.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To burn
fat instead of sugar.

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:19.960 align:middle line:10%
>>LUGAVERE: To burn fat
instead of sugar, yes.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:22.510 align:middle line:10%
And it's something that
our bodies are actually

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:25.000 align:middle line:10%
quite familiar with because
we came into the world

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.380 align:middle line:10%
as babies spending a lot of
time in this ketogenic state

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:33.200 align:middle line:10%
where our brains were
burning fat instead of sugar.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Today, we chronically
deny our brains

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:41.970 align:middle line:84%
the ability to burn fat,
which is actually a very

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:43.950 align:middle line:90%
clean burning fuel source.

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is because our
bodies and our brains

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:49.560 align:middle line:84%
want to burn what we feed them
the most frequently, which

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.134 align:middle line:84%
tends to be sugar,
and carbs, and grains.

00:42:53.134 --> 00:42:54.425 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All results in sugar.

00:42:54.425 --> 00:42:56.175 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: Exactly,
which below the neck,

00:42:56.175 --> 00:42:57.490 align:middle line:90%
is all the same thing.

00:42:57.490 --> 00:42:58.530 align:middle line:90%
It's all sugar.

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Either they're single
molecules of sugar,

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:01.590 align:middle line:90%
or they're chains of sugar.

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:03.270 align:middle line:84%
They break down
instantly, even as soon

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:04.920 align:middle line:90%
as you start chewing the starch.

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:08.820 align:middle line:84%
If you allow a piece of white
rice to linger on your tongue,

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:11.160 align:middle line:84%
white rice isn't sweet,
but within a few seconds,

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.200 align:middle line:84%
it'll start to taste
sweet because that's

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:16.020 align:middle line:84%
because of the amylase enzyme
that we have in our saliva that

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.400 align:middle line:90%
breaks down starch immediately.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:23.250 align:middle line:84%
So, when we go on a diet
that's lower in carbohydrates,

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:25.140 align:middle line:84%
and especially when
we allow ourselves

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:28.050 align:middle line:84%
to fast occasionally
to practice something

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:32.190 align:middle line:84%
called intermittent fasting, we
allow our bodies and our brains

00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:37.290 align:middle line:84%
to tap into our fat, which
the brain will happily

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:39.030 align:middle line:90%
burn for fuel.

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:41.970 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, these ketones--

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:44.370 align:middle line:84%
and Dominic D'agostino
is so eloquent

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and articulate in
his description.

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Watch the
interview with Dominic.

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:49.260 align:middle line:90%
You'll like it.

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:50.468 align:middle line:10%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah, he's great.

00:43:50.468 --> 00:43:54.480 align:middle line:10%
I'm merely a curator of
a lot of the information

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:57.790 align:middle line:10%
that he's actually published
in my medical literature

00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:58.590 align:middle line:10%
and others.

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:00.716 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's in
the archives here.

00:44:00.716 --> 00:44:01.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:03.030 align:middle line:90%
The brain loves to burn ketones.

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's some evidence that
a brain with Alzheimer's disease

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:12.720 align:middle line:84%
actually has lost its
ability to metabolize sugar.

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And so, by denying it the
ability to burn ketones as fat

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:19.860 align:middle line:84%
actually perpetuates
the disease process.

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.780 align:middle line:90%
OK, so now we go to lectins.

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:27.120 align:middle line:10%
And Dr. Gundry,
right now, is kind

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:29.760 align:middle line:10%
of the poster boy for the
lectin story at the moment.

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:30.655 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yes.

00:44:30.655 --> 00:44:32.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about what lectins

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.830 align:middle line:84%
are, what the prevailing
story at the moment is,

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and what your
research has found.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah, so
lectins are plant proteins

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:42.300 align:middle line:84%
that are, basically, like the
defense proteins in plants

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:44.160 align:middle line:84%
that, when an animal
would consume them,

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:49.020 align:middle line:84%
it would inflame them through
its impact on the gut.

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Lectins are common in
nightshades, tomatoes, peppers,

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:53.910 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And particularly,
the seeds and the skin, right?

00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yes.

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not so much the flesh.

00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yes.

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I found that
kind of interesting.

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:01.881 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: But the
problem is many lectins

00:45:01.881 --> 00:45:04.800 align:middle line:84%
are actually deactivated
through the cooking process.

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And we tend not to eat seeds
of things like bell peppers

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:09.390 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:15.150 align:middle line:84%
But also, we want to be as
robust an organism as we can.

00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And some of the most
important compounds

00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:20.370 align:middle line:84%
that we consume when we
eat vegetables are actually

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:24.300 align:middle line:84%
in a similar category of
being plant defense compounds.

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:29.700 align:middle line:84%
So polyphenols are
very common in plants.

00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:32.070 align:middle line:10%
They're one of the reasons
why extra virgin olive oil is

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:34.050 align:middle line:10%
so good for.

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Blueberries, dark chocolate,
are rich in polyphenols.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Polyphenols are actually good
for us because, in a way,

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:40.740 align:middle line:90%
they're bad for us.

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:45.810 align:middle line:84%
They actually stimulate our
body's own antioxidant defense

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:47.220 align:middle line:90%
chemicals.

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.140 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I
think if we're going

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.870 align:middle line:84%
to have a conversation
about plant products

00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:54.240 align:middle line:90%
that are not good for us--

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, polyphenols are,
technically, not good for us.

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:59.340 align:middle line:84%
In really high amounts,
they may be toxic.

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:01.770 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, in small amounts,
they compel our bodies

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:03.120 align:middle line:90%
to adapt and grow stronger.

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Almost
like an immunization.

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:10.230 align:middle line:84%
I think for somebody with an
active autoimmune disease,

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:13.350 align:middle line:90%
it's worth eliminating lectins.

00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:16.890 align:middle line:84%
But again, for most people, I
think a lot of the sensitivity

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:19.020 align:middle line:84%
that clinicians see
is due to the fact

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:21.810 align:middle line:84%
that we've ultimately lost
resilience in the gut.

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:23.850 align:middle line:84%
We're not eating
enough dietary fiber

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:27.780 align:middle line:84%
allowing these compounds
to get closer and closer

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:32.280 align:middle line:90%
to our own immune system.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that really
shouldn't be the case if we're

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:38.665 align:middle line:84%
eating lots of fiber, and
we have a robust microbiome

00:46:38.665 --> 00:46:43.650 align:middle line:90%
and a robust mucus layer.

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:46.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do I eat foods
that contain lectins?

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.592 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I eat tomatoes,
and I eat bell peppers

00:46:48.592 --> 00:46:50.966 align:middle line:84%
because I think the benefits
probably outweigh the risks.

00:46:50.966 --> 00:46:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
essential fatty acids.

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.075 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the sourcing
of essential fatty

00:46:57.075 --> 00:47:01.530 align:middle line:84%
acids, whether it be Udo's
oil, which is all vegan based,

00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:04.560 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's a
Nordic fish oil.

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
quality, the effectiveness,

00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:08.640 align:middle line:90%
and what you've learned.

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:15.180 align:middle line:10%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah, so
omega 3s and omega 6s

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:16.605 align:middle line:10%
are essential fatty acids.

00:47:16.605 --> 00:47:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And they're essential because we
don't make them in our bodies.

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:21.870 align:middle line:90%
We have to get them from food.

00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:24.180 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that you
have to eat a lot of them.

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:27.870 align:middle line:84%
That just means that we need to
get some so that our brains can

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:30.130 align:middle line:84%
use them as building
blocks, and so

00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:32.130 align:middle line:84%
that we can have a healthy
inflammatory response

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:34.720 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:38.680 align:middle line:84%
The kinds of omega 3s that
are present in the diet

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:42.280 align:middle line:90%
are pre-formed EPA and DHA.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.280 align:middle line:90%
So EPA fat is anti-inflammatory.

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.380 align:middle line:84%
DHA is one of the most
important building

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:48.970 align:middle line:90%
blocks of a healthy brain.

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Those are found in the fat
of fatty fish, grass fed

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:55.640 align:middle line:84%
beef, pasteurized
eggs, things like that.

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:58.840 align:middle line:84%
The other omega 3 fat that
is pretty common in diet

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:00.490 align:middle line:90%
comes from plants.

00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:01.360 align:middle line:10%
Chia seeds.

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:02.350 align:middle line:10%
Flaxseeds.

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:03.910 align:middle line:10%
Walnuts.

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:06.640 align:middle line:10%
The problem is that
humans are very

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:11.470 align:middle line:10%
poor at converting
the omega 3 fats found

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:15.160 align:middle line:10%
in plants to their
usable forms in the body.

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Women are about twice
as good at it as men.

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:22.150 align:middle line:84%
But your average
dude can eat lots

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:25.930 align:middle line:84%
of plant based omega
3s in the form of ALA,

00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:30.940 align:middle line:84%
and see a negligible increase
in DHA and EPA in their bodies.

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:33.328 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: It's
thought that women

00:48:33.328 --> 00:48:37.750 align:middle line:84%
are better at this conversion
to facilitate childbearing.

00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:42.370 align:middle line:84%
But in general, what you
want are pre-formed fat.

00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:46.810 align:middle line:84%
So if you are vegan, algal oil
I think is a good substitute.

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:50.080 align:middle line:84%
But in general, I try
to eat fatty fish two

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.340 align:middle line:90%
to three times per week.

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:54.450 align:middle line:84%
I supplement with
high quality fish oil.

00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And I also avoid
grain and seed oils,

00:48:57.730 --> 00:49:01.150 align:middle line:84%
like canola, corn, and
soy oil because they

00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:03.140 align:middle line:90%
can pervert the balance.

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:03.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:07.420 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and a lot of those also
start skewing, like safflower.

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
common oil starts

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:11.740 align:middle line:84%
skewing the balance
between the 6s and the 3s

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:13.330 align:middle line:90%
where you're overloaded in 6s.

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:16.930 align:middle line:84%
If you eat a lot of baked goods
that are commercially made,

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:20.490 align:middle line:84%
you're getting a ton of omega
6s out of balance to the 3s.

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:26.244 align:middle line:84%
So this kind of fat is
called polyunsaturated fats.

00:49:26.244 --> 00:49:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And they were really
present in the diet

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:31.810 align:middle line:84%
and trace quantities for the
vast majority of our evolution

00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:33.261 align:middle line:90%
up until about 100 years ago.

00:49:33.261 --> 00:49:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And now they make up 10%
to 20% of our calories.

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: In the
form of canola oil,

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:40.900 align:middle line:90%
corn oil, and things like that.

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So these fats are really
important for the brain.

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, again,
omega 6's are not bad.

00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:47.290 align:middle line:90%
They're essential.

00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:49.491 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: And a
healthy human brain

00:49:49.491 --> 00:49:52.650 align:middle line:90%
has both omega 3s and omega 6s.

00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It has to be in
the right proportion though.

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah, in a
comparable proportion.

00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:58.085 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE:
Interestingly, if you

00:49:58.085 --> 00:50:01.030 align:middle line:84%
take the polyunsaturated fat
content of a piece of grass fed

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:03.880 align:middle line:84%
beef, it mirrors that of
a healthy human brain.

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:07.950 align:middle line:10%
Another piece we
haven't talked about--

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:09.880 align:middle line:10%
this is just, kind
of, a quickie note,

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:13.370 align:middle line:10%
is choline content in
egg yolks, for example,

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:16.730 align:middle line:10%
which is really an essential
nutrient to the brain in brain

00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:17.530 align:middle line:10%
function.

00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Exactly.

00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So before, we were talking
about nutrients that

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:21.760 align:middle line:90%
are conditionally essential.

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Choline, as you mentioned,
is the perfect example

00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:26.489 align:middle line:84%
of a conditionally
essential amino acids.

00:50:26.489 --> 00:50:28.030 align:middle line:84%
So what that means,
again, is that we

00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:30.160 align:middle line:84%
make a little bit of
choline in our bodies,

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.540 align:middle line:90%
but not enough for good health.

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: And most
people consume not

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:37.540 align:middle line:84%
nearly enough choline, which
is abundant in egg yolk.

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:40.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, an egg yolk provides
your daily requirement

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:40.810 align:middle line:90%
for choline.

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, you'd need
to eat, I think,

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:44.260 align:middle line:84%
something like five
cups of brussels

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:47.170 align:middle line:84%
sprouts every single day to
get the same amount of choline

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:48.220 align:middle line:90%
as found in one egg yolk.

00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, that
condensation of nutrients.

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah

00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:53.883 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: And colon is
really important as a precursor

00:50:53.883 --> 00:50:57.040 align:middle line:84%
to acetylcholine, which is
a neurotransmitter that's

00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.820 align:middle line:84%
really important in
learning and memory.

00:50:58.820 --> 00:50:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:01.911 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: In fact, patients
with Alzheimer's disease,

00:51:01.911 --> 00:51:03.880 align:middle line:84%
or any kind of
dementia really, take

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.084 align:middle line:84%
drugs to boost levels of
acetylcholine in the brain.

00:51:06.084 --> 00:51:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
an egg for breakfast,

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:12.177 align:middle line:84%
ideally, where the yolk is not
cooked and the white is cooked.

00:51:12.177 --> 00:51:13.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a soft-boiled
egg is, kind of,

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.917 align:middle line:84%
your classic for the
best consumption of that.

00:51:15.917 --> 00:51:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Exactly.

00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:17.550 --> 00:51:22.529 align:middle line:84%
OK, we already talked about
probiotics a little bit ago.

00:51:22.529 --> 00:51:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked about
protein consumption.

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:27.260 align:middle line:84%
I want to go into the whole
bullet proof story in coffee.

00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.631 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a fan of coffee.

00:51:30.631 --> 00:51:31.630 align:middle line:10%
I'm a big fan of coffee.

00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:34.420 align:middle line:10%
And the research really seems
to show that it's protective.

00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:35.860 align:middle line:10%
It's anti-inflammatory.

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:37.965 align:middle line:10%
It's America's number one
source of polyphenols,

00:51:37.965 --> 00:51:40.340 align:middle line:10%
these little compounds that
actually tell our bodies to--

00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:42.370 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But like you say, you
can have only so many of those

00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:43.780 align:middle line:10%
before you start tipping over.

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:44.065 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:51:44.065 --> 00:51:45.023 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Well, yeah.

00:51:45.023 --> 00:51:47.980 align:middle line:84%
So, there is person-to-person
variability in our ability

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:49.240 align:middle line:90%
to metabolize caffeine.

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:51.943 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: Generally,
you want to make sure

00:51:51.943 --> 00:51:56.290 align:middle line:84%
that you're consuming coffee
before 2:00 PM, maybe 3:00 PM,

00:51:56.290 --> 00:51:58.900 align:middle line:90%
so as not to affect your sleep.

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:02.740 align:middle line:84%
But there is pretty
good evidence

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:05.710 align:middle line:84%
to suggest that coffee is
protective against, both,

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Parkinson's disease and
Alzheimer's disease.

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it is interesting
when you're bringing it up.

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:11.814 align:middle line:84%
That way you're looking,
again, if we go back

00:52:11.814 --> 00:52:12.900 align:middle line:90%
to metabolic typing.

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:52:13.210 --> 00:52:14.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:16.260 align:middle line:90%


00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:20.450 align:middle line:10%
The general rule of thumb is
if a slow metabolizer, which

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:25.590 align:middle line:10%
are more comfortable with a
vegan or vegetarian any way

00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:29.220 align:middle line:10%
diet, which need lower
proteins and lower fats,

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:32.310 align:middle line:10%
and more vegetables
and carbohydrates,

00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:36.180 align:middle line:10%
can consume coffee just
straight up a little bit more

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:38.310 align:middle line:10%
effectively without any
detrimental effects.

00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, a fast metabolizer that
needs more fats and proteins

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:44.460 align:middle line:84%
in their diet needs the
accompaniment of even heavy

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:46.770 align:middle line:84%
cream, which is a big part
of that story with Dave

00:52:46.770 --> 00:52:48.690 align:middle line:84%
[? Asbury ? ] is
butter, in fact.

00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Heavy cream to ameliorate
some of the insulin producing

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:53.520 align:middle line:90%
effects of it and can do it OK.

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.160 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's all in balance
and so highly individual.

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:52:57.050 --> 00:52:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:52:57.350 --> 00:52:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, adding
fat to your coffee

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:00.960 align:middle line:84%
is going to slow the
release of caffeine.

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: Adding
fat to anything

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:05.130 align:middle line:84%
slows gastric emptying,
which is basically

00:53:05.130 --> 00:53:07.857 align:middle line:84%
the emptying of the
contents of your stomach

00:53:07.857 --> 00:53:08.940 align:middle line:90%
into your small intestine.

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: So, any time
you add fat to something,

00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:12.540 align:middle line:84%
that process is going
to become slower.

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:15.039 align:middle line:84%
And that can make for a more
pleasant coffee drinking

00:53:15.039 --> 00:53:17.205 align:middle line:84%
experience because you don't
get the caffeine surge.

00:53:17.205 --> 00:53:21.460 align:middle line:90%


00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:24.600 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of
respect for Dave.

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:27.990 align:middle line:90%
I use MCT oil.

00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:30.450 align:middle line:84%
He has a product that's
similar to MCT oil called

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:31.980 align:middle line:84%
brain octane, which
I use which is

00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:34.040 align:middle line:84%
part of the bulletproof
coffee concoction.

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:34.310 --> 00:53:35.893 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: I don't
think that there's

00:53:35.893 --> 00:53:40.200 align:middle line:84%
any necessity for adding
more butter to the diet.

00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.840 align:middle line:84%
That said, I do enjoy
bulletproof coffee,

00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:44.610 align:middle line:90%
and I will drink it.

00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:48.630 align:middle line:84%
But I don't make the
recommendation to people

00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:51.840 align:middle line:84%
to add more butter to their
diet necessarily because, again,

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:58.050 align:middle line:84%
going back to genes,
every nutrient is so--

00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:00.205 align:middle line:84%
whether or not it's good
for you or bad for you

00:54:00.205 --> 00:54:01.210 align:middle line:90%
is so context dependent.

00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:03.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: What
else are you eating?

00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:04.245 align:middle line:90%
What are your genes like?

00:54:04.245 --> 00:54:04.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:06.161 align:middle line:84%
And the quality of
the source itself.

00:54:06.161 --> 00:54:08.460 align:middle line:10%
So, if you go then swing
over to Dr. Mercola's side,

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:09.840 align:middle line:10%
he'll say, yeah, go for it.

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Drink coffee, but make sure
it doesn't have mold on it.

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:14.400 align:middle line:84%
So, his is the mold
free coffee story.

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:17.580 align:middle line:10%
Other people will say, no, shade
grown, organic, high altitude

00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:18.690 align:middle line:10%
coffee only.

00:54:18.690 --> 00:54:19.710 align:middle line:90%
Low acidic coffee.

00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:22.379 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has a
story, but every body

00:54:22.379 --> 00:54:24.420 align:middle line:84%
is going to respond to
these coffees differently.

00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:25.340 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Exactly.

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:26.520 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, that's like
the beautiful thing

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:28.103 align:middle line:84%
about the internet
is that there's now

00:54:28.103 --> 00:54:29.300 align:middle line:90%
this plurality of voices.

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there's a
lot of people who are like,

00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:32.753 align:middle line:84%
well, this worked
for me, so I'm going

00:54:32.753 --> 00:54:35.200 align:middle line:84%
to make it sound like it's
going to work for you.

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:38.160 align:middle line:84%
But I think my
passion really has

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:42.990 align:middle line:84%
been to help people
get to the truth,

00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:45.910 align:middle line:84%
and to help people realize
that everybody is different.

00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And there is a lot of truth
that's out there, you know.

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:48.145 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There is.

00:54:48.145 --> 00:54:48.610 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot.

00:54:48.610 --> 00:54:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
conflicting information.

00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And you have to start
developing discernment yourself.

00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:52.635 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:54:52.635 --> 00:54:54.968 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I wanted to add
one little thing because I

00:54:54.968 --> 00:54:57.180 align:middle line:84%
have a step mom
who is very, very

00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:59.430 align:middle line:90%
advanced in terms of dementia.

00:54:59.430 --> 00:55:02.036 align:middle line:84%
And now she doesn't really
know who any of us are.

00:55:02.036 --> 00:55:03.660 align:middle line:84%
She kind of remembers
who my father is.

00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:04.659 align:middle line:90%
And she's still at home.

00:55:04.659 --> 00:55:07.080 align:middle line:84%
He loves her dearly, and he
wants to take care of her

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:08.310 align:middle line:90%
as long as he can.

00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:11.220 align:middle line:84%
So there are locks up
high because she can jump

00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.480 align:middle line:90%
like a little spider monkey.

00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:16.410 align:middle line:84%
At 90 years old, she can
jump and unlock things.

00:55:16.410 --> 00:55:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Incredible physical health, but
the cognitive function is gone.

00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:24.284 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I've noticed
about her that I hadn't read

00:55:24.284 --> 00:55:26.700 align:middle line:84%
about anywhere, but I haven't
studied the subject like you

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:30.190 align:middle line:84%
have, is that when I would
come in, for example,

00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:33.600 align:middle line:84%
she doesn't know my name or who
I am, my identity any longer,

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:37.390 align:middle line:90%
but her field knows my energy.

00:55:37.390 --> 00:55:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And there is this
comfort and safety

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:41.700 align:middle line:84%
she experiences around
me and other people

00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:44.250 align:middle line:84%
that she's comfortable
with that goes

00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:46.830 align:middle line:84%
beyond any cognitive
recognition.

00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to bring
this up because it's never

00:55:49.070 --> 00:55:49.870 align:middle line:90%
talked about.

00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:51.210 align:middle line:90%
And I only noticed it recently.

00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:52.280 align:middle line:90%
I thought, what is it?

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, ah,
she can't remember me,

00:55:54.690 --> 00:55:56.580 align:middle line:90%
but she can feel me.

00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:58.954 align:middle line:84%
And she feels safe and
comfortable around me.

00:55:58.954 --> 00:56:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And when I get ready to
say goodbye and leave,

00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:02.970 align:middle line:84%
she starts to
panic a little bit.

00:56:02.970 --> 00:56:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Even though she
doesn't know who I am,

00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:05.920 align:middle line:90%
you know, trying to reach out.

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:08.470 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't want me to go
because she feels safe.

00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's
important for us to--

00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:13.320 align:middle line:84%
someone could make
a study of that one.

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:15.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's important to
remember, even if the memory

00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:19.780 align:middle line:84%
is not there, the familiarity
of people may well be there.

00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:22.413 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
connection may well still

00:56:22.413 --> 00:56:24.480 align:middle line:84%
be there, even when
it's reached it's,

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:26.710 align:middle line:84%
kind of, final-- till
the final stages, really.

00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Yeah.

00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, dementia's
a rough disease.

00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And you know, one
of my colleagues

00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:39.120 align:middle line:84%
who is a Alzheimer's prevention
researcher and neurologist,

00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:42.490 align:middle line:84%
he has this saying that he uses
that couldn't be more accurate.

00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Once you've seen one
case of dementia,

00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:45.950 align:middle line:84%
you've seen one
case of dementia.

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:46.070 --> 00:56:47.903 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: It's so
different for everybody.

00:56:47.903 --> 00:56:49.702 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For every person.

00:56:49.702 --> 00:56:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: And that
said, there's overlapping.

00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:53.880 align:middle line:84%
No matter what the
diagnosis is, there's

00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:56.330 align:middle line:84%
overlapping pathologies
with all of them.

00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:58.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
this amyloid plaque,

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.231 align:middle line:84%
which is so common in
Alzheimer's disease.

00:57:00.231 --> 00:57:01.646 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
defining features,

00:57:01.646 --> 00:57:03.150 align:middle line:84%
actually, of
Alzheimer's disease.

00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:05.235 align:middle line:84%
But it's also present in
people that are not demented.

00:57:05.235 --> 00:57:06.035 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:57:06.035 --> 00:57:08.732 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: And it's present in
Parkinson's disease, as well.

00:57:08.732 --> 00:57:10.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
don't understand

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:12.456 align:middle line:90%
Parkinson's at all yet.

00:57:12.456 --> 00:57:14.379 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: Exactly
So my focus really,

00:57:14.379 --> 00:57:16.670 align:middle line:84%
even though my mom was never
diagnosed with Alzheimer's

00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:19.280 align:middle line:84%
disease, I focused on
Alzheimer's disease

00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:21.920 align:middle line:84%
because it's the disease for
which the most research is

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:22.720 align:middle line:90%
available.

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How's she doing now?

00:57:24.130 --> 00:57:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: I mean,
she's doing all right.

00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:28.820 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want
to sugarcoat it.

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: It's horrible.

00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And every second that
I spend with her--

00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you
having influence

00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:34.294 align:middle line:90%
on her diet and everything?

00:57:34.294 --> 00:57:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: Well you know, I
try, but I'm not her caretaker.

00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:39.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Gotcha.

00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:43.700 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: And you
know, people that

00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:46.425 align:middle line:84%
develop Alzheimer's disease,
actually, their food

00:57:46.425 --> 00:57:47.225 align:middle line:90%
preferences change.

00:57:47.225 --> 00:57:48.025 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:48.025 --> 00:57:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: They
develop a sweet tooth.

00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: My step
mom lives on sugar.

00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Mm hm.

00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:54.594 align:middle line:90%
And why might that be?

00:57:54.594 --> 00:57:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It makes it worse.

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.884 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: It might be
because the brain is really

00:57:57.884 --> 00:57:58.910 align:middle line:90%
crying out for energy.

00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Energy.

00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: And
it only knows how

00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:03.615 align:middle line:84%
to use glucose at such
an advanced stage, right.

00:58:03.615 --> 00:58:04.415 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:58:04.415 --> 00:58:06.748 align:middle line:84%
>>LUGAVERE: But the ability
of the brain to use ketones,

00:58:06.748 --> 00:58:09.170 align:middle line:84%
which we talked about
before, is undeterred

00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:12.500 align:middle line:84%
by aging, by Alzheimer's
disease, and by genes.

00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:13.935 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:58:13.935 --> 00:58:17.420 align:middle line:10%
>>LUGAVERE: So actually, whereas
I think somebody who already

00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:20.420 align:middle line:10%
has developed dementia, it might
be really difficult to put them

00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:22.700 align:middle line:10%
on a ketogenic diet.

00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:25.430 align:middle line:10%
That's where I think the
application for something

00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:30.200 align:middle line:10%
like MCT oil may be
potentially useful because MCT

00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:32.780 align:middle line:10%
oil, basically,
allows your brain

00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:37.580 align:middle line:10%
to access ketones without
needing to be on a very

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:38.600 align:middle line:10%
low carbohydrate diet.

00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:40.760 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Well I wish you luck on that
journey, the personal journey,

00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:47.600 align:middle line:84%
and I wish you well in informing
your generation, my generation,

00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:50.725 align:middle line:84%
and everyone in between through
your own passion in this work.

00:58:50.725 --> 00:58:51.525 align:middle line:90%
Good job.

00:58:51.525 --> 00:58:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Thank you so much.

00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can't wait to see
it when the book finally

00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:54.400 align:middle line:90%
comes out.

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LUGAVERE: Thank you.

00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:58.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, the name
of the book, Genius Foods,

00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:00.080 align:middle line:10%
is available at
major booksellers.
