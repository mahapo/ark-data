00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.120 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Dr. John
Mack ventured his reputation

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.730 align:middle line:10%
while serving as head of
clinical psychology at Harvard

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.610 align:middle line:10%
to research the phenomena
of alien abduction.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.740 align:middle line:84%
He concluded that
there were far too

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.890 align:middle line:84%
many similar experiences
to dismiss it as fact.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Like Mack, Laurie McDonald
has devoted decades

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.420 align:middle line:84%
as a hypnotherapist
to uncovering

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.580 align:middle line:84%
what lies in the
subconscious of people

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.350 align:middle line:84%
who believe they've had these
experiences, and she's with us

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.150 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.710 align:middle line:90%
And what a tale we have.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Your own personal tale,
just to start out, is wild.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.880 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Laurie.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LAURIE MCDONALD: Thank you.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.460 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I'm glad we
finally have you on the set.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.390 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: Happy to be here.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.190 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.620 align:middle line:10%
So you have-- you're a
master hypnotherapist,

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.780 align:middle line:10%
and you're on
other-- jeez, I think

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.160 align:middle line:10%
you're on the Travel
Channel, Discovery Channel.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.819 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people are now, and
a lot of production companies

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.600 align:middle line:10%
and audiences are now very
interested in the phenomena

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.610 align:middle line:10%
we call alien abduction.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.250 align:middle line:84%
But what I really like
about you is a lot of people

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.220 align:middle line:84%
try to trump it up a bit
without acknowledging some

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.840 align:middle line:90%
of the more honest parts of it.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And you don't
sugarcoat anything.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: No.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She doesn't
sugarcoat anything.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling you that right now.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.243 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk
about it for the good, bad,

00:01:27.243 --> 00:01:29.502 align:middle line:84%
and, well, for the warts
and all, let's just say.

00:01:29.502 --> 00:01:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Absolutely.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.252 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So first of
all, let's let people

00:01:32.252 --> 00:01:33.700 align:middle line:90%
get to know you a little bit.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Sure.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
this is important,

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.500 align:middle line:84%
because you wouldn't be doing
this-- there's some underlying

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.470 align:middle line:90%
reason for it.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.180 align:middle line:90%
So let's get into your story--

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: True.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --starting--
because I know your story,

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.737 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to have
you share with others--

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.660 align:middle line:84%
starting with your
mother's pregnancy before

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:90%
you even burst onto this planet.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: OK.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm a clinical hypnotherapist.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And
yes, it was in 1963.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.120 align:middle line:84%
My mother had experienced what I
would refer to as the abduction

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.350 align:middle line:90%
phenomena.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.600 align:middle line:84%
She said that for the nine
months that she was pregnant,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.449 align:middle line:84%
small little
extraterrestrial beings

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.450 align:middle line:90%
would come and take her away.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.910 align:middle line:90%
And she was disturbed by this.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Absolutely.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And so she told her
doctor, and her doctor

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.310 align:middle line:84%
sent her to a therapist who
sent her to a psychiatrist.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And all of them said, you're
seemingly healthy in every way,

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.620 align:middle line:84%
but you can't talk about
extraterrestrials or aliens

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.780 align:middle line:84%
because people will
think you're crazy.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.210 align:middle line:84%
You're nine months
pregnant, and you

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.920 align:middle line:84%
will risk having your
other children taken away.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And this terrified
her enough that she

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.970 align:middle line:84%
started to write
everything in a journal.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And then, when I was
50, we got a phone

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.830 align:middle line:84%
call after a little show
called "Topic UFO" aired.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And she had seen it and
recognized me and called me up.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.993 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, there's
a big missing gap here.

00:03:05.993 --> 00:03:07.660 align:middle line:84%
You weren't born yet,
and now you're 50.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get to what
happened in between there.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: OK.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.952 align:middle line:84%
Let's do that, because your
mom didn't bond with you.

00:03:13.952 --> 00:03:15.410 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
weird stuff that

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.360 align:middle line:84%
happened around your birth,
and this is really important.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, she
explained quite a bit of that.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, she asked me
when she called, do you

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:84%
want to hear the
story of your birth?

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And so I said I did
and put the phone on speaker,

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.170 align:middle line:90%
called my husband over.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.088 align:middle line:84%
We sat down, and I told
her, yeah, go ahead.

00:03:31.088 --> 00:03:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
your birth and everything

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.040 align:middle line:90%
that happened after that.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: So on the
19th of September,

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.720 align:middle line:84%
she had gone out
early in the morning,

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:84%
sixish, to sit in the backyard
and to sit in a lounge chair.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.540 align:middle line:90%
She was hot.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.540 align:middle line:84%
She went out there, and
she said all of a sudden,

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.860 align:middle line:84%
two small extraterrestrials
appeared on either side.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.620 align:middle line:84%
She felt like she was
starting to stand up,

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.100 align:middle line:84%
and she moved with them
through the apple orchard.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.660 align:middle line:84%
She said she experienced
a time distortion.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And she knew that her feet
weren't actually touching

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.770 align:middle line:84%
the ground, but she was standing
upright and moving forward.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.770 align:middle line:84%
When she got to the center
of the apple orchard,

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.370 align:middle line:84%
that's where the
tractors during harvest

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.090 align:middle line:84%
create a big circle
for clearing the trees

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.220 align:middle line:90%
and moving the tractors around.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.660 align:middle line:84%
There was a UFO
hovering above that.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.710 align:middle line:84%
As she looked up at
it, she instantly

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.350 align:middle line:90%
felt that she was in the craft.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.730 align:middle line:84%
She said her first
recognition of anything

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.980 align:middle line:84%
or her first attention
was drawn to the fact

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.220 align:middle line:84%
that her feet all of a
sudden felt very cold.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And she looked down and noticed
a sheen on a metal floor.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.490 align:middle line:84%
After that, they brought
her into another room,

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.370 align:middle line:84%
and later on a
table, a table that

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.100 align:middle line:84%
apparently looked very much like
probably a 1950s ironing board.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.580 align:middle line:84%
She said that there were
extraterrestrials behind her

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.500 align:middle line:90%
and down at her feet.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.570 align:middle line:84%
They had inserted
something through the navel

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.230 align:middle line:90%
and then also through the nose.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.690 align:middle line:84%
She said she heard a
popping in her head.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.190 align:middle line:84%
It sounded like one of
those Christmas poppers

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Poppers.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, the British poppers.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, that you pull.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.185 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:05:22.185 --> 00:05:23.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, we do that in Canada too.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
Canada, that's right.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.750 align:middle line:90%
You're Canadian, that's right.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And she said
it sounded like that.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And she was becoming scared
and starting to tell them,

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm scared, I'm
scared, I want to go.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And they reassured her that
they weren't interested

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.810 align:middle line:84%
in her, that they were just
interested in the baby.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.020 align:middle line:84%
This did not reassure her,
made her more frightened.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.060 align:middle line:84%
She felt very out of
control because she

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.780 align:middle line:84%
couldn't move anything or
run or do anything at all.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.720 align:middle line:84%
She went through a
plethora of examinations.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.510 align:middle line:84%
She was abducted probably
every three or four

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.000 align:middle line:84%
weeks she said for the
entire nine months.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, she would get bigger
glimpses of what was happening.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it would be
more of a residual memory.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.500 align:middle line:90%
Some memories were more clearer.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.900 align:middle line:84%
They always told
her it was the baby.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.180 align:middle line:90%
So when I-- so later that--

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.530 align:middle line:84%
after this abduction,
she woke up

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.360 align:middle line:84%
in the backyard
crying, partially nude,

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.170 align:middle line:84%
bleeding both vaginally
and from the nose.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.360 align:middle line:90%
She was calling for help.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:84%
The house where my father and
siblings were, nobody woke up.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.170 align:middle line:90%
Nobody heard anything.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.670 align:middle line:90%
She was calling and calling.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.320 align:middle line:84%
But a neighbor who was
considerably further down

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.990 align:middle line:84%
the road than the
house did hear her,

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.900 align:middle line:84%
and he came, aroused
the household,

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.800 align:middle line:84%
and they brought
her to the hospital

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.400 align:middle line:84%
where she labored until
9 o'clock in the morning.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So it was exactly at 9
o'clock in the morning

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:02.590 align:middle line:84%
on the 19th of the ninth
month in 1963 that I was born.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And both my mom and my dad have
very black hair, brown eyes.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.760 align:middle line:90%
They're very short.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.910 align:middle line:90%
My mom's like 5-1.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:10.710 align:middle line:90%
I am--

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You have blue eyes.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.140 align:middle line:90%
You're fair.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.768 align:middle line:90%
You're tall.

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Genetically, you don't really
resemble them, I take it?

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And I used
to be blonde for real.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.400 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now you're still
blonde, it's just by choice.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: That's right.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:23.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm just keeping it up.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: So
that was startling.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.850 align:middle line:84%
But she had a very difficult
time bonding with me.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.100 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't breastfeed.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.860 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't lay
down at all, ever.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.910 align:middle line:84%
I would always have to
be in an upright position

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.280 align:middle line:90%
or I would choke.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.340 align:middle line:90%
And she couldn't feed cow milk.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.060 align:middle line:84%
I think I was like the
first soy baby in Canada.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:48.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And
even that was gross.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.100 align:middle line:84%
But she still had a
very difficult time

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.628 align:middle line:90%
and had no interest.

00:07:54.628 --> 00:07:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, she had
bonded with your siblings?

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:57.712 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yes, she did.

00:07:57.712 --> 00:07:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she
was a good mom?

00:07:59.310 --> 00:07:59.445 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Eh--

00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:00.245 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kind of?

00:08:00.245 --> 00:08:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I mean,
I don't really know.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But she
bonded with them.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: She
bonded with them.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It wasn't like she
didn't bond with anybody.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: No she
didn't bond with me.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She does
didn't bond with you.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.498 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:07.498 --> 00:08:08.550 align:middle line:90%
She did not want me.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:09.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: And gave me up.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.550 align:middle line:84%
She-- first with the relatives,
and then into foster care.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And she was very sorry
when she told me.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.170 align:middle line:84%
She said that when she
saw all of the work

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:29.030 align:middle line:84%
that I've done for 25 years,
she said if there is a support

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:33.559 align:middle line:84%
group like I run for
her back in 1963,

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:35.130 align:middle line:84%
things might have
been different.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.039 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: But nobody listened.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.659 align:middle line:90%
Nobody believed her.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:39.650 align:middle line:90%
She was alone.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.030 align:middle line:90%
She was scared.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was a topic
that was so out there.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And having a support group, she
said, would have helped her.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.130 align:middle line:84%
So she saw and heard
about the support group

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.760 align:middle line:84%
on that little TV
show and had to let

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.130 align:middle line:90%
me know the story of my birth.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.978 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea at all that--

00:08:59.978 --> 00:09:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you hadn't been
in contact with your mom since.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Wouldn't have
recognized her on the street.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.870 align:middle line:84%
I saw her I think when I was
like eight-ish and maybe one

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:14.440 align:middle line:90%
time after, then later again.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.272 align:middle line:84%
But through all my childhood,
teen years and everything,

00:09:17.272 --> 00:09:18.480 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't have recognized her.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.200 align:middle line:84%
She-- there was no attempt
to stay in touch with you.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: None.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And again, you
say in the 1960s, which

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.590 align:middle line:84%
is interesting, because
a few days ago I

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.840 align:middle line:84%
had Paul Hynek on
the set, and we

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.030 align:middle line:84%
were doing an interview
regarding Project Blue

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Book and his dad Alan Hynek, who
was there to essentially help

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.470 align:middle line:84%
cover up the various experiences
people were having in

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.810 align:middle line:90%
the late '50s and early '60s.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.570 align:middle line:84%
His job was working on
behalf of the government

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.103 align:middle line:90%
to say, oh, please analyze this.

00:09:45.103 --> 00:09:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Oh, by the way, let them
know it was a weather

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.010 align:middle line:90%
balloon in the end, will you?

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:48.820 align:middle line:90%
Wink-wink.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
challenging for him,

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.480 align:middle line:84%
and he took another
position ultimately.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.640 align:middle line:84%
But this discrediting of
people back in the day.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.440 align:middle line:90%
And so your mom--

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Look
what it did to her.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.705 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It shattered her.

00:09:58.705 --> 00:10:00.413 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, she felt--

00:10:00.413 --> 00:10:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: It affected
my life as well.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I might have
been raised in a family.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And do you think
that this gave you

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.260 align:middle line:84%
a certain bit of grist, being
bounced around like you were?

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.170 align:middle line:90%
Because you seem-- you seem--

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:15.550 align:middle line:90%
we all have our stuff--

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:18.610 align:middle line:84%
you seem like you came out of
it very committed, very clear

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and confident,
generally speaking.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: I was born this way.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:23.740 align:middle line:90%
I was.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And I've always had a good
compass for right and wrong.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.450 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very non-judgemental.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:38.480 align:middle line:84%
I think that people do
things for different reasons,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and we might not ever
know what we might do.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.375 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
deserve second chances

00:10:43.375 --> 00:10:46.880 align:middle line:84%
and fresh starts,
new opportunities.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.040 align:middle line:84%
So I've always had that sort
of non-judgemental aspect,

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.300 align:middle line:90%
and that's really helped.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:57.130 align:middle line:84%
But I could-- using that compass
to know right from wrong,

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.160 align:middle line:84%
my inner voice would just
say, that's not right.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.330 align:middle line:84%
It's too bad that's happening,
but one day I'll be 18

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.370 align:middle line:90%
and I'll make my own life.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:11.040 align:middle line:84%
Until then, I basically have
no power, which was the truth.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.370 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't wait.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Till you're 18
and you had the power.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.540 align:middle line:84%
18, I bought a house and
continued my education

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and started a life, exactly
what I wanted to do.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it was what
I wanted to have.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:29.440 align:middle line:84%
But absolutely, I could
tell right from wrong.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't
take it personally.

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.270 align:middle line:84%
I think that makes
a big difference.

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: When somebody
else is vomiting their drama

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:42.090 align:middle line:84%
all over you, it's sometimes
hard not to take it personally.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:45.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's also very easy
to see that it's them.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.390 align:middle line:84%
So we can control
our own reaction,

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.130 align:middle line:90%
stay within our own power.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.412 align:middle line:90%
We're unaffected.

00:11:52.412 --> 00:11:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say that I
went through it all unaffected.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:58.440 align:middle line:84%
I did a ton of emotional
clearing work by the time

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.327 align:middle line:90%
I was 30.

00:12:00.327 --> 00:12:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, one
thing that happened

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.250 align:middle line:84%
is, after you found
out all of this,

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:06.950 align:middle line:84%
you went back and started
doing research, as you do,

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and you started doing
research in that region.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Was there any-- were
there sightings?

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:11.732 align:middle line:84%
Was there UFO activity
and so forth--

00:12:11.732 --> 00:12:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --around that time
surrounding your mother's

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:15.710 align:middle line:90%
pregnancy and birth?

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:90%
And you did find something.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Absolutely.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.680 align:middle line:84%
I went right to it
probably by the time I--

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.910 align:middle line:84%
before I even hung up the phone,
I was thinking, what can I do?

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.160 align:middle line:90%
Where can I look?

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.720 align:middle line:84%
But absolutely, there
were numerous reportings

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:35.330 align:middle line:84%
of UFOs over Michigan,
the Detroit metro area.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.340 align:middle line:84%
We lived in Windsor,
Ontario, which

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.300 align:middle line:84%
is one mile from Detroit
metro, basically a bridge.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.780 align:middle line:90%
And Ohio, the tri-state area.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:50.240 align:middle line:84%
So during '63 to
1968, there was what

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.570 align:middle line:84%
you would call cluster
sightings of UFOs

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:55.010 align:middle line:90%
all through that region.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.200 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting
thing that I did find out

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.700 align:middle line:84%
about that, Windsor, Ontario, on
the Great Lakes, is near what--

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.360 align:middle line:90%
is Algonquin Park.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Algonquins are
indigenous people,

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.730 align:middle line:84%
are First Nation
people of Canada.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Algonquins are directly
related to the and Anunnaki.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And the Anunnaki, of course,
during Mesopotamian Sumerian

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:17.600 align:middle line:90%
were the sky gods.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.880 align:middle line:90%
They called them that.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And so the Algonquin
Indians and the Anunnaki

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.690 align:middle line:90%
are somehow connected.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And I found that
very interesting,

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:35.360 align:middle line:84%
because in all of the
research that I've done,

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:42.020 align:middle line:84%
the most tangible is the
research around the Anunnaki.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And we can say greys and
reptiles and reptilian aliens

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:48.490 align:middle line:90%
and dracos and everything else.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:52.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's the Anunnaki that
were written about in history.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:57.620 align:middle line:84%
It's the Anunnaki that we
have depictions of that

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.510 align:middle line:90%
are thousands of years old.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And so those extraterrestrials--
and they're clearly ETs.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.232 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's ever claimed they
weren't, and nobody's ever--

00:14:07.232 --> 00:14:09.440 align:middle line:84%
well, some people may have
claimed they didn't exist,

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.250 align:middle line:90%
but that would be ridiculous.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.640 align:middle line:90%
So now let's forward it.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.960 align:middle line:90%
Now you've escaped.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.260 align:middle line:90%
You're 18 years old.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:17.060 align:middle line:90%
You're on your own.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.330 align:middle line:84%
You're educating--
you're becoming educated.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:24.260 align:middle line:84%
What ultimately took you into
hypnotherapy first and then

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.750 align:middle line:84%
specifically into
abduction phenomena?

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:27.900 align:middle line:90%
Because it seemed like--

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.067 align:middle line:84%
seems as though you were
born to do this, literally.

00:14:30.067 --> 00:14:31.233 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: I was going to--

00:14:31.233 --> 00:14:32.060 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.900 align:middle line:84%
I was going to be a
psychologist or a psychiatrist.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.580 align:middle line:84%
That's where my
education was taking me.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And something about
their philosophy

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.660 align:middle line:90%
didn't sit right with me.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:53.212 align:middle line:84%
Do you pay a psychologist
$200 an hour,

00:14:53.212 --> 00:14:54.670 align:middle line:84%
and all she is
going to say-- well,

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.487 align:middle line:90%
how does that make you feel?

00:14:56.487 --> 00:14:57.820 align:middle line:90%
They already know how they feel.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:58.987 align:middle line:90%
They're coming to an expert.

00:14:58.987 --> 00:15:00.280 align:middle line:90%
They want some answers.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.850 align:middle line:84%
So I started to think that that
wasn't the right path for me.

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:07.930 align:middle line:84%
But I felt a desire
to be in service.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:15.570 align:middle line:84%
I felt compassion,
mercy, and pity,

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:18.480 align:middle line:90%
and for a lot of situations.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to teach
people how to self-correct,

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:25.600 align:middle line:90%
to begin to heal.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And somebody suggested,
why don't you

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:29.360 align:middle line:90%
try this hypnotherapy?

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.730 align:middle line:90%
I tried a hypnotherapy session.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.660 align:middle line:90%
It was unbelievable.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So I went, and it
was very powerful.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:38.548 align:middle line:84%
And I said OK,
that's what I'll do.

00:15:38.548 --> 00:15:40.757 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was the
subject of your first session?

00:15:40.757 --> 00:15:42.190 align:middle line:84%
What started
bubbling up for you?

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, I was
already doing field research.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.890 align:middle line:84%
I was setting cameras
up all around Sacramento

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:49.710 align:middle line:90%
and trying to gain--

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:52.510 align:middle line:84%
because back then,
you know, show us

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:54.100 align:middle line:84%
all a video, then
we'll believe you.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And you make the video, and they
say, well, that's Photoshopped,

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.090 align:middle line:90%
even before Photoshop.

00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you'd
already developed

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.560 align:middle line:84%
an interest in the paranormal
and also UFOs and such.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, not the
paranormal as much as UFOs.

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would say UFOs, and
then a higher spirituality.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:18.370 align:middle line:84%
That was my interest, something
that supersedes the known gods.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.770 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was interested in.

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And the paranormal
stuff, it just

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:26.200 align:middle line:84%
bleeds through, so you
get involved in it.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.410 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, it was the UFO thing.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:31.930 align:middle line:90%
I had seen things.

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd found out
later, during this research,

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.700 align:middle line:84%
that my grandmother,
back in 1939,

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.800 align:middle line:90%
had come out of the farm house--

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:46.310 align:middle line:84%
she had a basket of
laundry hooked on her hip.

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:49.120 align:middle line:84%
She went around the back
to pin it on the line,

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.630 align:middle line:84%
and they're over
the corn fields--

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:53.620 align:middle line:90%
corn was cropped.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.020 align:middle line:90%
It was already fall.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.910 align:middle line:90%
She said she saw a UFO.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And she watched it, and she
held tight to the basket

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.150 align:middle line:84%
because they had those
old ringer machines

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.317 align:middle line:84%
and she didn't want to have
to do the laundry again.

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:09.040 align:middle line:84%
So she almost dropped it,
but she made sure she didn't.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.210 align:middle line:84%
She kept her eye on the UFO,
and it wobbled and then shot

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:15.829 align:middle line:90%
straight out.

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And she kept that secret
and then found out

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.420 align:middle line:90%
that there were others--

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was this your mother's
mother or your father's mother?

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:24.589 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: My father's.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your father's mother.

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:26.260 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.970 align:middle line:90%
So both sides.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: And so yeah.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:30.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.410 align:middle line:84%
So how old were you
when you found out

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:36.960 align:middle line:84%
about your
grandmother's incident?

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Old.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.710 align:middle line:90%
You were already up there.

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:41.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: I'm already old.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.428 align:middle line:90%
I was up there.

00:17:42.428 --> 00:17:43.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, she didn't talk about it.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why did you develop an
interest in UFOs yourself then

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:49.760 align:middle line:84%
and start trying to
film them and so forth?

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Because I saw one.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.500 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:54.470 align:middle line:90%
Where did you see it?

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:55.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Well, I saw--

00:17:55.910 --> 00:18:00.940 align:middle line:84%
well, I saw a UFO
when I was six.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And I used to play
out in this big field.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:05.390 align:middle line:90%
We'd build forts out there.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.080 align:middle line:90%
And one day, I saw a UFO.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.630 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't sure what it was,
and I didn't call it a UFO.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.610 align:middle line:84%
I think we called
it a spaceship.

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, I went
back to where we had seen it,

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:22.110 align:middle line:84%
and there were tape
all around the area.

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:24.330 align:middle line:84%
We weren't allowed to
get into the field.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And they had dug
this gigantic hole,

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.810 align:middle line:84%
and the dirt had
been pushed way up.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And I went underneath the
tape and climbed up the dirt

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.610 align:middle line:84%
and looked down, and I didn't
actually see the UFO in there,

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:40.950 align:middle line:84%
but I saw all these
people working that didn't

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:43.440 align:middle line:90%
look like regular worker guys.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And one of them saw me, and so
I ran, like any kid would do.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I ran,
and I ran fast.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:56.250 align:middle line:84%
But I know intuitively at that
point that something was up.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Then, two years later,
we had told the adults

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:04.487 align:middle line:84%
who were caring for us that we
were going to pitch a pup tent

00:19:04.487 --> 00:19:05.445 align:middle line:90%
and sleep in the tent--

00:19:05.445 --> 00:19:07.600 align:middle line:90%
I was eight-- in the backyard.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.060 align:middle line:90%
But that wasn't the plan.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:13.760 align:middle line:84%
The real plan was to sneak out
and to go down to Jackson Park

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.510 align:middle line:84%
where there was a
carnival and walk around

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.700 align:middle line:90%
the carnival at night time.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I got
separated from everyone,

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.490 align:middle line:84%
and I walked to the
edge of the carnival.

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And I remember standing
just looking out

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.150 align:middle line:84%
into the darkness of
the park, and I was

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:32.910 align:middle line:90%
beginning to make out shapes.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And then two grays
walked forward,

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.330 align:middle line:90%
and they beckoned to me.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And without hesitation,
I walked towards them.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And I remember going down a
ramp and then entering what

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.500 align:middle line:90%
must have been a spacecraft.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Everything was highly
polished, and the sheen--

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:02.120 align:middle line:84%
again, my mom said
it's bright in there.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Even though the colors
are dull, there's

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:07.340 align:middle line:84%
a brightness to
the sheen in them.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:13.690 align:middle line:90%
And there was a sphere of light.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And the ET, a gray, picked it
up, and they brought it to me,

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.350 align:middle line:90%
and they handed it to me.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And they placed it in my
hands, and I started to shake,

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:29.690 align:middle line:84%
because whatever it
was, it was alive.

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:30.990 align:middle line:90%
And I felt that.

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And the colors began to change,
and there was internal sparks

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:37.190 align:middle line:90%
of energy inside of it.

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And they came and took
it away, and that's

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.100 align:middle line:90%
all I remember about that.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:46.680 align:middle line:84%
But after that, I
glimpsed certain things

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and was very interested
in the night sky.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.180 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't have
been odd for them

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.880 align:middle line:84%
to find me out in the
backyard in the middle

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:59.690 align:middle line:84%
of the night, head tilted
back, eyes wide, transfixed.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we were talking
at lunch today before we were

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.170 align:middle line:84%
doing the show, and you were
talking about how you would

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.680 align:middle line:84%
tape lines on the windows
and you'd have little--

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:10.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: I created a grid--

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, a grid.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: --so that I could--

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:18.880 align:middle line:84%
with string and tacks and
tape, I created a grid

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.477 align:middle line:84%
so that I could chart the
movement of planets as they--

00:21:23.477 --> 00:21:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you were 10.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, as they moved
through the constellations.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And there were a couple
of constellations

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.315 align:middle line:84%
that I was very
interested in as a child.

00:21:32.315 --> 00:21:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which ones?

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Orion
was one of them.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.800 align:middle line:84%
But I always searched the night
sky for the Pleiadian stars.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pleiadian, yeah.

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: That was
what I was interested in.

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.130 align:middle line:84%
I liked other things
as a kid, but--

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This was your thing.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: That was my thing.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this-- obviously,
I think people get the drift now

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.350 align:middle line:84%
that you were born
into the-- you

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:58.370 align:middle line:84%
came into this incarnation
maybe groomed, maybe watched.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:21:59.660 align:middle line:90%
Who knows what your DNA is.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've had
any of that done, but--

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: I won't.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:02.845 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah don't.

00:22:02.845 --> 00:22:04.160 align:middle line:90%
Don't bother.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.270 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to.

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.502 align:middle line:84%
And so the point is you came
in to do this very thing.

00:22:08.502 --> 00:22:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: I believe I have.

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
totally believe you have.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And you're here to help
many other people who've

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:17.850 align:middle line:84%
had similar experiences, and
some who may believe they have,

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.600 align:middle line:84%
and some who are just flat
delusional and even mentally

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:20.870 align:middle line:90%
ill.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Absolutely.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when
you started working

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:24.770 align:middle line:84%
with people in
hypnotherapy, when

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:26.960 align:middle line:84%
did the whole
abduction phenomena

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.490 align:middle line:90%
start popping through?

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: On
the day of finals.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:31.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:36.860 align:middle line:84%
I was-- we had to do a
live regression in front

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:38.870 align:middle line:90%
of a panel of four judges.

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:40.790 align:middle line:84%
I had been a master
hypnotist, and then I

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:44.030 align:middle line:84%
was teaching
hypnotherapy, as opposed

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:47.720 align:middle line:84%
to just hypnosis, the
therapy aspect of it

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.350 align:middle line:90%
And so it was a simple session.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:54.590 align:middle line:84%
It was just really to
see if I could regress,

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:57.620 align:middle line:84%
do the topic that the
subject was interested in,

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.620 align:middle line:84%
and then count them
back up appropriately.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And as I counted him
down, everything was cool.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And this young man was
very interested in finding

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:09.560 align:middle line:84%
some creativity that
he felt was suppressed.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.240 align:middle line:90%
I believe he was a musician.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to unblock
that and find his stuff.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:16.190 align:middle line:90%
So that was cool.

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:17.870 align:middle line:90%
We decided to go look for that.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
he spontaneously

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.450 align:middle line:90%
regressed to a 10-year-old.

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And he's with his family,
and they're camping.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And him and his brother see
a UFO land and the door open

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.860 align:middle line:90%
and two occupants come out.

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How'd the panel feel?

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, they were
cool right up until I asked,

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.870 align:middle line:84%
what did the
occupants look like?

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:51.730 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, a softball
size sphere of light

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:55.870 align:middle line:84%
appeared, physically
manifested into the room

00:23:55.870 --> 00:24:00.770 align:middle line:84%
at forehead level, zipped
down his body, disappeared--

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did anyone
see it beside you?

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I turned around,
looked over my shoulder

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.760 align:middle line:90%
at the judges, mouth open.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:07.560 align:middle line:90%
They're like--

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.768 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So they all saw it.

00:24:08.768 --> 00:24:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Two.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:10.750 align:middle line:90%
Two were writing.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:11.380 align:middle line:90%
Two saw it.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: And me.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And she's indicating
to me, well,

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.120 align:middle line:84%
go, you have to keep
going, because I'm like,

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.450 align:middle line:90%
you guys see that?

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, you've
got somebody under.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:90%
Keep working.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:29.550 align:middle line:84%
So I asked the question
again, and he said, what?

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:31.680 align:middle line:90%
We're not camping.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.470 align:middle line:90%
And he-- mind was wiped.

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:36.160 align:middle line:90%
He had no recollection--

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: After the ball came.

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: After the
ball of light came.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
weren't to reveal--

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:39.720 align:middle line:90%
he wasn't to reveal that.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: But they
were taking notes.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.090 align:middle line:90%
Everybody heard him say it.

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:42.930 align:middle line:90%
They saw it.

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And, well, I got a
reputation then, Regina.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:47.490 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I bet you did.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I might have
already had one for-- no.

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If there was weird
stuff, send them to Laurie.

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: If there were
UFOs or aliens involved, yeah.

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.258 align:middle line:90%
Well, yes, that was--

00:24:58.258 --> 00:25:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you've been
dealing with it since day one.

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:01.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.778 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the
phenomena itself.

00:25:04.778 --> 00:25:07.320 align:middle line:84%
What I loved about John Mack's
work, besides the fact that he

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.510 align:middle line:84%
was brave enough to agree
to do it, was he said,

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:11.010 align:middle line:84%
no, there's something
going on here.

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Too many people are having
the exact same experience

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:16.980 align:middle line:84%
and coming away with the same
feelings or enhanced abilities

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.510 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:20.622 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what you normally

00:25:20.622 --> 00:25:22.080 align:middle line:84%
see, because you
say there are five

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.200 align:middle line:90%
different types of abductions.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Of abduction, yes.

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:26.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.320 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
it on a basic level.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.785 align:middle line:84%
And then, I'd love for you to
share maybe a story or two.

00:25:31.785 --> 00:25:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: We have
thousands of those.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know you do.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Just pick a couple favorites
that illustrate this.

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, there are
many forms of abduction.

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And it depends on who
the abductors are.

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:47.052 align:middle line:84%
I believe there are about six
or seven major abductor races.

00:25:47.052 --> 00:25:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you want
to tell us who this are?

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:51.045 align:middle line:90%
A race of blues.

00:25:51.045 --> 00:25:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what are--
where are they from?

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.060 align:middle line:90%
What's the deal with them?

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: We don't know
where anyone is from.

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:58.020 align:middle line:90%
I can speculate.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.030 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
the abductor races

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:03.240 align:middle line:84%
exist within the red
dwarf star systems which

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:07.405 align:middle line:84%
do vibrate at a different
frequency than the planet.

00:26:07.405 --> 00:26:08.530 align:middle line:90%
They're outside our vision.

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:12.220 align:middle line:84%
They have a longer,
slower wave of energy.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.890 align:middle line:84%
So when a person
is outside at night

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and they look up at the sky,
for every star they see,

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.830 align:middle line:84%
there are four or five red
dwarf stars around them

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:21.000 align:middle line:90%
that we can't see.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly,
because we're only seeing

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.800 align:middle line:90%
our perceptual dimension.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Exactly.

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
all of them are

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.870 align:middle line:84%
on our side of the
Milky Way within

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:37.030 align:middle line:84%
that particular bandwidth or
frequency within the red dwarf

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:37.830 align:middle line:90%
star system.

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:42.180 align:middle line:84%
So the short grays, tall greys,
the reptilians, the blues,

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:46.020 align:middle line:84%
the tall whites, and
the mantis beings.

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.908 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is a hierarchy
among the races.

00:26:48.908 --> 00:26:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's the hierarchy?

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: So the blues,
they're squat, short.

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.700 align:middle line:90%
They walk funny.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.180 align:middle line:84%
The first time I saw
one, honest to God,

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.848 align:middle line:90%
I thought, that's one ugly--

00:27:02.848 --> 00:27:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like a little
troll or something.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Like a Smurf.

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A Smurf.

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: No hat,
but blue like a Smurf.

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And he lumbered, and he was
like the same width as height,

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.620 align:middle line:90%
practically-- not precisely.

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, man, he's
awkward and maybe deformed,

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.960 align:middle line:90%
and certainly ugly.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow, that child
really needs to be loved.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And I actually picked it
up, dropped it on my hip

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:35.150 align:middle line:84%
like you would a child, and then
just felt this intense anger

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.280 align:middle line:84%
from probably like
a 1,000 year old--

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, entity.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:39.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Entity.

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:40.250 align:middle line:90%
Faux pas.

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.030 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.360 align:middle line:90%
I made a mistake.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.660 align:middle line:84%
There was a tall gray
who actually spoke over

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:51.290 align:middle line:84%
my head outside of
my telepathy ability

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:56.870 align:middle line:84%
to the blue to explain
that it was a mistake.

00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:57.770 align:middle line:90%
I insulted it.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:03.050 align:middle line:84%
So I guess some of them
do have emotional energy.

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:04.705 align:middle line:90%
So blues.

00:28:04.705 --> 00:28:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
they're at the top?

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:06.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: No.

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or the
bottom, or where?

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: They
work with the grays.

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They work
with the grays, OK.

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: The short
grays, which are half bot.

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:18.380 align:middle line:84%
They're not full sentient
beings like the taller grays.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:22.010 align:middle line:84%
They work with-- the
blues and the short grays

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:27.050 align:middle line:84%
are like the workforce, tall
greys, kind of management.

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:30.080 align:middle line:10%
And then you have corporate,
which we're looking

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.110 align:middle line:10%
at reptilian, and mantis.

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:35.510 align:middle line:84%
The mantis are very
interesting, very hive minded,

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:36.440 align:middle line:90%
very connected.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.780 align:middle line:84%
So part of my work as
just being a researcher

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:42.390 align:middle line:84%
and understanding the races,
the abduction phenomena,

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.920 align:middle line:84%
but the effects on the
subject's consciousness, how

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:49.340 align:middle line:84%
that changes them, what makes
them different, and why them.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:52.520 align:middle line:84%
That's very curious to me, and
I'd like to get those answers.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:56.420 align:middle line:84%
So I want to try to do
psychological profiling based

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.450 align:middle line:84%
on the witness accounts
with the specific entities.

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you say
tall whites as well?

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:01.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, I did.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, tall
whites as well.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, tall
whites are up there.

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:08.910 align:middle line:84%
They are more-- they
have full families.

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.360 align:middle line:90%
They can be in a relationship.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.725 align:middle line:90%
That can have children.

00:29:11.725 --> 00:29:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And they have a different
biology than us,

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.722 align:middle line:84%
but they can survive
on our planet.

00:29:17.722 --> 00:29:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, there have been
a lot of accounts of them--

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:20.765 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: In New Mexico.

00:29:20.765 --> 00:29:21.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, in New Mexico.

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Indian Springs.

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:22.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.470 align:middle line:90%
Charles Hall.

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:25.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.210 align:middle line:90%
Charles Hall stuff.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:27.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.500 align:middle line:84%
So now, when-- so
you don't know.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.600 align:middle line:84%
When you first
start with a person,

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.850 align:middle line:84%
are they generally
able to identify

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:36.890 align:middle line:84%
the kind of being that
they're interfacing--

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:39.050 align:middle line:90%
they've been interfacing with?

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:42.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Before I even
ask them anything like that,

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:46.310 align:middle line:84%
I do a full-blown
intake interview.

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:50.720 align:middle line:84%
I get to know them to
the best of my ability

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.870 align:middle line:84%
by asking very specific
questions that will give me

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:56.210 align:middle line:90%
insight into their psyche.

00:29:56.210 --> 00:30:01.850 align:middle line:84%
So it helps me determine
where they're coming from.

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And then, after a good
hour, or more sometimes,

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.642 align:middle line:84%
then I let them
tell their story.

00:30:07.642 --> 00:30:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, at this
point, can you tell--

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.060 align:middle line:84%
is this where you can discern
whether some people are just

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.495 align:middle line:84%
in it for the
phenomena or they've

00:30:14.495 --> 00:30:16.120 align:middle line:84%
seen something and
they're making it up

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.940 align:middle line:90%
or whether they're mentally ill?

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I get a really
good idea at that point.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:26.020 align:middle line:84%
If the person's healthy,
I believe they're solid,

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.680 align:middle line:84%
I'll continue and do
a regression session.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.140 align:middle line:84%
If at that point--
and it does happen--

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:37.760 align:middle line:84%
I find that they're exhibiting
symptoms of schizophrenia

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:42.300 align:middle line:84%
or some type of hallucinations,
auditory hallucinations,

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:46.430 align:middle line:84%
they hear voices in their head,
but they don't see things--

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:48.350 align:middle line:84%
some people, the
way they express

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:50.130 align:middle line:90%
themselves is very important.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:55.040 align:middle line:84%
That's why culture, religion,
how a person is raised,

00:30:55.040 --> 00:31:00.080 align:middle line:84%
their core belief system is
very important in the way they

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.300 align:middle line:90%
express the experience.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:07.760 align:middle line:84%
So somebody maybe from
Venezuela would not

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.975 align:middle line:84%
express it the same
way as somebody in--

00:31:09.975 --> 00:31:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Des Moines.

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --Cambodia,
or Des Moines even maybe.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:17.030 align:middle line:84%
But say-- well,
culturally in America,

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:18.360 align:middle line:90%
there are some similarities.

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.810 align:middle line:84%
So most of-- at least
some of the older cases

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:24.020 align:middle line:84%
were all within
the gray ET range,

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.890 align:middle line:84%
whereas in South America, it
might be more of a Chupacabra.

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:28.850 align:middle line:84%
In the Middle East,
it's the Jinn.

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:30.560 align:middle line:90%
In China, it's the Jinn.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:35.540 align:middle line:10%
In the UK, they're more
prone to see something that

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.490 align:middle line:10%
would look like a Pleiadian.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:40.820 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
factors have to be

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.670 align:middle line:84%
weighed in as I'm
listening to the way they

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:45.650 align:middle line:90%
express themselves.

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, some
people, I have to say

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:51.650 align:middle line:84%
that I need to refer
you to somebody who

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:53.067 align:middle line:90%
can help you better than I can.

00:31:53.067 --> 00:31:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And that a
regression at this time

00:31:55.850 --> 00:32:00.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel would serve
their highest purpose.

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:03.060 align:middle line:90%
And with that, I can refer them.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:04.200 align:middle line:90%
I work in a clinic.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.350 align:middle line:90%
We have multiple practitioners.

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:09.120 align:middle line:10%
And they can just
go down the hall

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:13.320 align:middle line:10%
or find somebody
else more suited.

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And I also have referrals
from psychologists

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:22.440 align:middle line:84%
who send me people who have
extraterrestrial stuff.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's new.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:26.860 align:middle line:84%
That's only been in
the last five years.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.100 align:middle line:84%
I've never had that
happen in my career

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:35.140 align:middle line:84%
before where doctors were
believing their patient

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.990 align:middle line:84%
and then sending them to me and
not a psychiatrist for meds.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.800 align:middle line:84%
That's quite-- that's
very progressive.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: That's very
progressive, very progressive.

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we can do a
couple different things here.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:49.390 align:middle line:84%
When you're speaking,
for example-- because you

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:50.410 align:middle line:90%
go all over the world.

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:51.790 align:middle line:84%
You've done
regressions all over.

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: I have.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You get the group
psychology around abduction

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:58.360 align:middle line:84%
phenomena in a number of
countries, in Southeast

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.350 align:middle line:90%
Asia, China, and so forth.

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:05.200 align:middle line:84%
So is there a sense of the
type of experience regionally?

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.660 align:middle line:84%
For example-- because I
know you've been to Vietnam

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.970 align:middle line:90%
and Cambodia and such--

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:12.460 align:middle line:84%
is there a kind of
experience they have?

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:13.840 align:middle line:90%
Launch into your stories there.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.380 align:middle line:90%
There are some good ones.

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And I want to know if there's
a kind of experience they have

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:22.870 align:middle line:84%
there that's a hallmark of that
region compared to a hallmark

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:24.970 align:middle line:84%
experience in the
States, for example.

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: So during
Vietnam, off the Ho Chi Minh

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Trail near a village called
Cam Lo, there was a battle.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:38.670 align:middle line:84%
We were fighting the
Cong, the Viet Cong.

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:42.390 align:middle line:84%
But one night, we
joined together.

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:47.460 align:middle line:84%
The Viet Cong and the
American troops fought UFOs.

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:52.910 align:middle line:84%
We believe, and I've come
to the conclusion for now,

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:56.880 align:middle line:84%
that a portal was
accidentally opened.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.780 align:middle line:84%
These UFOs come flying
out of it freaked out,

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.520 align:middle line:84%
and now everybody's
firing on them.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.310 align:middle line:90%
The battle raged all night long.

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:06.660 align:middle line:90%
Smoke all over.

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: First, how did
you find out about this?

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:11.398 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: A client was there.

00:34:11.398 --> 00:34:12.315 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:34:12.315 --> 00:34:15.489 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Because
after that happened--

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:21.510 align:middle line:84%
and General Brown, who oversaw
this, called a press release.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:23.909 align:middle line:90%
He called for a press release.

00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And he told them
about everything.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And ABC, NBC, and CBS all
chose to shut that story down,

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.800 align:middle line:90%
and they did not publish.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's normal.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.389 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: That's normal.

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:38.201 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy, but--

00:34:38.201 --> 00:34:39.659 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When I
was a news anchor,

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:41.670 align:middle line:84%
when those would come
across writers or whomever--

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:42.409 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: And they'd be like--

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We were never
allowed to report it.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.352 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: But it's a general.

00:34:45.352 --> 00:34:46.810 align:middle line:84%
How much more
credible can you get?

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:47.699 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:51.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: But some of the
men, and particularly two that I

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.880 align:middle line:90%
work with--

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:58.770 align:middle line:84%
one was sent down,
and his job was

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:02.400 align:middle line:84%
to watch if the enemy
began to come forward.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.320 align:middle line:84%
He was to run up,
tell a sergeant.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.630 align:middle line:84%
The Sergeant was then
going to move the line.

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:11.880 align:middle line:84%
He said he went down to do
his duty, and all of a sudden,

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:15.478 align:middle line:84%
for no reason at all, he just
laid down and fell asleep.

00:35:15.478 --> 00:35:16.770 align:middle line:90%
I went, well, what do you mean?

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:20.940 align:middle line:84%
You topped up against a tree,
pulled your helmet down,

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:22.570 align:middle line:90%
and had a nap?

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:24.330 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:29.770 align:middle line:84%
I went down on my knees, I
fell forward, and I was out.

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I woke up, and I

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.020 align:middle line:90%
was scared, really scared.

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And he radioed, and he ran,
and he told his sergeant.

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:41.950 align:middle line:84%
They started to
line up and move.

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:43.990 align:middle line:90%
They were 150 in the troop.

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:47.710 align:middle line:84%
They were going through
to the next spot.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And they passed what he
said was a giant insect.

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was about the size of a
car, like a small Volkswagen.

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was an insect
extraterrestrial,

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.040 align:middle line:90%
and it terrified him.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.700 align:middle line:90%
He suppressed it--

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --but had
nightmares and memories.

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:11.520 align:middle line:84%
His nightmares and
memories about Vietnam

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.690 align:middle line:90%
were not fighting the war.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
fighting insect aliens.

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: It was
seeing these insectoids,

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.782 align:middle line:90%
which was a very unusual story.

00:36:20.782 --> 00:36:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not a mantis?

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Not a mantis.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Another type.

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Huge.

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:26.940 align:middle line:90%
Mantis are very tall, but thin.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And these were like an
actual giant-sized bug.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.150 align:middle line:90%
So I speculated here, for sure.

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:38.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering, is it
possible that the portal that

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:41.543 align:middle line:84%
was opened into a dimension
is a giant dimension where

00:36:41.543 --> 00:36:42.460 align:middle line:90%
everything's that big?

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Maybe
people are 18 feet,

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:50.070 align:middle line:84%
and their bugs are
the size of a car.

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Conceivable.

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I think
that's possible.

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
have to say, just

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:57.600 align:middle line:84%
to validate what you're
saying, I went out

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.580 align:middle line:84%
with Stephen Greer's
group a couple of times

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:00.880 align:middle line:90%
for the week out in the field.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And there were various
things that were interesting.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:08.100 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that I
kept personally experiencing

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:12.510 align:middle line:84%
were slightly phased-off
craft, where I could see them.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:15.150 align:middle line:84%
I could see them when we
would meditate and so forth.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:18.360 align:middle line:84%
I could see them, and I
could explain where they were

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.680 align:middle line:90%
and what they looked like.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And one actually was
caught the final day

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.600 align:middle line:84%
on a digital camera, which
were just introduced.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:30.030 align:middle line:84%
This was 20 years ago, so it was
fairly new digital photography.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And I could see them every night
and where they were sitting

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:35.790 align:middle line:84%
and what the craft looked
like and everything

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:38.070 align:middle line:90%
in my inner vision.

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And I would explain
it to the group.

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was finally caught
exactly like that on film.

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.637 align:middle line:84%
But the same thing going
out to Crestone later,

00:37:44.637 --> 00:37:47.220 align:middle line:84%
and they were craft all behind--
they were looking in the sky.

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:48.887 align:middle line:84%
They were parked in
the field behind us.

00:37:48.887 --> 00:37:50.782 align:middle line:84%
Small craft were in
the field behind us.

00:37:50.782 --> 00:37:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I kept
saying, is they're here,

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:57.680 align:middle line:84%
they're just slightly phased
off of our spectrum, our ability

00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.480 align:middle line:90%
to perceive.

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.860 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: They can dip
in and out of frequency

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:06.630 align:middle line:10%
into what I call dark space,
which is outside of our vision.

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And so when one
blinks out in the sky,

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:10.650 align:middle line:84%
it's not-- they're not
turning their lights out.

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:11.990 align:middle line:90%
They're really not there.

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:13.470 align:middle line:90%
They're phasing into--

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Shifting
frequency ranges just out

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:17.040 align:middle line:90%
of our perceptual range.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.830 align:middle line:84%
So I'm comfortable with
that because I have

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.930 align:middle line:90%
experienced that personally.

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:24.030 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people,
I think, a lot of us

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:29.460 align:middle line:84%
don't understand that kind
of inner dimensionality.

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, we all
have the ability to do that.

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:36.120 align:middle line:90%
The human mind is incredible.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.570 align:middle line:84%
The brain itself is
primarily a processor,

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:42.210 align:middle line:84%
just receiving the
information and storing it

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:46.890 align:middle line:84%
into the subconscious mind
based on the emotional impact

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:48.300 align:middle line:90%
of the information.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.130 align:middle line:84%
So something very
exciting is going

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:51.780 align:middle line:84%
to stand out in the
subconscious mind

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:54.300 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be going to
that information first.

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Other stuff with lower
impact is based down

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:02.220 align:middle line:84%
into the subconscious as almost
unimportant and sometimes

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.050 align:middle line:90%
harder to retrieve.

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:07.710 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
we have a higher mind

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:11.130 align:middle line:84%
where we work in the
gamma wave frequency

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and we are able to
perceive far more.

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:16.950 align:middle line:84%
I've been a meditator
now for 40 years,

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:18.855 align:middle line:84%
and I think you're
around the same.

00:39:18.855 --> 00:39:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: This
is something that's

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.170 align:middle line:90%
been very important to me.

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:26.850 align:middle line:84%
I think that it is
our responsibility

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:29.970 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to
control our minds.

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and to
reach out with our minds.

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:32.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: And to reach out.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.262 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I enjoy reaching out.

00:39:34.262 --> 00:39:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I've had
my own experiences

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:39.840 align:middle line:84%
in more of a laboratory
military setting

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.215 align:middle line:84%
with remote viewing
and all that.

00:39:41.215 --> 00:39:42.173 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:42.173 --> 00:39:43.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's just a way--

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.150 align:middle line:90%
it's all a lab, right?

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:48.510 align:middle line:84%
It's just a way to understand
we can use the mind

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.673 align:middle line:90%
to reach beyond space and time.

00:39:50.673 --> 00:39:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: It
needs to be taught.

00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And should be
taught to kindergartners.

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:54.750 align:middle line:90%
We all have this.

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: It's a
scanning technique.

00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So I do teach every client
that comes into the office,

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:02.610 align:middle line:84%
no matter what they
come into the office

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:05.790 align:middle line:84%
for, whether they want to quit
smoking or inner child work--

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:06.960 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter.

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.790 align:middle line:84%
It's very important
that they learn

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:13.890 align:middle line:84%
how to scan inwards
into the physical body

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:17.780 align:middle line:84%
and create assessment
and evaluation

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:20.730 align:middle line:84%
and begin to feel the
different energy as it moves.

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very important.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: So I'll have
somebody, and anyone at home

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:27.780 align:middle line:84%
can try this, but in a
very relaxed state, taking

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:30.720 align:middle line:84%
a couple of deep breaths,
calming down, settling in,

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.460 align:middle line:90%
settling down.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:36.750 align:middle line:84%
If you move the mind, say,
into the soles of the feet,

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:41.130 align:middle line:84%
focus the mind into the
feet in a gentle way,

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:44.430 align:middle line:84%
you'll begin to feel
a stirring of energy

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:47.070 align:middle line:84%
as the mind and
the body connect.

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:50.340 align:middle line:84%
The feet are a good place as a
starting point because then you

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:53.850 align:middle line:90%
can begin to move the energy up.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:56.210 align:middle line:84%
So I teach people
how to do that.

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And once you can
internally scan,

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:02.470 align:middle line:84%
you should learn how to
scan your environment.

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:05.310 align:middle line:84%
So you can walk through
your house in the dark

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:10.140 align:middle line:84%
so that you can also
perceive anomalous activity

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:13.170 align:middle line:84%
or anything that's not
supposed to be there.

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:16.170 align:middle line:84%
When you're very good at doing
it within your own environment,

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:20.940 align:middle line:84%
then by all means, with
the appropriate protocols,

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:24.060 align:middle line:90%
then scan out and connect.

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:28.590 align:middle line:84%
But be careful,
because there are many.

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:30.600 align:middle line:84%
The universe is
teeming with life.

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is the thing.

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:32.878 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: We don't
want to connect to--

00:41:32.878 --> 00:41:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have bumbled
into a couple things I

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:36.540 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't have--

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Absolutely.

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.478 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --by
being irresponsible,

00:41:38.478 --> 00:41:42.170 align:middle line:84%
not following any kind of
guidelines, protocols, whatnot.

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, because
they weren't taught back then.

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:47.160 align:middle line:90%
Nobody was teaching them.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not even sure
if Steven Greer really--

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --does
that, if he's--

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:53.625 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He wasn't
teaching any of that, no.

00:41:53.625 --> 00:41:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: There is definitely
a protocol prior to a sky watch

00:41:57.570 --> 00:42:01.590 align:middle line:84%
that you should do so that
you're connecting or bringing

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:02.620 align:middle line:90%
the right one.

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:06.650 align:middle line:84%
So an extraterrestrial-human
relationship,

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:10.160 align:middle line:84%
very important that
your relationship is

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.140 align:middle line:90%
with a higher frequency being.

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:15.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't have anything
to do with the ones that

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:19.940 align:middle line:84%
are in the abductor races
because they're self-serving.

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:23.540 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people ask me all
the time, are they evil?

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:24.380 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:27.500 align:middle line:84%
It seems that way
because you're so

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:29.270 align:middle line:84%
afraid of what they're
doing, and they're

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:30.712 align:middle line:90%
harvesting genetics.

00:42:30.712 --> 00:42:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, imagine
what a chimpanzee

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.010 align:middle line:90%
must feel about humans.

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Evil.

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:36.650 align:middle line:90%
They're evil now.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: But the
scientist's intent

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.640 align:middle line:84%
and his agenda is
scientifically based.

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: And they're trying.

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.380 align:middle line:84%
However, though, I
think that, especially

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:52.040 align:middle line:84%
with the gray hybridization
program, I believe that part

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:55.670 align:middle line:84%
or most of that is for
one particular reason.

00:42:55.670 --> 00:43:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Grays live for 700 to 900
years, and then they die.

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.230 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, a human-- and
hue is a measurement.

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:10.910 align:middle line:84%
It's the word we use to measure
the saturation or the depth

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:12.500 align:middle line:90%
of light.

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Man is short for
manifestation, which

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:19.250 align:middle line:84%
is to come into the
physical or to be embodied.

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:22.730 align:middle line:84%
A human is a light
and body being.

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Race and gender
are subcategories

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:27.270 align:middle line:90%
of the definition of human.

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And when you understand
what you are,

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:33.230 align:middle line:84%
you're more capable
of understanding

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:36.560 align:middle line:84%
purpose and mission,
multi-dimensionality,

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:42.200 align:middle line:84%
and your ability to use the mind
to transcend time and space.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Time only on this
planet is linear.

00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:51.270 align:middle line:84%
But the mind is like
a spiral of energy.

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:52.520 align:middle line:90%
And it goes up and down.

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.750 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is actually linear.

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Everything is some sort of
spiral or sphere of energy,

00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:59.510 align:middle line:90%
it seems to me.

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:02.732 align:middle line:90%
And this is how they begin to--

00:44:02.732 --> 00:44:05.190 align:middle line:84%
this is how we begin
to connect moving up

00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:07.673 align:middle line:90%
into that spiral of energy.

00:44:07.673 --> 00:44:09.840 align:middle line:84%
We want to connect with the
higher frequency beings.

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:13.870 align:middle line:84%
The other ones, they're not
evil, they just don't care.

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:14.850 align:middle line:90%
They're self-serving.

00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you say the
hybridization program itself,

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:19.710 align:middle line:90%
is that to be able to--

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Hijack--

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, hijack
those capabilities.

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:22.957 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: --our ascension.

00:44:22.957 --> 00:44:23.757 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:23.757 --> 00:44:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Hijack
our ascension.

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:25.980 align:middle line:90%
They die.

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:30.150 align:middle line:84%
We incarnate or reincarnate,
come back into the flesh,

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:34.530 align:middle line:84%
either here or elsewhere, maybe
even another dimension, maybe

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:35.550 align:middle line:90%
on another planet.

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:38.670 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness
is-- our consciousness

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:43.290 align:middle line:84%
as manifested through light
into this particular vessel

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:45.820 align:middle line:90%
is only for experience.

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:46.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible through
the hybridization program

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:53.160 align:middle line:84%
that the human side
actually is the one that

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:54.935 align:middle line:90%
transcends and transforms--

00:44:54.935 --> 00:44:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: It is
the human part.

00:44:56.310 --> 00:44:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that DNA
and is able to take

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.980 align:middle line:84%
the hybridized, including
the other species,

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.313 align:middle line:84%
into this state
of transcendence.

00:45:04.313 --> 00:45:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: That's
what they want.

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of the
hybrids don't live long.

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:10.920 align:middle line:90%
There's issues with their lungs.

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.960 align:middle line:90%
They don't develop correctly.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And the hybrids weren't
living past 12 years old.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And now, this is from a
being that lives 700 to 900,

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:23.970 align:middle line:84%
and us maybe 80-ish,
some longer, some less.

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:26.340 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that
they're trying

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.835 align:middle line:84%
to piggyback the ascension,
trying to have basically

00:45:29.835 --> 00:45:33.250 align:middle line:90%
an eternal soul that we have.

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:38.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about they're so
superior with their technology.

00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:39.870 align:middle line:90%
We don't care about technology.

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:42.150 align:middle line:90%
That will come in time.

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:45.480 align:middle line:84%
That will come in time in
its natural progression.

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.382 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the unique
spiritual state of the human--

00:45:48.382 --> 00:45:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Is forever.

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is forever, exactly.

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: And is already here.

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:55.680 align:middle line:84%
But like we were saying
earlier, we're not taught.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:58.620 align:middle line:84%
We're not taught how to
use our mind, our body.

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:01.200 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand
the spirit's energy

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:06.390 align:middle line:84%
as a catalyst to propel us
into an expanded consciousness

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:11.090 align:middle line:84%
where we can understand
why we're here.

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of theories calling
our beautiful planet a prison

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:16.680 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I hate that.

00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: I reject that--

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:19.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I totally
reject that with you.

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: --with every fiber.

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is such--

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:23.975 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Nonsense.

00:46:23.975 --> 00:46:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --dark thinking--

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: It's nonsense.

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --and nonsense.

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Just nonsense.

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:28.915 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
I agree with you.

00:46:28.915 --> 00:46:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: This is a
beautiful garden planet

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:35.100 align:middle line:84%
of abundance in a
series of garden planets

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:37.200 align:middle line:90%
through the parallel universe.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:40.570 align:middle line:84%
There are multiple
third-dimensional realities.

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And so when the human
leaves the vessel, the body,

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:48.750 align:middle line:84%
we can continue out
into another place,

00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:51.390 align:middle line:84%
or we can come back into another
third-dimensional reality--

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:54.158 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --or even this
same third-dimensional reality.

00:46:54.158 --> 00:46:55.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's choice.

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: There is a choice.

00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:59.170 align:middle line:90%
You might get tricked.

00:46:59.170 --> 00:46:59.970 align:middle line:90%
You have to--

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:01.345 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Possibly
along the way.

00:47:01.345 --> 00:47:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: --be educated.

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:06.570 align:middle line:84%
"Go to the light" not
always the best advice.

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:10.050 align:middle line:84%
There are some deceptions
in that as well.

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:13.950 align:middle line:84%
But understanding
the self, integrating

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:17.280 align:middle line:84%
the different aspects of
our individual psyches,

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:21.540 align:middle line:84%
and then beginning to
explore the outer realms,

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:25.620 align:middle line:84%
beginning to cultivate
relationships

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:27.510 align:middle line:90%
with extraterrestrials.

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:31.590 align:middle line:84%
The relationships that people
are having right now are wrong.

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:32.940 align:middle line:90%
They're all about sex.

00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:34.570 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's coming to me.

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:36.360 align:middle line:90%
I've had sex with a reptilian.

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I've had sex with a
beautiful Pleiadian.

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's so good, I
just can't say no.

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like,
sorry, just say no.

00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:47.213 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, Nancy Reagan, but--

00:47:47.213 --> 00:47:48.013 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:47:48.013 --> 00:47:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, you've
just got to say no.

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:50.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So this is a theme.

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: This
is a real thing.

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.450 align:middle line:90%
This is a real thing.

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's going back to the
'30s and '40s, where there was

00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.835 align:middle line:90%
intercourse with--

00:47:59.835 --> 00:48:00.635 align:middle line:90%
can I say that?

00:48:00.635 --> 00:48:01.435 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:01.435 --> 00:48:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
you can say that.

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:05.150 align:middle line:90%
It's in the anatomy and the--

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: OK.

00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:12.590 align:middle line:84%
So they're having engagement
with the extraterrestrials.

00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, there was a man
that I regressed a little bit

00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:17.890 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:20.480 align:middle line:90%
And he's older.

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.400 align:middle line:90%
He's in his 70s.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And he used to live down the
road from Beale Air Force Base.

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:32.190 align:middle line:84%
There's a little gas
station cafe/bar.

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:34.950 align:middle line:90%
His mom and dad ran that place.

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And he would pump gas, fill
tires, wipe the bar down.

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.040 align:middle line:90%
He was a young guy.

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.183 align:middle line:84%
He'd sometimes work
with his mom late.

00:48:43.183 --> 00:48:45.600 align:middle line:84%
But all the time, they'd have
to bring the garbage way out

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.780 align:middle line:84%
into the back, and they'd
watch for the planes to come.

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And for several summers, his
family watched them chase UFOs.

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There were a
lot sightings and activity

00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:58.710 align:middle line:90%
over Beale.

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:01.043 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, there's a
huge underground base there.

00:49:01.043 --> 00:49:02.643 align:middle line:84%
They brought Cheney
there on 9/11.

00:49:02.643 --> 00:49:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I didn't know
that, and that's right

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:05.550 align:middle line:90%
in our backyard--

00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:05.995 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, huge--

00:49:05.995 --> 00:49:06.953 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --both of us.

00:49:06.953 --> 00:49:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Huge underground
base right there.

00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:11.100 align:middle line:90%
And his family grew up--

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:13.723 align:middle line:84%
the base probably ran right
underneath the gas station.

00:49:13.723 --> 00:49:14.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, that explains a lot of
the phenomena out of there,

00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:20.825 align:middle line:84%
and even these wild,
deep, guttural sounds

00:49:20.825 --> 00:49:21.700 align:middle line:90%
coming from the area.

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Oh, absolutely.

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:24.003 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Because we hear those.

00:49:24.003 --> 00:49:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah,
that's the base.

00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, he said one night a
beautiful, breathtaking woman

00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:38.710 align:middle line:84%
walked through his
wall with a gray.

00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And they were expected to
have sexual relations, which

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:46.470 align:middle line:90%
I believe he did.

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, he had
suppressed this for--

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:50.700 align:middle line:90%
he didn't suppress it.

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:51.620 align:middle line:90%
He was aware of it.

00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:54.870 align:middle line:84%
He just didn't talk
about it for decades.

00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And then he was
diagnosed with cancer

00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:59.430 align:middle line:90%
and created a bucket list.

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And on that bucket
list was to come

00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:08.580 align:middle line:84%
to a hypnotherapist's office and
find out exactly what happened.

00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And he was compelling,
emotional, real.

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:20.395 align:middle line:84%
And this was back before
the Betty and Barney Hill.

00:50:20.395 --> 00:50:22.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, before it was
a phenomena you read about.

00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:23.978 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, absolutely.

00:50:23.978 --> 00:50:28.860 align:middle line:84%
So he had no information
to draw from.

00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:31.440 align:middle line:90%
These are his experiences.

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And he carried them
his entire life.

00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:35.820 align:middle line:90%
And there's a stigma.

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Like my own mother, she
never spoke it again.

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:43.650 align:middle line:84%
She wrote it down,
she shut it down,

00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:47.640 align:middle line:84%
and she tried to pretend
it didn't happen.

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:51.660 align:middle line:84%
So here we have this-- this
is one common phenomena,

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:54.090 align:middle line:90%
is sexual relations with ETs.

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD:
Especially reptilians.

00:50:55.570 --> 00:50:57.800 align:middle line:84%
They're very interested
in our sexuality.

00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that was Barbara
Lamb's story as well, that she

00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:03.480 align:middle line:84%
had a relationship
and an actual marriage

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.850 align:middle line:84%
in another dimension
with a reptilian male.

00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, and also
Simon over in the UK believes

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:12.253 align:middle line:90%
he's got a--

00:51:12.253 --> 00:51:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Simon Parks?

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Simon Parks, yeah.

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:16.020 align:middle line:90%
He has a ET family.

00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:18.400 align:middle line:90%
And so this isn't uncommon.

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:18.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Not uncommon.

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some
high-profile people

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:23.640 align:middle line:84%
have been sharing this
information for a while.

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:26.650 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'm-- so let's
not even go there,

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:29.240 align:middle line:84%
because it's kind of specific
to those individuals.

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:30.900 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at the larger effect.

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:32.275 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah,
everybody now--

00:51:32.275 --> 00:51:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is
this all about?

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:35.728 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, I
know that a lot of it

00:51:35.728 --> 00:51:37.830 align:middle line:84%
is psychological
understanding of

00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:42.180 align:middle line:84%
the human, desire-driven
tendencies and so forth,

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:43.480 align:middle line:90%
understanding us.

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, they use that
information to manipulate us.

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:50.320 align:middle line:84%
No different than
what I'm doing.

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:54.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing psychological
profiling on them,

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:57.330 align:middle line:84%
to be honest, to find their
weakness so that I can exploit

00:51:57.330 --> 00:52:00.420 align:middle line:84%
it, so that when we have
that face-to-face, eye-to-eye

00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:02.910 align:middle line:84%
contact with an
extraterrestrial,

00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:05.930 align:middle line:84%
we're leveling the playing
field just a little bit.

00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:07.500 align:middle line:90%
We really need to do that.

00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:09.330 align:middle line:90%
We've been the underdog.

00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:11.430 align:middle line:90%
We're the infants here.

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And now that we're
growing up, some of us

00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:19.410 align:middle line:84%
more aware than others,
we have to understand

00:52:19.410 --> 00:52:23.550 align:middle line:84%
their intent, their
agendas, and, unfortunately,

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:24.870 align:middle line:90%
their weakness.

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:27.920 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand their
weakness so that we can use it.

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:28.720 align:middle line:90%
So if you're--

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What is a weakness?

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.053 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Well, praying mant--

00:52:31.053 --> 00:52:34.020 align:middle line:84%
or the mantis beings, for
instance, being so hive

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:38.453 align:middle line:84%
minded, what they fear is
being away from the hive.

00:52:38.453 --> 00:52:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So being
separated out--

00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Being separate.

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --into
individual situations.

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Individual
is the word.

00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:46.140 align:middle line:84%
They cannot stand
the individuality.

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:48.610 align:middle line:84%
That just freaks them
out beyond belief.

00:52:48.610 --> 00:52:51.080 align:middle line:84%
So you find yourself
with a mantis,

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.160 align:middle line:90%
and you are an individual.

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.350 align:middle line:84%
You're a strong, you're
an empowered person.

00:52:55.350 --> 00:52:56.820 align:middle line:90%
You speak your mind.

00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:59.550 align:middle line:84%
When they do that intense
stare, they look so deeply

00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:04.230 align:middle line:84%
into your eyes as if they could
read your soul, you can like--

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:05.640 align:middle line:90%
and push them back.

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.710 align:middle line:84%
You could only do
that if you're feeling

00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:11.010 align:middle line:90%
very strong and empowered.

00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:13.222 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, most
people, when they--

00:53:13.222 --> 00:53:14.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Are too frightened.

00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:15.722 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Are too frightened.

00:53:15.722 --> 00:53:18.240 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be able
to learn how to control

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:20.200 align:middle line:90%
your emotional energy.

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:23.340 align:middle line:84%
In fact, practicing
equanimity is

00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:26.490 align:middle line:84%
important for whatever your
experiences are in life so

00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:34.110 align:middle line:84%
that you can be non-reactive and
logical in your thought process

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:37.650 align:middle line:84%
so that you can make the right
decisions that aren't based

00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:42.870 align:middle line:84%
on an instant of energetic
burst of fear, insecurity,

00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:44.670 align:middle line:90%
whatever it may be.

00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:48.930 align:middle line:84%
So equanimity, the
ability to be like that,

00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:53.190 align:middle line:84%
is what you'll need when you're
in the presence of an ET.

00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:54.930 align:middle line:90%
They don't worry me.

00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:56.670 align:middle line:90%
They don't scare me.

00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:57.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm just like this.

00:53:57.810 --> 00:53:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:58.610 --> 00:53:59.205 align:middle line:90%
You're you.

00:53:59.205 --> 00:54:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: You know that.

00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:01.842 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But most
people, they're not you.

00:54:01.842 --> 00:54:03.640 align:middle line:90%
They're not prepared for this.

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Now let's-- we only
have a few minutes left.

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Wow.

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I know.

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:07.960 align:middle line:90%
It flew.

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:10.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you're dealing
with, say, a little gray,

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:11.850 align:middle line:90%
what is their weakness?

00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well,
the little gray,

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:18.070 align:middle line:90%
they've got like zero power.

00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:21.910 align:middle line:84%
The second you stop the
program, they're done.

00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:24.620 align:middle line:90%
They cannot do anything else.

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:27.100 align:middle line:84%
So the moment you are
no longer compliant--

00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:28.150 align:middle line:90%
so they have an ability--

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I think they use I want to
say like a delta transmission,

00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:35.290 align:middle line:84%
where they take the delta
brainwave and the theta

00:54:35.290 --> 00:54:39.400 align:middle line:84%
brainwave and simulate a
sleep state within us that

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:40.930 align:middle line:90%
creates a compliance.

00:54:40.930 --> 00:54:43.270 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's a
loophole in allowing

00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:46.600 align:middle line:84%
them to abduct us because
they're really not allowed to.

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:47.955 align:middle line:90%
But we go willingly.

00:54:47.955 --> 00:54:50.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because
you're in that theta state.

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:51.788 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Because
you're in that state.

00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:53.830 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a manipulation.

00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:57.800 align:middle line:84%
But if for some reason you break
yourself out of that state--

00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:59.342 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Say, hey,
knock it off, no.

00:54:59.342 --> 00:55:01.883 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --what you want to
do is be able to wake yourself

00:55:01.883 --> 00:55:03.085 align:middle line:90%
up, become fully lucid--

00:55:03.085 --> 00:55:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Boom.

00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --and conscious,
being in the beta brainwave,

00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:06.450 align:middle line:90%
and then just look at them.

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:07.617 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what you do.

00:55:07.617 --> 00:55:09.284 align:middle line:84%
They'll instantly
call in a taller gray.

00:55:09.284 --> 00:55:11.742 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then what happens
when the taller gray comes?

00:55:11.742 --> 00:55:13.120 align:middle line:90%
What's their weakness?

00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:16.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, their weakness
is the same thing, actually.

00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:17.600 align:middle line:90%
It's very similar.

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:20.680 align:middle line:84%
They're all hive-minded
to a certain degree.

00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:23.500 align:middle line:84%
But when you tell
them that you're

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:27.250 align:middle line:84%
violating my human rights
and that you're not

00:55:27.250 --> 00:55:29.350 align:middle line:84%
allowed to do this,
they must back down.

00:55:29.350 --> 00:55:31.238 align:middle line:90%
And the reptilians will too.

00:55:31.238 --> 00:55:32.530 align:middle line:90%
Now, the reptilian psychology--

00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, let's
talk about them,

00:55:33.370 --> 00:55:35.412 align:middle line:84%
because everyone says
they're a little different.

00:55:35.412 --> 00:55:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, they're
highly regimented.

00:55:37.450 --> 00:55:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And that is our power because
they take commands very easily.

00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:48.370 align:middle line:84%
So if you can put yourself
in a position of commanding

00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:50.950 align:middle line:84%
and telling them, you
know what, I outrank you,

00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:53.350 align:middle line:84%
basically-- that's
what it has to be.

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:54.670 align:middle line:90%
You have to outrank them.

00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
they literally

00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:00.580 align:middle line:84%
do this little bow thing,
and you're free to go.

00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:02.050 align:middle line:90%
That's how I take it.

00:56:02.050 --> 00:56:03.008 align:middle line:90%
You're free to go.

00:56:03.008 --> 00:56:04.300 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you have to do.

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they respond
to command and hierarchy.

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:07.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:08.780 align:middle line:90%
They're totally regimented.

00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:10.420 align:middle line:90%
They can't live without that.

00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:13.100 align:middle line:84%
They have to be told what
to do, when to do it,

00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and how to be continuously--
now, with the reptilians,

00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:18.460 align:middle line:84%
just so you know,
it's the women who

00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:21.200 align:middle line:90%
are the highest, most powerful.

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:22.210 align:middle line:90%
The men work.

00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:24.610 align:middle line:84%
The women are the rulers
within the reptilian

00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:26.290 align:middle line:90%
and the draco reptilian races.

00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:27.957 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
do they want with us?

00:56:27.957 --> 00:56:29.980 align:middle line:90%


00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: They feel
that the planet is theirs

00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:35.640 align:middle line:84%
and that they were here
first and that there

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:39.600 align:middle line:84%
were wars that happened
and that we actually took

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:41.130 align:middle line:90%
something that wasn't ours.

00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:43.213 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
interesting because they have

00:56:43.213 --> 00:56:44.370 align:middle line:90%
been here a very long time.

00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:47.123 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: That's true,
from what we can gather.

00:56:47.123 --> 00:56:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From
what we understand.

00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:51.180 align:middle line:84%
I actually, and I don't know
what your hit on this is,

00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:54.960 align:middle line:84%
but I went on top of
the Bosnian Pyramid,

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:56.550 align:middle line:90%
and I sat there by myself.

00:56:56.550 --> 00:56:58.470 align:middle line:90%
And I just said, what's here?

00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:59.410 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that those
were originally

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:04.823 align:middle line:84%
reptilian constructions
for their own use.

00:57:04.823 --> 00:57:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, I
wouldn't doubt that.

00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:08.032 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
they'd vacated it.

00:57:08.032 --> 00:57:08.910 align:middle line:90%
They'd left long ago.

00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:11.150 align:middle line:84%
They weren't colonizing
the area any longer,

00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:12.470 align:middle line:90%
but that they had been.

00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:14.400 align:middle line:90%
And they actually shut it down.

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I do
you sometimes think

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:23.400 align:middle line:84%
that they have a legitimate
complaint that this land might

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:25.470 align:middle line:84%
be something we
should be sharing.

00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:27.780 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, they did leave.

00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they left.

00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:32.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And they
developed in a different way.

00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And it split among
themselves even.

00:57:35.490 --> 00:57:38.620 align:middle line:84%
The regular reptilians,
the draco reptilians,

00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:39.870 align:middle line:90%
they have different behaviors.

00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:41.550 align:middle line:90%
The dracos didn't stay here.

00:57:41.550 --> 00:57:44.340 align:middle line:84%
It was the other
reptilians that did.

00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:45.520 align:middle line:90%
But they did visit.

00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:48.423 align:middle line:90%
And they are related.

00:57:48.423 --> 00:57:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they have a
beef because they say, hey,

00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:52.320 align:middle line:90%
this is our land too.

00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:53.550 align:middle line:90%
But why interface with us?

00:57:53.550 --> 00:57:55.008 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: But
now-- well, they're

00:57:55.008 --> 00:57:58.710 align:middle line:84%
very interested in the
psychology of how we developed.

00:57:58.710 --> 00:58:01.890 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I recall
them saying something

00:58:01.890 --> 00:58:05.950 align:middle line:84%
like they're shocked at the
population of the planet

00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:07.620 align:middle line:90%
because we're like rabbits.

00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:10.170 align:middle line:84%
We populated the
planet so quickly.

00:58:10.170 --> 00:58:11.970 align:middle line:90%
That's what shocked them.

00:58:11.970 --> 00:58:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I can only
assume that they

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:19.890 align:middle line:84%
don't procreate at the
same rate that we do right.

00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And all of the ETs all
have their own stuff.

00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And just because they
have more technology

00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:26.485 align:middle line:90%
does not make them superior.

00:58:26.485 --> 00:58:27.285 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:58:27.285 --> 00:58:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: They're not gods.

00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:30.360 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to save us.

00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:33.150 align:middle line:84%
We will save ourselves
when the time is right.

00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:34.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You and I
are on the same page.

00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:37.888 align:middle line:84%
And we should never put down
what it is to be a human.

00:58:37.888 --> 00:58:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: That's right.

00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:40.555 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
we're one of the most

00:58:40.555 --> 00:58:45.280 align:middle line:84%
interesting, sublime, confused,
amnesiac species out there,

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:46.080 align:middle line:90%
perhaps.

00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:49.142 align:middle line:84%
But our potential for
love, creativity--

00:58:49.142 --> 00:58:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Phenomenal.

00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:51.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --is phenomenal.

00:58:51.450 --> 00:58:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: That's what we are.

00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is a garden of Eden--

00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: We're
great manifesters.

00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --if we
quit trashing her.

00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:57.060 align:middle line:90%
This is the deal.

00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:00.990 align:middle line:84%
We are co-creators of
this particular reality.

00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Everything in this studio,
everything you're wearing,

00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:08.430 align:middle line:84%
everything I'm wearing, these
are man-made, manufactured,

00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:12.220 align:middle line:84%
manifested from the
human thought process.

00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:13.260 align:middle line:90%
This is what we do.

00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:16.380 align:middle line:84%
We co-create, and
we're powerful beings.

00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:20.280 align:middle line:10%
And the number one
commonality among all

00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:24.180 align:middle line:10%
of the extraterrestrial races
is their interest in us.

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:29.520 align:middle line:84%
We're a fascinating hybrid
species of our own kind, spirit

00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:30.692 align:middle line:90%
and flesh merging.

00:59:30.692 --> 00:59:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: We're
quite the reality show.

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We are indeed.

quick thought you have?

00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:37.593 align:middle line:90%
Because we're out of time.

00:59:37.593 --> 00:59:38.393 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: No.

00:59:38.393 --> 00:59:39.540 align:middle line:90%
It's been just lovely.

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:39.900 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Regina.

00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:40.650 align:middle line:90%

so we'll tell them where to go.

00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:45.650 align:middle line:90%
OK?
