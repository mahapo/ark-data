>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Sometimes we all

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.060 align:middle line:10%
need a leg up when it comes
to the day-to-day decisions

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.780 align:middle line:10%
in life, even when it comes
to knowing our own deeper

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:10%
motivations.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.020 align:middle line:84%
This is where divination
tools come into play.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Paul Wagner is with us today
with his new book and deck

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.290 align:middle line:84%
of cards titled "The Field
Guide to Human Personality."

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.050 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
how he developed his system,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.590 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to do a live
reading a little bit later on

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.560 align:middle line:84%
and see how this
all works firsthand.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.393 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL WAGNER: Cool.

00:00:53.393 --> 00:00:53.900 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have quite
an interesting background.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you went from kind
of techie computer geek,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.370 align:middle line:90%
to comedian actor, to now sage.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you'd take a
little time and just--

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.300 align:middle line:90%
we want to know who you are.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Well, thank you.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.475 align:middle line:10%
First of all, I'm excited
to be on your show.

00:01:12.475 --> 00:01:13.150 align:middle line:10%
This is lovely.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.910 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.618 align:middle line:10%
>>WAGNER: I've been
very, very fortunate.

00:01:15.618 --> 00:01:17.200 align:middle line:10%
I've had quite a
remarkable journey.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.420 align:middle line:10%
I was at Xerox after I was at,
first of all, Boston College.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.920 align:middle line:84%
I studied computer
science and math.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.820 align:middle line:84%
But I took a job at Xerox,
and a few months in, there

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.880 align:middle line:84%
was a new secretary
at the front desk,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.550 align:middle line:90%
and I was always very friendly.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And I came in and I said
hello, and it turns out,

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.120 align:middle line:84%
she was a psychic
filling in for somebody,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:84%
and she immediately said,
you're in the wrong job

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.655 align:middle line:84%
and you have to exit
quickly in order

00:01:39.655 --> 00:01:41.840 align:middle line:90%
to get on a new life trajectory.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.746 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How lucky.

00:01:42.746 --> 00:01:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.995 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was kind
of a little shocked.

00:01:44.995 --> 00:01:47.080 align:middle line:84%
I was like, uh, could
I get a cup of coffee?

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Can I-- is it OK if
I just-- you know.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.610 align:middle line:84%
So I had to make a quick
change, and I said, well,

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:53.620 align:middle line:90%
what do you recommend?

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And she said, there is
a healer named Karmu.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.260 align:middle line:84%
An African healer living in
Harvard Square in Cambridge.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.365 align:middle line:90%
She goes, go see him.

00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:02.365 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, little did
you know she said that

00:02:02.365 --> 00:02:03.615 align:middle line:90%
to everyone that walked in.

00:02:03.615 --> 00:02:03.820 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: I'll bet.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.970 align:middle line:90%
It's totally possible.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I'm teasing.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.009 align:middle line:90%
So Karmu.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.407 align:middle line:90%
So pick up the story.

00:02:09.407 --> 00:02:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yes.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.700 align:middle line:84%
I was very, very
lucky that I didn't

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.202 align:middle line:84%
have much to do that day, so
I literally packed my stuff up

00:02:14.202 --> 00:02:15.660 align:middle line:84%
and I went right
to Harvard Square.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Seriously?

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: And I went
to meet this guy.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You quit
your job that day?

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: No.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.600 align:middle line:90%
Not just yet.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: No, but I took my
stuff that I came in with.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.900 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.191 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: And I went
to see this man.

00:02:24.191 --> 00:02:26.760 align:middle line:84%
He was this lovely older
man in his late '80s,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.410 align:middle line:84%
and as I approached the place,
I saw all these shoes out front,

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.580 align:middle line:84%
and they were doing
a documentary on him.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.655 align:middle line:84%
And they had unearthed
the fact that this man

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:38.650 align:middle line:84%
had healed all these people
of thousands of things.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they had these books
filled with testimonials.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And I walked in, and the
film crew was wrapping up.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me and
he said, Paul, please sit.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And so immediately, I got this
guy was somewhat intuitive.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.970 align:middle line:90%
And I sat on this large pillow.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.100 align:middle line:84%
He put his hand on my lower
spine, I saw the light of God,

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.643 align:middle line:90%
and I passed out.

00:03:00.643 --> 00:03:01.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: I was out.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And when I woke up, he
was holding my hand,

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.460 align:middle line:84%
and he had a cup of
tea for me, and he

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.870 align:middle line:84%
said, let me tell you a
story about a man who's

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.670 align:middle line:84%
gonna leave a company that
he's no longer happy at,

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.060 align:middle line:84%
and he's gonna go on
a magnificent journey,

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.734 align:middle line:84%
and he'll be on stages,
and he'll be writing,

00:03:18.734 --> 00:03:20.150 align:middle line:84%
and he'll be on
TV, and it's gonna

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.475 align:middle line:90%
be a really exciting journey.

00:03:21.475 --> 00:03:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And he said, this man is
you, and it begins very soon.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.060 align:middle line:90%
And I just exploded in tears.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, yeah,
that sounds so right.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.910 align:middle line:90%
So I literally didn't have to--

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So me.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.308 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: It was.

00:03:32.308 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And so the next
day, I quit, and I

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:90%
auditioned for a comedy troupe.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.752 align:middle line:90%
I got in the troop.

00:03:37.752 --> 00:03:39.460 align:middle line:84%
They were about to go
on a national tour.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.310 align:middle line:90%
I ended up on a national tour.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And I came back, auditioned
for one show-- a kids' TV show.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.830 align:middle line:90%
I landed the show.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.925 align:middle line:84%
Everything happened so
quickly, but it was, I think,

00:03:48.925 --> 00:03:51.050 align:middle line:84%
because I was in the right
place at the right time,

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.732 align:middle line:90%
and I said yes.

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You said yes.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.120 align:middle line:90%
And then you went back later.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.330 align:middle line:90%
The plot thickens, right?

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.784 align:middle line:84%
And you found out, there never
was a substitute secretary.

00:03:58.784 --> 00:03:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Right.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.949 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:01.450 align:middle line:90%
The building never existed.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.585 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:02.585 --> 00:04:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:84%
So the substitute secretary
slash psychic really

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.250 align:middle line:90%
changed your life.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: She did.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.930 align:middle line:84%
She really-- it
shifted everything.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And she was so intense, it
was like you have to hear me.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like she had
this stake in it.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.670 align:middle line:84%
But it was very fortunate that--
it's very wonderful when people

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.430 align:middle line:84%
show up in your life,
and they give you

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.890 align:middle line:90%
a nice piece of information.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.496 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At the exact
moment you can still hear it.

00:04:26.496 --> 00:04:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.410 align:middle line:90%
And then you can do something.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.410 align:middle line:90%
You can make a decision.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.140 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So OK.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.610 align:middle line:84%
Had you already had
background in comedy,

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.259 align:middle line:84%
or acting, or
anything like that?

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: No.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.135 align:middle line:90%
I had never done anything.

00:04:37.135 --> 00:04:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Anything until the day that
I walked on that stage.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.176 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, come on.

00:04:40.176 --> 00:04:40.990 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is scary.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.730 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
everybody's greatest fear

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.530 align:middle line:84%
is having to go out
and inspire an audience

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.180 align:middle line:90%
to laugh in standup comedy.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.680 align:middle line:90%
I mean.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.170 align:middle line:90%
It was painful.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's gutsy.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, it wasn't perfect.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not gonna
say I was a rock star.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.547 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No one laughed.

00:04:53.547 --> 00:04:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: It's very
hard to start in comedy.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.120 align:middle line:84%
But it eventually
grew, and to the point

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.100 align:middle line:84%
that I wrote my
own one-man shows.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.360 align:middle line:90%
I took them around the world.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.660 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of success on
stages all over the world.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.500 align:middle line:84%
I tried very hard to get my show
in a really good theater in New

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.010 align:middle line:90%
York.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.260 align:middle line:90%
It was just way too expensive.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:84%
But by that time, I had a great
following doing custom shows

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.760 align:middle line:84%
for corporations, where
I'd learn about the company

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.020 align:middle line:90%
and deliver comedy shows.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, it was very
intense and somewhat disruptive

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.090 align:middle line:84%
for them, because Id' be trying
to tell the truth, in a way.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: So that was-- I was
arrested a couple of times.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How'd that happen?

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: You know,
I was in my late 20s,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.840 align:middle line:84%
so I was full of fire,
and a lot of arrogance,

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.270 align:middle line:84%
and thought it
was my job to let,

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.867 align:middle line:84%
for instance, Pfizer, know
what I felt about them.

00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:43.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, give
us-- you don't have

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:44.770 align:middle line:90%
to perform a comedy routine.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe just give us
the bullet points.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: I'll give you
just a tiny little glimpse.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.300 align:middle line:84%
I did their 150th anniversary
in Montreal, Canada.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.220 align:middle line:90%
Thousands of people.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the stage, and
I had written a script.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And the way I did my shows is,
I play characters on a screen,

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.970 align:middle line:84%
and then I talk to
those characters.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's comedy in the
narrative and the discussion,

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.538 align:middle line:84%
and then I do a
little bit of stand

00:06:05.538 --> 00:06:09.947 align:middle line:84%
up in between these interactive
sketches, basically.

00:06:09.947 --> 00:06:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And I basically opened the
show with seven minutes

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.950 align:middle line:84%
of stand up, which went
pretty strong, pretty well,

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.820 align:middle line:84%
and then I went live
to a Catholic priest,

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.085 align:middle line:84%
and I confessed all of
Pfizer's sins to the priest.

00:06:22.085 --> 00:06:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oops.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: And when I
looked up at the audience,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.758 align:middle line:90%
the audience was like--

00:06:25.758 --> 00:06:26.258 align:middle line:90%
[CROAKING]

00:06:26.258 --> 00:06:27.841 align:middle line:84%
You know, because
they'd been drinking

00:06:27.841 --> 00:06:29.995 align:middle line:84%
the Kool-Aid about what
they felt Pfizer was.

00:06:29.995 --> 00:06:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did you find
out what their sins were?

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.686 align:middle line:84%
Or was this just something
that anyone could kind of

00:06:33.686 --> 00:06:34.550 align:middle line:90%
piece together?

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.474 align:middle line:84%
Did you have a little
insider information?

00:06:36.474 --> 00:06:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: I did.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You did your research.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.680 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: I did a lot.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.150 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of research
for these shows.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.066 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh goodness.

00:06:41.066 --> 00:06:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: And the woman who was
in charge of a human resources

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.090 align:middle line:84%
and sales hiring, who was
my guide into the company

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.450 align:middle line:84%
and exploring the
show, it turns out she

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.250 align:middle line:84%
was having a little
bit of a midlife crisis

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and awakening about
her own experience

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:57.510 align:middle line:90%
in corporate culture.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.220 align:middle line:84%
So I was really somewhat
living her dream

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.630 align:middle line:90%
of confronting her company.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.700 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't know it.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.830 align:middle line:84%
But that's-- so you know,
they eventually had to shut

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.839 align:middle line:84%
the screens down, and my mic
was dead, and the police came.

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, they
gave you the hook.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.546 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: I had to come off.

00:07:11.546 --> 00:07:12.279 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:13.320 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: I was escorted.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You got
escorted out by police?

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: Two policemen,
and they escorted me

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.380 align:middle line:90%
off the property.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.421 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, now, that's--
it's not a criminal--

00:07:20.421 --> 00:07:22.035 align:middle line:90%
it's not a crime to--

00:07:22.035 --> 00:07:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Private property.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:23.830 align:middle line:90%
Turns out.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.805 align:middle line:84%
Private property,
you're unwanted,

00:07:25.805 --> 00:07:26.930 align:middle line:90%
you must leave immediately.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
they wanted to do--

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.338 align:middle line:84%
I assume this is what they
wanted to do-- they wanted

00:07:30.338 --> 00:07:33.410 align:middle line:84%
to find a way to
demonstrate to the audience

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.879 align:middle line:84%
the extreme that I'd gone to
share some information was

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:38.920 align:middle line:90%
completely inappropriate.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.905 align:middle line:84%
I think it was for
the audience's effect.

00:07:40.905 --> 00:07:41.710 align:middle line:90%
But it was--

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I wonder
what happened afterward

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.672 align:middle line:90%
in the wake of all if that.

00:07:44.672 --> 00:07:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: I know.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.924 align:middle line:84%
All I know is I got a nice
check, so I'm happy with it.

00:07:47.924 --> 00:07:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, that's cool.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:50.821 align:middle line:84%
And besides, the
pharmaceutical companies

00:07:50.821 --> 00:07:53.070 align:middle line:84%
have kind of shown their own
true colors over the time

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.550 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: They really have,
so it's worked out for me.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:55.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:55.730 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:56.640 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.130 align:middle line:84%
So now at what point
did you begin in life

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:04.230 align:middle line:84%
your journeys of the more kind
of sacred, mystical practices.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: Well, as I was doing
these shows-- you know when you

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.155 align:middle line:84%
have a show, people
just come up to you

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:10.240 align:middle line:84%
and they just start
talking to you.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And I was very lucky to have
people just show up in my life,

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.090 align:middle line:84%
because I had this-- the
audition that I went on

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.590 align:middle line:84%
after leaving Xerox is
I had my own kids TV

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.504 align:middle line:84%
show for a bunch
of years in Boston.

00:08:19.504 --> 00:08:20.920 align:middle line:84%
So people would
just come up to me

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.910 align:middle line:90%
and just invite me to things.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.445 align:middle line:90%
And somebody invited me to see--

00:08:24.445 --> 00:08:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was your
name on your TV show?

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: Oh, it was
just Paul Wagner.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:27.642 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:08:27.642 --> 00:08:28.280 align:middle line:90%
It was Paul Wagner?

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah, just me.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You used
your own name.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: I did.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And I had a lovely co-host
named Elizabeth Dann,

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.520 align:middle line:90%
and it was a very sweet show.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.600 align:middle line:90%
It was awesome.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.650 align:middle line:90%
It was so lovely.

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:39.809 align:middle line:84%
But someone said to go
see this woman Amma, known

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:40.960 align:middle line:90%
as the Hugging Saint.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Ammachi.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.510 align:middle line:90%
This was 30 years ago.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:44.135 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:44.135 --> 00:08:44.930 align:middle line:90%
She's so popular.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Huge.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.020 align:middle line:90%
She's quite a remarkable soul.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.144 align:middle line:90%
And so I went to see her.

00:08:49.144 --> 00:08:50.310 align:middle line:90%
She was in this little room.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:52.190 align:middle line:90%
There were 10 people in there.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:53.690 align:middle line:90%
I walk in the door.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.490 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't even handle
the intense vibration.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.110 align:middle line:84%
I'd never seen
anything like this.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.530 align:middle line:90%
This beautiful soul.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And I just started
sobbing, and I

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.940 align:middle line:90%
just-- I ended up bowing to her.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.080 align:middle line:90%
I had no--

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Nothing in me had ever
shown me to do that,

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:08.762 align:middle line:90%
but I just remember bowing.

00:09:08.762 --> 00:09:09.970 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't even know what--

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just a reverence
for the incredible quality

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:12.599 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:09:12.599 --> 00:09:13.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:13.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.160 align:middle line:90%
It blew me away.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.250 align:middle line:90%
I can still feel that moment.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:18.900 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.320 align:middle line:90%
And then my life changed.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.950 align:middle line:84%
She eventually asked me to open
for her in different cities,

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:90%
so I started opening--

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Doing comedy?

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:25.215 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:09:25.215 --> 00:09:25.980 align:middle line:90%
She wanted me to--

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do you do
comedy for the hugging saint?

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: Well, it turns out
that, around these masters

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:34.230 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of pretty
wackiness that happens.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.240 align:middle line:84%
When people are going
through a lot, when someone's

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:42.100 align:middle line:84%
burning away thousands of past
lives out of a collective,

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.500 align:middle line:90%
a lot of stuff is happening.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
fodder for comedy.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.971 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for me, it was
really easy to write

00:09:47.971 --> 00:09:51.930 align:middle line:84%
a really fun show which
90% of the people that

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.910 align:middle line:84%
would go thought was wonderful
and was like, wow, comedy here.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:55.410 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And people felt welcome
because it opens them up.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.470 align:middle line:84%
But about, you know, 5% to
10% thought I was Antichrist,

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:04.150 align:middle line:84%
but she asked me to do
it, so that's all I know.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.815 align:middle line:84%
But I did that for
a long, long time,

00:10:05.815 --> 00:10:07.809 align:middle line:90%
and it was quite remarkable.

00:10:07.809 --> 00:10:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so through
that journey you--

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've studied a lot of
different religious traditions

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and modalities of not
just healing, but kind

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.940 align:middle line:84%
of psychic
introspection and such.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.745 align:middle line:84%
So from there, where did you
start really picking up value?

00:10:23.745 --> 00:10:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: I dove deeply into
Native American culture,

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.810 align:middle line:84%
because a native
elder had called me

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.940 align:middle line:84%
when I had my kids show and said
I'd like you to be my student,

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.140 align:middle line:84%
but you have to want
that as much as I see it.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And he invited me to come
to his house for lunch

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:84%
and I sat with him and I
realized he was right on.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.740 align:middle line:84%
There was a real connection,
and so I brought red cloth

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.380 align:middle line:84%
and tobacco and I asked
him to be my teacher,

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:50.050 align:middle line:84%
and we have this
lovely time together.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.770 align:middle line:84%
His name is Day Lone-Wolf
and he lives in Western mass.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:56.730 align:middle line:84%
He's a jewelry maker, and
a profound, beautiful soul,

00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:84%
and just taught me about
masculinity, how to be a man,

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.180 align:middle line:84%
and how to ground all this
crazy intuition I have.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.770 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
to do with it.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.490 align:middle line:84%
It's images, and I thought
everybody was like this.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:12.120 align:middle line:84%
I honestly thought everybody
could see through each other.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.980 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that
this is something

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.364 align:middle line:90%
I had to contend with, so--

00:11:15.364 --> 00:11:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.752 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: But he showed me.

00:11:17.752 --> 00:11:19.210 align:middle line:84%
He taught me how
to play the flute,

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and his uncle was a
man named Hawk who

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.994 align:middle line:90%
made all of Santana's flutes.

00:11:24.994 --> 00:11:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, this man
made me this beautiful flute

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.680 align:middle line:84%
from a dream I had,
and it was such a gift.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:34.620 align:middle line:84%
So I learned how to be a pipe
carrier and lead sweat lodges,

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.280 align:middle line:84%
how to build sweat
lodges, and then

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I did a lot of vision quests
in the Pecos Wilderness

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.430 align:middle line:84%
in New Mexico where I
wouldn't have any food

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.290 align:middle line:84%
or anything for about four
days, and I would literally just

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.590 align:middle line:84%
talk to animals, and I
wrestled with a bear.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:50.280 align:middle line:84%
I got deeply into that
culture and the idea

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:84%
of the release of
ego, which is--

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.660 align:middle line:84%
and the release
of all the layers

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:90%
that happens in a sweat lodge.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.520 align:middle line:90%
Sweat lodge is just death.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a beautiful
dying experience.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:11:59.735 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well yeah.

00:11:59.735 --> 00:12:02.300 align:middle line:84%
You're talking to someone
from Sedona, touchy subject.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Oh, you know.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah that's where all
that craziness happened.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that wasn't good.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Very--

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But no, I
know what you mean.

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:08.690 align:middle line:84%
It takes people to the
edge of a lot of things.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: It does, it does.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in the
right environment,

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.180 align:middle line:84%
you actually end up having
a pretty decent experience.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.638 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: But it
was lovely for me,

00:12:16.638 --> 00:12:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and that's what got
we started, and then--

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.761 align:middle line:84%
so it was really a path of-- I
ended up following Thich Nhat

00:12:21.761 --> 00:12:22.260 align:middle line:90%
Hanh.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.810 align:middle line:90%
I just love his writings.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Chogyam Trungpa's
writings are so intense,

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.170 align:middle line:84%
and kind of confrontational,
and kind of anti-culture

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.140 align:middle line:90%
and I love that.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:29.960 align:middle line:90%
And then Amma.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.000 align:middle line:84%
I was traveling and
touring with Amma.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And then it just all kind
of just grew into this thing

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.260 align:middle line:84%
and I realized,
after a while, wow.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.574 align:middle line:84%
All these amazing teachers
just showed up in my life.

00:12:41.574 --> 00:12:42.990 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even have
to do anything.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.300 align:middle line:90%
They just showed up.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.346 align:middle line:90%
Very, very fortunate.

00:12:45.346 --> 00:12:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you stayed
in touch with your dreams,

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.710 align:middle line:84%
and this is really
critical to this, so.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:51.450 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: I did.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:51.950 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:55.470 align:middle line:84%
I kept going in the
performing realm,

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.760 align:middle line:84%
and more and more, I got
into educational stuff.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.510 align:middle line:84%
I started leading retreats
where I would do, basically,

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.090 align:middle line:84%
theatrical kind of
psychic drama where

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.926 align:middle line:84%
if I hold somebody's
hand, I can feel

00:13:05.926 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:90%
what they're going through.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.570 align:middle line:84%
I can play a character
in their life

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:11.230 align:middle line:84%
and then we work something
out, and I did those retreats

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.120 align:middle line:90%
for a while.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And then my corporate
stuff took off

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.360 align:middle line:84%
and my one man shows took
off around the world,

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and so I did all
that for a long time.

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, I started
inventing technologies

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and raising money
for technology,

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and I'm running a technology
startup now here in Boulder.

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.150 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, my
skills advanced

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.070 align:middle line:84%
and my understanding of how
to run workshops and retreats

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.100 align:middle line:90%
grew.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.635 align:middle line:84%
And three years ago, I
had this beautiful dream.

00:13:37.635 --> 00:13:38.880 align:middle line:90%
I had done my taxes.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.110 align:middle line:90%
It was April 15, did my taxes.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So your
mind was freed up?

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: It was.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.880 align:middle line:84%
That's a great way to--
I never thought of that.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:46.427 align:middle line:90%
It was.

00:13:46.427 --> 00:13:48.260 align:middle line:84%
I had literally just
gave birth to something

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.790 align:middle line:90%
that was terribly painful.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:50.456 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:50.456 --> 00:13:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: And you're right.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.230 align:middle line:90%
That's a great way to put it.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.087 align:middle line:90%
I was freed up.

00:13:53.087 --> 00:13:55.670 align:middle line:84%
That's great because, you know,
you gruel over this paperwork.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:56.461 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:57.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:58.385 align:middle line:90%
In the mail, OK.

00:13:58.385 --> 00:13:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:90%
Thank heavens, right?

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.470 align:middle line:84%
But I woke up about 3
o'clock in the morning

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:07.362 align:middle line:84%
to this beautiful dream of a
waterfall with these faces,

00:14:07.362 --> 00:14:09.570 align:middle line:84%
and it was very-- you know
those dreams that are just

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.472 align:middle line:84%
so palpable that you kind
of have to stop for a second

00:14:12.472 --> 00:14:13.430 align:middle line:90%
and say, wait a second.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:15.204 align:middle line:84%
This is a little more
than just a dream.

00:14:15.204 --> 00:14:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: So I
woke up and I just

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.580 align:middle line:84%
started writing down what I saw
and when I actually came out

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.270 align:middle line:84%
of the dream state and was
awake the next morning,

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.860 align:middle line:90%
they were personality names.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And I had written down
about 235 of them.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And so I just started
writing about them,

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.570 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
these books came from.

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:35.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's "The Field Guide
to Human Personalities,"

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.700 align:middle line:90%
but it's actually three volumes.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Each one has 78 personalities,
and it's a total of 234.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.490 align:middle line:84%
But I realized each
personality was very unique

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.770 align:middle line:84%
and had a very
specific name, and so I

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.460 align:middle line:84%
got into the behavioral, the
emotional, the spiritual,

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.987 align:middle line:90%
the psychological of each.

00:14:52.987 --> 00:14:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And then in each chapter,
I talk about that,

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:58.334 align:middle line:84%
and then I talk about some
remedies and modalities

00:14:58.334 --> 00:15:00.500 align:middle line:84%
like mudras and mantras
that can help you just shift

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:84%
a little bit to kind of
break that connection

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.520 align:middle line:84%
or that somewhat of
addiction sometimes

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.870 align:middle line:84%
to these personalities we
have, which are just temporary.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
wanted to explore.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.725 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So really
this was a download.

00:15:12.725 --> 00:15:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:14.250 align:middle line:90%
Total download.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you say
it also has embedded

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:19.720 align:middle line:90%
in it kind of union archetypes.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: It felt
that way after,

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:22.440 align:middle line:90%
because I was very into Jung.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.820 align:middle line:84%
I read a lot of Jung and
I loved the archetypes.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.350 align:middle line:84%
But what I was feeling--
two things were happening.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:30.340 align:middle line:84%
One is, I loved
the-- Jung really

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.340 align:middle line:84%
started spiritual psychology,
really examining yourself

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.850 align:middle line:90%
from a higher perspective.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Not just it's mother,
it's my father,

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:38.790 align:middle line:84%
but it's this broader,
beautiful picture.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.600 align:middle line:90%
And a fabric, if you will.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.950 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, I was a pretty
rambunctious, you know,

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:50.950 align:middle line:84%
tough, wild, on fire
comedian deeply entrenched

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.730 align:middle line:90%
in the New Age world.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Which is somewhat antithetical,
because the New Age scene was

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.570 align:middle line:84%
born out-- you know,
it's the Aquarian age,

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:00.569 align:middle line:84%
it's women are healing,
the feminine is healing,

00:16:00.569 --> 00:16:02.400 align:middle line:90%
and here I am, a wild man.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.890 align:middle line:84%
I didn't speak to anybody
in the Amma community

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:06.432 align:middle line:84%
and the Buddhist
community for years,

00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:08.431 align:middle line:84%
because anything that
would come out of my mouth

00:16:08.431 --> 00:16:10.250 align:middle line:84%
was-- it would have
felt too destructive.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.760 align:middle line:84%
People were healing
and I want to respect

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.840 align:middle line:84%
that the women have to
heal because they've

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.940 align:middle line:90%
been abused for so long.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:20.300 align:middle line:84%
So for me, how does a
robust, masculine man-- even

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.010 align:middle line:84%
how sensitive I am but
I'm still a guy's guy.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:25.740 align:middle line:84%
How do I heal if
I can't speak up?

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:29.630 align:middle line:84%
So this is really,
if I can say this,

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.680 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of-- it's New Age.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.500 align:middle line:90%
It's new thought.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.420 align:middle line:84%
It's somewhat out there,
but it's grounded.

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.660 align:middle line:90%
It's actionable.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.060 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like
New Age with a penis,

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:39.855 align:middle line:90%
if I can say that.

00:16:39.855 --> 00:16:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
you can see that.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.830 align:middle line:84%
You can see the masculine
influence in it,

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:47.840 align:middle line:84%
because the images are very--
it's almost like a comic book

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.060 align:middle line:90%
style in your face.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.260 align:middle line:90%
You know, ah!

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.690 align:middle line:90%
Flames, you know?

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, fire, burning
down, falling down.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.007 align:middle line:90%
It's like, whoa.

00:16:55.007 --> 00:16:57.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I first saw
it, I thought, oh my god.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really quite sure
what to make of all of this.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:04.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a very different--
appearingly irreverent-- look

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.810 align:middle line:90%
at archetypes.

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:10.119 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: I was trying for
a measure of irreverence

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and to kind of shake
somebody a little bit.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:14.849 align:middle line:84%
In all the modalities that I've
experience with the masters,

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:90%
it's not easy.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.236 align:middle line:90%
It's never easy.

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:19.235 align:middle line:84%
Like, Amma doesn't go
around like, oh everything

00:17:19.235 --> 00:17:20.020 align:middle line:90%
is wonderful.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.869 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it shakes you.

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Just being around
her shakes you.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to provide
something that wasn't all white

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.940 align:middle line:84%
light, airy fairy because you
know a lot of the New Age,

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.580 align:middle line:84%
as much as I love it because it
is bringing light to the planet

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:38.470 align:middle line:84%
and it's a movement, a lot of
it speaks of, if you're having

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:41.010 align:middle line:84%
a negative thought just,
like, whisk it away and I just

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:42.950 align:middle line:84%
don't-- it's not what
you should be doing.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:47.720 align:middle line:84%
If it shows up, look at it, find
compassion for it, embrace it.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.461 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: Feel that
emotion because--

00:17:50.461 --> 00:17:52.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Too much
brushing under the rug.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.570 align:middle line:90%
And then what happens?

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know,
we hit 55 or 60

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.470 align:middle line:84%
and we're just going
to explode and that's

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.760 align:middle line:84%
where disease comes
from, I think.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And I kept thinking about Jesus
in the desert for 40 days.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.270 align:middle line:84%
What was he-- he wasn't
making sand castles.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:08.970 align:middle line:84%
He was looking deeply at
every facet of humanity,

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.040 align:middle line:84%
every type of individual,
every image he could imagine,

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.700 align:middle line:84%
to fully process and find
the emotion, and therefore

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.010 align:middle line:90%
the wisdom, for all of humanity.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
wanted to provide.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.860 align:middle line:84%
An actionable tool
set that helps

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:26.050 align:middle line:84%
you actually intensify that
spiritual growth that you're

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:26.790 align:middle line:90%
seeking.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.955 align:middle line:84%
You know when I
first looked at it,

00:18:29.955 --> 00:18:32.580 align:middle line:84%
I was looking through the book,
and I was looking at the cards.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.780 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them were
like, well, here.

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's just take a few off
the front right there.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.160 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them were
really in your face.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.160 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh. you know.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.360 align:middle line:90%
Convoluted, grouchy.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.100 align:middle line:90%
It's like, whoa.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:49.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to-- I'm going to
hear all bad stuff about myself

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.000 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.720 align:middle line:90%
So talk about that.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Why did you choose to take
our, you know, grumpy, grouchy,

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.027 align:middle line:90%
and other such traits?

00:18:56.027 --> 00:18:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Oh, I love that.

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.330 align:middle line:84%
That's a great
question, and that

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.370 align:middle line:84%
is the most important
question about this work,

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:03.420 align:middle line:84%
so I appreciate you
asking it so directly.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.600 align:middle line:84%
20% of the cards, so
about 15 of the cards,

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.610 align:middle line:84%
are literally grabbing somebody
a little bit by the throat.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we did
that-- and I say we

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:15.404 align:middle line:84%
because my partner that drew
all these beautiful drawings,

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:17.320 align:middle line:84%
we came up with the
stories and the narratives

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.278 align:middle line:90%
over a number of years.

00:19:18.278 --> 00:19:20.695 align:middle line:84%
This woman, Loukia
Kyriakidou, was amazing.

00:19:20.695 --> 00:19:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.295 align:middle line:90%
It's fun artwork.

00:19:22.295 --> 00:19:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.790 align:middle line:90%
She's really talented.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's very lively.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.585 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:19:25.585 --> 00:19:26.380 align:middle line:90%
You can feel.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Like, you get a
sense of a scene.

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:33.570 align:middle line:84%
But the idea was, it's
really hard to admit things

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:34.900 align:middle line:90%
about ourselves.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.310 align:middle line:90%
I know how I am.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:37.940 align:middle line:84%
There are pieces
of me that I just

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.510 align:middle line:84%
have a hard time
admitting and looking at,

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:43.730 align:middle line:84%
and then my relationships
don't grow, I don't grow,

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:48.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm not expanding, and I realize
this is how I've always done it

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:51.340 align:middle line:84%
for myself is, I always end up
looking at the real hard stuff

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.424 align:middle line:90%
eventually.

00:19:52.424 --> 00:19:54.340 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to give
people the opportunity to,

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.710 align:middle line:84%
hey, here's what's happening
or here's something, maybe,

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:59.480 align:middle line:84%
you're scared of, but
why be scared of it?

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And the writing is a little
different than the image.

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:05.980 align:middle line:84%
So when you actually get
to the reading of it,

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:09.560 align:middle line:84%
it'll be a little bumpy at the
start, but then it'll say, hey.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.370 align:middle line:84%
There's some value
in The Grouch,

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.540 align:middle line:84%
because The Grouch
is about excellence.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.640 align:middle line:84%
That's why the grouch is
so grumpy and so critical.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.640 align:middle line:84%
They're just seeking for you or
whatever they're involved with

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.150 align:middle line:90%
to be really good.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.150 align:middle line:90%
So they get and go argh!

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:23.941 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Until it's
good, they're grouchy.

00:20:23.941 --> 00:20:24.600 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And they might be grouchy
even after it's good,

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.440 align:middle line:84%
but what I always like to
say about The Grouch is,

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.440 align:middle line:90%
there's gold in the grump.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.710 align:middle line:90%
There's gold in it.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And I had a partner
in Hollywood,

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:37.050 align:middle line:84%
a guy named Fred Silverman
who ran all the TV networks.

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:41.060 align:middle line:84%
He was my business
partner, and he's tough.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.580 align:middle line:90%
But he's brilliant.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:43.340 align:middle line:90%
He's brilliant.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.151 align:middle line:84%
And I realized from him
that, why should I ever

00:20:47.151 --> 00:20:49.400 align:middle line:84%
be scared or nervous around
that, because they're just

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.644 align:middle line:90%
bringing value to my life.

00:20:51.644 --> 00:20:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And I just noticed, like, even
a lot of my new age friends

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.560 align:middle line:84%
are like, oh, I don't talk
to that kind of person,

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:56.518 align:middle line:90%
or this kind of person.

00:20:56.518 --> 00:20:59.821 align:middle line:84%
They're so much in avoidance
mode, but that's not humanity.

00:20:59.821 --> 00:21:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Avoiding pain.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:01.445 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:21:01.445 --> 00:21:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you just take
a little bit of time,

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.340 align:middle line:90%
it's actually not that painful.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.340 align:middle line:84%
There might be a little
tear, or a little--

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.240 align:middle line:84%
but then it's like,
oh, The Grouch.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.090 align:middle line:84%
What a beautiful,
loving creature, and you

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:13.464 align:middle line:84%
can fall in love
with The Grouch.

00:21:13.464 --> 00:21:16.025 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK So how do we
fall in love with The Whiner?

00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: Well, you
know, any of these,

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:21.730 align:middle line:90%
like The Flake, The Failure.

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:23.010 align:middle line:90%
These are all parts of us.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:24.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've had
success, obviously.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I've whined plenty.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.026 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Right?

00:21:27.026 --> 00:21:28.120 align:middle line:90%
We whine.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.942 align:middle line:90%
I whine all the time.

00:21:29.942 --> 00:21:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Been a flake.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Right same here.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:33.890 align:middle line:90%
And what was that about?

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:35.450 align:middle line:90%
How can I not do that again?

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:38.110 align:middle line:84%
Or, if I do do that, how
can I, in that moment,

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:42.550 align:middle line:84%
recognize something quick--
how can I recognize it quicker?

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:45.536 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I brought
these to life in that way.

00:21:45.536 --> 00:21:47.410 align:middle line:84%
What I've been doing is
running these meet up

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:49.660 align:middle line:84%
groups in all these different
cities, because I really

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.630 align:middle line:84%
wanted to find out,
what is this thing.

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:53.190 align:middle line:90%
Because it's very different.

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And what people are
saying is, because we

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.740 align:middle line:84%
go through these
things together,

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:00.880 align:middle line:84%
is that they're
finding that they're

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.780 align:middle line:84%
getting to know themselves much
quicker than they were before

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.000 align:middle line:84%
in the other modalities
that they were using.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.472 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, they're
still a little concerned

00:22:08.472 --> 00:22:09.930 align:middle line:84%
about some of the
images, so that's

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.010 align:middle line:90%
the feedback I'm getting.

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:12.680 align:middle line:90%
No, I can understand that.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.865 align:middle line:90%
I think that's fair.

00:22:13.865 --> 00:22:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: It is fair.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.281 align:middle line:84%
So I'm actually
considering-- there's

00:22:16.281 --> 00:22:18.860 align:middle line:84%
nine images that
I might actually

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:19.990 align:middle line:90%
lighten up a little bit.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:21.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's, I mean,
I want to learn too.

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you still have
that in your face part of you.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.530 align:middle line:90%
You know, like you said.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a masculine
version of this.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:28.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not Doreen
Virtue's Angel Cards.

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: It's a little
different than the Angel

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:30.955 align:middle line:90%
cards, yeah.

00:22:30.955 --> 00:22:32.085 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You think?

00:22:32.085 --> 00:22:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.490 align:middle line:90%
Just a little bit.

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:37.340 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:38.400 align:middle line:90%
The healing modalities.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:38.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Because in the book,
you incorporate things

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.930 align:middle line:84%
like gemstones, flower
essences, essential oils.

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
that a little bit.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.390 align:middle line:84%
The healing properties
of the book.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.350 align:middle line:84%
Because that's really
counter to those images.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:51.415 align:middle line:84%
In a lot of ways,
you'd say, really.

00:22:51.415 --> 00:22:53.330 align:middle line:84%
He talks about
essential oils in there?

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:54.264 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding me?

00:22:54.264 --> 00:22:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: Well, you know,
I'll even take an example.

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Like there's a character in
here called the righteous beast.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.660 align:middle line:90%
And I can get that way.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.600 align:middle line:84%
I can get harshly judgmental
about society, or government.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.632 align:middle line:84%
You know, I can get negative
and find myself just pointing

00:23:06.632 --> 00:23:08.590 align:middle line:84%
the finger rather than
coming up with solutions

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:10.090 align:middle line:84%
or bringing light
into something.

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm in that
mode, sometimes,

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:16.530 align:middle line:84%
if I just take a little
star of Bethlehem,

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:21.880 align:middle line:84%
you know, Bach flower remedy,
I'm a new person in 25 minutes.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm a new person.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm literally the light
of God in 25 minutes.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.690 align:middle line:84%
So what I've learned--
I mean, I've just--

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:30.086 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The vision of
compassion and acceptance.

00:23:30.086 --> 00:23:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So OK.

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, how did you start
pairing these gemstones,

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.657 align:middle line:84%
essences, and all of this
with these archetypes?

00:23:38.657 --> 00:23:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: These are
awesome questions.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.060 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is great.

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:44.880 align:middle line:84%
So what a friend
of mine said, OK.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm these-- so what I say is
like six or seven personalities

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.096 align:middle line:84%
we kind of juggle just
throughout our life,

00:23:50.096 --> 00:23:52.470 align:middle line:84%
depending on what we want from
a lover, or from a friend,

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:54.740 align:middle line:84%
from a job, and so they
kind of continually

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:55.590 align:middle line:90%
show up for a while.

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And some you drop off
and pick up a new one.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:59.320 align:middle line:90%
So the question was, OK.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm these personalities.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.880 align:middle line:90%
Now what, smart guy?

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:02.782 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, uh.

00:24:02.782 --> 00:24:03.282 align:middle line:90%
Eh.

00:24:03.282 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:90%
Uh.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.959 align:middle line:84%
So then I had to look deeper
into what I'd been doing,

00:24:05.959 --> 00:24:08.307 align:middle line:84%
and that's-- so I had
to bring my process,

00:24:08.307 --> 00:24:09.890 align:middle line:84%
which was looking
at all these things.

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:15.600 align:middle line:84%
So I broke down each personality
into emotions and phrases,

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.360 align:middle line:84%
and those emotions
and phrases are pieces

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.220 align:middle line:90%
of what that individual is.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And so then I
looked at gemstones,

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:24.807 align:middle line:90%
and all the different colors.

00:24:24.807 --> 00:24:26.140 align:middle line:90%
So I looked at all those things.

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Mudras, mantras, and
I wanted to find out

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:30.490 align:middle line:90%
what those were vibrationally.

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:33.585 align:middle line:84%
So I looked at original
Sanskrit, at original Hebrew,

00:24:33.585 --> 00:24:34.960 align:middle line:84%
you know, the
different languages

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.730 align:middle line:84%
that these things come in,
and I made these flow charts

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:42.085 align:middle line:84%
tying them to those emotions
related to that personality.

00:24:42.085 --> 00:24:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
came up with it.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.880 align:middle line:84%
But the way I speak about
them, in each chapter,

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.475 align:middle line:84%
I have that
personality empowerment

00:24:47.475 --> 00:24:49.350 align:middle line:90%
section that talks about it.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:52.380 align:middle line:84%
What I do is, I say, this
is just a suggestion.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, here's a
broad scope of things

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.730 align:middle line:90%
that you might want to explore.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's because I
think, when you're actually

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.760 align:middle line:84%
trying to make
major shifts, it's

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.880 align:middle line:84%
really helpful to talk
to a professional that's

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:08.150 align:middle line:84%
really a professional
Bach flower or homeopath.

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.640 align:middle line:84%
It's incredible when you
spend time with those people,

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.330 align:middle line:90%
because they're seeing--

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you
really-- I mean,

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.620 align:middle line:84%
do you really-- you respond,
I take it, very well

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.627 align:middle line:90%
to Bach flower remedies.

00:25:15.627 --> 00:25:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Oh my god.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm crazy about them.

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.154 align:middle line:84%
I don't find anything
else as incredibly.

00:25:20.154 --> 00:25:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: See, I haven't
explored them enough.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Just a little here
and there, and I'm

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:26.340 align:middle line:84%
asking because I'm
wondering about that myself.

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:27.600 align:middle line:90%
It might be fun.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.576 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: I love them.

00:25:28.576 --> 00:25:29.700 align:middle line:90%
I had a different approach.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.158 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the way
they describe them,

00:25:31.158 --> 00:25:32.930 align:middle line:84%
it's like, give me
three drops in a glass,

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:34.070 align:middle line:90%
and put, like, a sip.

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't do that.

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just.

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.125 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: I do.

00:25:36.125 --> 00:25:37.450 align:middle line:90%
I'll do-- if I'm in the mode--

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:37.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right on the tongue.

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: Like, if I'm
that righteous beast.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sting me.

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:40.810 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just put that
stuff on your tongue.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Exactly.

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:43.530 align:middle line:90%
Just tap it in.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:44.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm in.

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:49.660 align:middle line:84%
So I'll do eight drops under
the tongue every half hour

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:51.480 align:middle line:90%
for like two or three hours.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.480 align:middle line:90%
But boom.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.720 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.824 align:middle line:84%
Some of the ones
that I was taking,

00:25:56.824 --> 00:25:59.240 align:middle line:84%
you know, they can send you
way up into your crown Chakra,

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.010 align:middle line:84%
and literally, you're
just channeling.

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:02.450 align:middle line:90%
So I want to be careful of that.

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are
a couple of those?

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: I do really
well with beech, pine.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.490 align:middle line:84%
They do really well cleaning
some of the ego stuff

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:11.971 align:middle line:90%
out for me.

00:26:11.971 --> 00:26:13.220 align:middle line:90%
There's a whole bunch of them.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, here.

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:15.110 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to get
side tracked too much.

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.410 align:middle line:90%
I was just intrigued with that.

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:16.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah, me too.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.620 align:middle line:84%
That's one of my
favorite things.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
the book has-- here

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.950 align:middle line:84%
you have-- I'm going
to have to explain

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:23.360 align:middle line:90%
how the cards work before.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.037 align:middle line:84%
In a little bit, we're
going to have Mark come out,

00:26:26.037 --> 00:26:27.370 align:middle line:90%
and you're going to do readings.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:27.800 align:middle line:90%
He's nervous.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.710 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh my god.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:30.310 align:middle line:90%
Everybody can see all my traits.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.810 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: It doesn't matter
if he's a sweetheart.

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He is a
total sweetheart.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:34.000 align:middle line:90%
We love Mark.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.550 align:middle line:84%
So you have morsels,
message, caution, extreme,

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:38.990 align:middle line:90%
and empowerment.

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:40.650 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what these are.

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:41.275 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Cool.

00:26:41.275 --> 00:26:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: People are set up.

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:43.405 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:26:43.405 --> 00:26:44.880 align:middle line:90%
So morsel.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.180 align:middle line:84%
So the personality starts
with a first person monologue,

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.587 align:middle line:84%
so you can hear
that person talk.

00:26:50.587 --> 00:26:51.920 align:middle line:90%
So that kind of gets you set up.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
use The Grouch,

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:53.680 align:middle line:84%
because we've already
talked about it.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.221 align:middle line:84%
What would a morsel
in The Grouch be?

00:26:55.221 --> 00:26:57.446 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: So a morsel
in the-- I don't

00:26:57.446 --> 00:27:00.634 align:middle line:84%
know what it says, because
I forget what I wrote,

00:27:00.634 --> 00:27:02.800 align:middle line:84%
but that morsel, as soon
as you-- so the first thing

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.300 align:middle line:90%
is a morsel.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.370 align:middle line:90%
It's just one line.

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:06.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a quick, little one off.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Like if you're running out
the door, you draw a card,

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and you just go flip
the page, morsel.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:12.210 align:middle line:90%
Ah, that's kind of cool.

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:14.626 align:middle line:84%
And it's something you can
think about throughout the day.

00:27:14.626 --> 00:27:15.460 align:middle line:90%
So you grab that.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Message is just a very down
to earth description of,

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.667 align:middle line:84%
there's sometimes a
little story mixed in.

00:27:21.667 --> 00:27:24.000 align:middle line:84%
It talks about what are the
basic traits, the attributes

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.070 align:middle line:90%
of this creature.

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:27.760 align:middle line:84%
What are some of just the
basic, chill tendencies?

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.290 align:middle line:90%
Nothing out there.

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.099 align:middle line:84%
And then in traditional
Tarot, I kept

00:27:32.099 --> 00:27:33.640 align:middle line:84%
looking at-- and
medicine cards, too,

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:37.000 align:middle line:84%
which I think the medicine
cards are so lovely.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.255 align:middle line:84%
I kept looking at
this idea of reversed.

00:27:39.255 --> 00:27:41.380 align:middle line:84%
You know when you draw a
card and it's upside down?

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:41.646 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:41.646 --> 00:27:41.780 align:middle line:90%
Mhmm.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: That would
always bum me out,

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.200 align:middle line:84%
because as soon as you
draw that reverse card--

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You say, hey.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:46.070 align:middle line:90%
That's not fair.

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Someone just shipped the
deck up wrong last time.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah, exactly.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:49.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Or you're like, this is
going to be terrible.

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:55.617 align:middle line:84%
And I look at the
moment of intention

00:27:55.617 --> 00:27:56.950 align:middle line:90%
when you're drawing those cards.

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:59.580 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you
intend to seek help,

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.850 align:middle line:90%
the whole thing changes anyway.

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:04.136 align:middle line:90%
So why call it a reversed?

00:28:04.136 --> 00:28:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And leave it up
to the individual

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.510 align:middle line:84%
to intuit the message
for themselves.

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:08.865 align:middle line:90%
So I go from message, which is--

00:28:08.865 --> 00:28:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it
doesn't matter if these

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:11.910 align:middle line:90%
are upside down or not.

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:12.475 align:middle line:90%
No reversals.

00:28:12.475 --> 00:28:14.766 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: Doesn't matter,
didn't want to get into that.

00:28:14.766 --> 00:28:15.581 align:middle line:90%
But I do get into--

00:28:15.581 --> 00:28:16.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Caution.

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.371 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: Caution, which
is more like a reversed.

00:28:18.371 --> 00:28:20.490 align:middle line:84%
It's when things are
kind of messed up.

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:23.560 align:middle line:84%
But then I take it to a whole
other level, because most of us

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.260 align:middle line:84%
have major traumatic
events in our lives,

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:29.560 align:middle line:84%
which, in these
reversed card systems,

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.445 align:middle line:84%
they're just not
strong enough for me.

00:28:32.445 --> 00:28:34.070 align:middle line:84%
So I want to give
people three options.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:35.730 align:middle line:90%
So message, down to earth.

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Caution, hey, things are
really kind of messed up.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.720 align:middle line:90%
They're getting messed up.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.200 align:middle line:84%
But you can make a
couple of changes,

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.170 align:middle line:90%
and here's what you do.

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:42.960 align:middle line:90%
And then extreme is, OK.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.350 align:middle line:90%
The house is on fire.

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:46.060 align:middle line:90%
You're hanging from a rope.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.544 align:middle line:84%
This is the last thing you
can do to save yourself.

00:28:48.544 --> 00:28:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
take it out there,

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.600 align:middle line:84%
because we all get in
that position of being

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.550 align:middle line:84%
in a major, major
difficult situation that

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:57.939 align:middle line:90%
looks completely unchangeable.

00:28:57.939 --> 00:28:59.230 align:middle line:90%
So that's how I deal with that.

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And then personality
empowerment is--

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:01.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Empowerment, yeah.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: So in the midst
of this personality.

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:04.740 align:middle line:84%
It's showing up
all over the place.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm not enjoying it very much.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.234 align:middle line:90%
How do I get to joy?

00:29:08.234 --> 00:29:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And just trying a
couple of those things

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.459 align:middle line:90%
ends up working pretty well.

00:29:11.459 --> 00:29:12.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I love that part.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:13.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:14.360 align:middle line:90%
So let me ask you this.

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:17.780 align:middle line:84%
If we're-- well,
there are two things.

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:21.672 align:middle line:84%
One, for your own life, having
developed this, do you use it?

00:29:21.672 --> 00:29:22.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: I use it every day.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:23.421 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:23.421 --> 00:29:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And how have you found
it to affect your life?

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:28.375 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you're in
resonance with it,

00:29:28.375 --> 00:29:30.180 align:middle line:84%
because you came
up with this stuff.

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:32.320 align:middle line:10%
>>WAGNER: Well, yeah.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.110 align:middle line:10%
Well, first of all, it
feels like a gift to me.

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:37.640 align:middle line:84%
So as I was writing
it over three years,

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.120 align:middle line:90%
there was just a lot of crying.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.020 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I first
started writing it,

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.910 align:middle line:84%
there was just sobbing
in each personality.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So what happens for me, when I
do readings for myself, which

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.950 align:middle line:84%
are very simple--
I mean, I don't

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:52.069 align:middle line:84%
go-- they're not 12-card
spreads and you're

00:29:52.069 --> 00:29:53.360 align:middle line:90%
channeling the Akashic records.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're out the
door, you grab a card.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.799 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: Yeah, it's
quick, or just three cards.

00:29:56.799 --> 00:30:00.071 align:middle line:84%
And I made up some Jungian mixed
with tarot card spreads that

00:30:00.071 --> 00:30:02.070 align:middle line:84%
are in the books, so you
can actually, you know,

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:04.150 align:middle line:90%
do some structured one.

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:07.380 align:middle line:84%
But what I like to do is,
when I'm doing a reading,

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:11.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at, whatever
the question is,

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:13.150 align:middle line:84%
these are the personalities
that are showing up,

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:15.024 align:middle line:84%
but more importantly,
what are the attributes

00:30:15.024 --> 00:30:16.030 align:middle line:90%
of those personalities?

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:17.100 align:middle line:90%
What are the behaviors?

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:18.740 align:middle line:90%
What are the energetic trends?

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:23.080 align:middle line:84%
What are the situational trends
that are being shown to me?

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:26.259 align:middle line:84%
And what's within me
and what's within other.

00:30:26.259 --> 00:30:27.800 align:middle line:84%
What's happening in
the other people?

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.883 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the same as
what's happening with me,

00:30:29.883 --> 00:30:31.650 align:middle line:90%
because there is no other.

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:33.340 align:middle line:84%
So as much as
we're asking about,

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.500 align:middle line:84%
like, an intimate relationship
or am I going to find a lover,

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.890 align:middle line:84%
or is this thing
going to happen?

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It all
comes back to you.

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.460 align:middle line:90%
And

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:39.585 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Everything is us.

00:30:39.585 --> 00:30:42.010 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing is just a dream.

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:44.885 align:middle line:84%
So if we can fall in love with
it all- so that's my journey

00:30:44.885 --> 00:30:46.930 align:middle line:84%
is to fall in love
with my readings.

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:48.970 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what tough
of a card, whether it's

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:51.850 align:middle line:84%
The Toxic, The Hedonist,
The Grouch-- those are

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:53.960 align:middle line:84%
the tough ones-- or The
Healer, The Fearless,

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.570 align:middle line:84%
some of the beautiful
ones, no matter

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:59.690 align:middle line:84%
what it is, I want to love the
parts that I'm feeling reactive

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:02.230 align:middle line:84%
or like I'm scared
of, and I want

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:05.470 align:middle line:84%
to reduce the ego in the
ones that I've got up

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:08.460 align:middle line:84%
on a spiritual pedestal,
so that I end up

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:12.220 align:middle line:84%
without in the space
of without ego,

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.870 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not in a place of
kind of parasympathetic kind

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:18.310 align:middle line:84%
of addiction that the new
age thing kind of creates,

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:20.260 align:middle line:90%
that it's, I'm here.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm working through it.

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.784 align:middle line:90%
I've forgiven that person.

00:31:22.784 --> 00:31:24.200 align:middle line:84%
I've forgiven that
part of myself.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.790 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I
try to do every day.

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And I ask very specific
questions sometimes.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.976 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and you're clearly

00:31:28.976 --> 00:31:30.570 align:middle line:90%
very emotionally available.

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Very helpful in general,
I think, because emotions,

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.237 align:middle line:90%
there's no wisdom.

00:31:36.237 --> 00:31:37.070 align:middle line:90%
It's just impossible

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:38.779 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's giving
us our information.

00:31:38.779 --> 00:31:39.403 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:31:39.403 --> 00:31:40.650 align:middle line:90%
That's a nice way to put it.

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:41.860 align:middle line:90%
It's all the information.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:43.510 align:middle line:90%
I cry all the time.

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:46.265 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'll see
wind blowing a branch

00:31:46.265 --> 00:31:49.182 align:middle line:84%
and I'll be like,
that is so beautiful.

00:31:49.182 --> 00:31:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you're
worse than me.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: I know.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:51.541 align:middle line:90%
I'm terrible.

00:31:51.541 --> 00:31:55.132 align:middle line:84%
But also, you know, I'm kind
of a crass, wild cretin.

00:31:55.132 --> 00:31:56.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm a very unusual
combination of things.

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:57.381 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:31:57.381 --> 00:31:59.640 align:middle line:84%
That's good to be that
open across the board.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.780 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going
to see-- don't make

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.425 align:middle line:90%
Mark cry in front of everybody.

00:32:03.425 --> 00:32:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: No, no, no.

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:04.170 align:middle line:90%
I only do that to myself.

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:04.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:06.640 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
rearrange the chairs.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.210 align:middle line:84%
We'll be back in just a moment,
and we'll have Mark with us,

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:13.091 align:middle line:84%
and we will see how
a reading happens.

00:32:13.091 --> 00:32:13.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:16.210 align:middle line:84%
We're back, and now we're
going to begin the reading.

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:18.100 align:middle line:90%
And we're starting fresh.

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.910 align:middle line:84%
You've handled the
cards, and you're

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:22.560 align:middle line:84%
going to infuse them with
your own energy in a moment,

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.070 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
butt out and you

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:26.970 align:middle line:84%
guys-- I hope you have
a profound reading.

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:28.405 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: We're excited.

00:32:28.405 --> 00:32:29.946 align:middle line:84%
So I just took these
out of the pouch

00:32:29.946 --> 00:32:31.320 align:middle line:90%
and I'm handing them to you.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:35.270 align:middle line:84%
So a good thing to do with
any divination practice,

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:37.120 align:middle line:84%
using any tool or
anything in life,

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.860 align:middle line:84%
really, is to take
a deep breath,

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:44.295 align:middle line:84%
and to just clear your mind and
heart of the negative debris,

00:32:44.295 --> 00:32:47.990 align:middle line:84%
the judgment, all the icky
stuff that doesn't really

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:50.090 align:middle line:84%
help us progress,
and when you're

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:53.490 align:middle line:84%
feeling kind of clear and ready,
maybe think of a question.

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:55.900 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be super
specific, but as specific

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.810 align:middle line:84%
as you'd like, and
then shuffle the cards,

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:01.360 align:middle line:84%
pick three, and put them
on top of each other.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.700 align:middle line:90%
Take your time.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Good thing
you have big hands.

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:04.344 align:middle line:90%
Those are big cards.

00:33:04.344 --> 00:33:05.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: These are big cards.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:06.847 align:middle line:90%
They're very nice.

00:33:06.847 --> 00:33:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: They're durable.

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: Durable, OK.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.732 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: Just stay with the
questions and the feelings.

00:33:13.732 --> 00:33:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK: The questions
and the feelings.

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:18.360 align:middle line:84%
So I can ask more
than one question.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: You can.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:20.990 align:middle line:84%
You can ask a number of
things, and you never

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:22.605 align:middle line:84%
know what comes up
in these things.

00:33:22.605 --> 00:33:23.105 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: OK.

00:33:23.105 --> 00:33:27.338 align:middle line:90%


00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:28.700 align:middle line:90%
And pick three?

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: Pick three and
place them right there.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: OK.

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:33.295 align:middle line:90%
Face down?

00:33:33.295 --> 00:33:33.920 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Sure.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:38.540 align:middle line:90%


00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:39.460 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.753 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: Set these down.

00:33:40.753 --> 00:33:44.260 align:middle line:90%


00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:45.190 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: All right.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:47.340 align:middle line:90%
So you have picked three cards.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.200 align:middle line:90%
Oh, look at the tough ones.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:49.826 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:33:49.826 --> 00:33:50.784 align:middle line:90%
This is nice, actually.

00:33:50.784 --> 00:33:51.728 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh no.

00:33:51.728 --> 00:33:52.700 align:middle line:90%
Not a bad one.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: The Toxic.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: So this is what
happens is, some of these cards

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:57.700 align:middle line:90%
are a little intense.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And what they're trying
to share with you, I mean,

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.840 align:middle line:84%
your guides are
really speaking here.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.240 align:middle line:90%
It's your intuition.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.840 align:middle line:84%
It's what's
magnetizing within you,

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:11.860 align:middle line:84%
is a demonstration
of your wisdom

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:16.360 align:middle line:84%
and a demonstration of where
you want to take your life.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.896 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you
say them out loud

00:34:17.896 --> 00:34:19.270 align:middle line:84%
and we'll show
them on the screen

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:23.020 align:middle line:84%
so everybody knows what
we're looking at here?

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: So Mark
drew The Observer.

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:28.010 align:middle line:90%
That's one card.

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:30.920 align:middle line:90%
And then The Indifferent.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.639 align:middle line:90%
That's the second card.

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:35.211 align:middle line:90%
And then the third is The Toxic.

00:34:35.211 --> 00:34:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That one,
we talked about.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: Very
intense little card.

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.199 align:middle line:90%
Very intense little card.

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:41.960 align:middle line:90%
But let's talk about these.

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:42.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: Absolutely.

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:44.960 align:middle line:84%
WAGNER: And if you would,
actually pick one more card.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.459 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: OK.

00:34:45.459 --> 00:34:46.639 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Pretty please.

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK: From
anywhere in the deck?

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.731 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Anywhere in the deck.

00:34:48.731 --> 00:34:51.973 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK: I'm gonna
pick this card.

00:34:51.973 --> 00:34:52.639 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Great.

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:53.139 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:54.739 align:middle line:90%
So we'll leave that right here.

00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:56.320 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:56.820 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.440 align:middle line:84%
So right off the
bat, what you've

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.440 align:middle line:84%
learned through a large
part of your early life

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.940 align:middle line:90%
is to kind of be an observer.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.007 align:middle line:90%
There's always been--

00:35:06.007 --> 00:35:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: That's true.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: Is that
a big part of you?

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:08.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: Yes.

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.670 align:middle line:90%
Very much.

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:10.211 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: And as
The Observer, you've

00:35:10.211 --> 00:35:13.930 align:middle line:84%
picked up a couple things, some
positive, and some negative

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:14.610 align:middle line:90%
as The Observer.

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:15.984 align:middle line:84%
Because what
happens to observers

00:35:15.984 --> 00:35:19.120 align:middle line:84%
is, sometimes they can end up
observing so much, that when

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:23.420 align:middle line:84%
they finally decide that they
might want to do something

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.700 align:middle line:84%
that's kind of bold, and
different, and unique,

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.820 align:middle line:84%
they stop themselves,
because they've observed

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.362 align:middle line:84%
so much that they're like, oh,
that person did that, and then

00:35:30.362 --> 00:35:32.028 align:middle line:84%
well, that brought
them-- you know what?

00:35:32.028 --> 00:35:32.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.130 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason
to make a change.

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:38.950 align:middle line:84%
So that can be a challenging
piece to the observer.

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: Completely valid.

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Is it?

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:41.605 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: Yes.

00:35:41.605 --> 00:35:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: And what happens.

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:45.130 align:middle line:84%
When the observer
is just starting

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:47.240 align:middle line:84%
to understand the stuff
they're coming in,

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:51.112 align:middle line:84%
there's that moment where they
start to piece things together

00:35:51.112 --> 00:35:52.570 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, that
person, this person.

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And you start to
get a lot of wisdom.

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:57.930 align:middle line:90%
You grow a lot as an observer.

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:01.430 align:middle line:84%
What this can also do, it can
also make it a little bit lazy.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And lazy not in a really
bad sense, but a lazy

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:05.640 align:middle line:84%
in like, oh, well,
since that's already

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.670 align:middle line:84%
being manifested in
some way in the world,

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:09.510 align:middle line:90%
maybe I don't need to do it.

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:10.617 align:middle line:90%
And that has validity.

00:36:10.617 --> 00:36:12.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we all think of
that in creative projects.

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:13.460 align:middle line:90%
Well, is that out there?

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Somebody's doing
that really well.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:15.433 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:36:15.433 --> 00:36:17.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to do that.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:19.600 align:middle line:84%
But for you, in your
observing, you've

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.290 align:middle line:84%
actually amassed a great
deal of understanding.

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:26.430 align:middle line:84%
We're gonna get to what that
understanding is in a second.

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.680 align:middle line:84%
A big part of, possibly,
where you're at right now--

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.280 align:middle line:84%
this is kind of possibly
what I'm picking up here--

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.870 align:middle line:90%
is you've got a really huge.

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:39.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, your heart is just-- you
have a sweet, sweet, sensitive

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:39.860 align:middle line:90%
heart.

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:41.480 align:middle line:84%
I could just feel it
as soon as I met you.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.730 align:middle line:90%
I was like, what a sweetheart.

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:45.640 align:middle line:90%


00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And when somebody has
such a sweet heart,

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:54.800 align:middle line:84%
they can be jolted very easily
by even simple, basic harshness

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.099 align:middle line:90%
from people.

00:36:56.099 --> 00:36:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy to take some
of that a little personally,

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:00.340 align:middle line:90%
or have it kind of stop us.

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:01.610 align:middle line:90%
And I'm that way.

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I'll be so sweet,
I'll be talking to butterflies

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:05.686 align:middle line:84%
and, you know,
somebody will show up

00:37:05.686 --> 00:37:07.310 align:middle line:84%
and say or do something,
and I'm like--

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:08.492 align:middle line:90%
[CROAKING]

00:37:08.492 --> 00:37:09.075 align:middle line:90%
I can't speak.

00:37:09.075 --> 00:37:09.330 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:11.130 align:middle line:84%
It takes me, like,
months to find that one

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:13.179 align:middle line:90%
tier that I can speak again.

00:37:13.179 --> 00:37:14.720 align:middle line:84%
But there's a little
of that in here.

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is this
one you're pointing to?

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: This The Indifferent.

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: And what happens
with The Indifferent,

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:24.490 align:middle line:84%
after they understand all
these things they've seen,

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:27.910 align:middle line:84%
they've made some choices in
their lives, they've grown,

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:31.740 align:middle line:84%
they've gotten to a position
of mastering some things,

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:35.650 align:middle line:84%
really understanding pieces
of life, but for some reason,

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:38.300 align:middle line:84%
because they might not
have taken advantage

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.220 align:middle line:84%
of some of the early
passions-- they

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:44.060 align:middle line:84%
didn't grab it-- that
there's this period-- it's

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:45.680 align:middle line:84%
a very short period
of time, usually--

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:50.066 align:middle line:84%
where they're just a
little indifferent about,

00:37:50.066 --> 00:37:51.940 align:middle line:84%
well, I guess I don't
really need to do that.

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Or I don't really feel
very connected to that.

00:37:55.590 --> 00:38:00.150 align:middle line:84%
It's feeling a little separate
from reality, in a way.

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:01.610 align:middle line:90%
Not totally disconnected.

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:05.090 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say it's
The Indifferent, where

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:08.190 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to find
what that thing is

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:10.120 align:middle line:90%
that you want to do next.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's the predominant
feeling I have here is,

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.690 align:middle line:84%
what is that that
you want to do next?

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:17.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the question that I
felt was kind of coming in

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:19.440 align:middle line:90%
as we were sitting down.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.850 align:middle line:84%
That there's something you
actually have a passion for,

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:25.320 align:middle line:84%
there's something that you may
not have put into words yet.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.420 align:middle line:84%
But is there something
specific that you've

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:30.499 align:middle line:84%
started to piece together that
you want to try, or do, or?

00:38:30.499 --> 00:38:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: Yeah.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm a
visual artist, so I

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.690 align:middle line:84%
work with that material
a lot, and I've

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:40.330 align:middle line:90%
taken a break from that.

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm kind of just
coming out of a period

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:44.480 align:middle line:84%
where-- you know, I
have a small child,

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.200 align:middle line:84%
so I'm coming out of the period
of just kind of wondering

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.300 align:middle line:90%
exactly what you said.

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.450 align:middle line:90%
Just where am I going?

00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:53.000 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing?

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And not feeling-- feeling a
little dispassionate about it,

00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:01.170 align:middle line:90%
I guess, but not like bad.

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:02.030 align:middle line:90%
Like hopeful.

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:03.780 align:middle line:90%
Very hopeful.

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:06.600 align:middle line:84%
So just trying to
find that direction

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:10.015 align:middle line:84%
and just kind of get that
little nugget and go for it.

00:39:10.015 --> 00:39:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Cool.

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.990 align:middle line:84%
See, you're in
that pause before.

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:17.750 align:middle line:84%
You're in the pause between
two symphony movements.

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: I think I am.

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:19.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:23.407 align:middle line:84%
I could be post pause, but
clinging onto the pause.

00:39:23.407 --> 00:39:25.680 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that might be valid.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: But that's
what observers do.

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:29.370 align:middle line:84%
They love to watch
things unfold.

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:30.702 align:middle line:90%
And you're-- what are you?

00:39:30.702 --> 00:39:31.410 align:middle line:90%
You're an editor.

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:32.280 align:middle line:90%
You're a video editor.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: Yes, I am.

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: So you're in
the film business of you

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.670 align:middle line:90%
watch things on a screen.

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:37.980 align:middle line:90%
You're a great observer.

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.104 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's really
interesting that you drew this,

00:39:40.104 --> 00:39:40.790 align:middle line:90%
in so many ways.

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: Exactly.

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:43.170 align:middle line:84%
But I've always
been that person.

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:45.170 align:middle line:84%
I was fascinated
with subcultures

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:49.620 align:middle line:84%
when I was much younger, and,
you know, I saw too much.

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:50.440 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: Well, but you're
also super young enough to be

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:56.340 align:middle line:84%
able to do anything you
want, and you've accumulated

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:59.760 align:middle line:84%
a great deal of wisdom,
understanding, ability,

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.680 align:middle line:84%
and you're a strong man,
and you've got this ability

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.420 align:middle line:90%
to tap into your heart.

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:08.292 align:middle line:84%
You live through your
heart, and that's

00:40:08.292 --> 00:40:09.500 align:middle line:90%
a hard thing to do, actually.

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:10.083 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: It is.

00:40:10.083 --> 00:40:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: A lot of
people stop doing that.

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:15.770 align:middle line:84%
So I hope you keep that
alive, because it's beautiful.

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:17.920 align:middle line:84%
So then why do we-- so
then the question becomes,

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.970 align:middle line:84%
how do we end up here
at The Toxic card

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:23.650 align:middle line:84%
after this kind of sweet, little
story as you're in this pause?

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: Hmm.

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: And here's
what I want to say,

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.286 align:middle line:84%
and I'm gonna be a little
direct about it, if I can.

00:40:27.286 --> 00:40:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: Please do.

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:30.543 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: There are just a
couple of people in your life

00:40:30.543 --> 00:40:32.280 align:middle line:84%
that I'm just not sure
they belong there.

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And I just don't
feel like they're

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:38.540 align:middle line:84%
valuing you to the degree that
you really should be valued.

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And what I would say is, as you
look at some of the people--

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.050 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know
how many there are,

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:43.966 align:middle line:84%
but it feels like there's
a couple people that

00:40:43.966 --> 00:40:46.270 align:middle line:84%
use some language with you
that isn't very empowering,

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:48.430 align:middle line:84%
and you have an intimate
relationship with them.

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And I would start to
learn how to place

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.030 align:middle line:90%
a boundary on that language.

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:53.130 align:middle line:90%
Don't let it into your heart.

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Because you'll let
anything in because

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:56.093 align:middle line:90%
you want to be there for people.

00:40:56.093 --> 00:40:57.590 align:middle line:90%
You're really good at people.

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, what I feel
this card is also saying

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:03.300 align:middle line:84%
is that you've mastered
toxins in a way.

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:06.670 align:middle line:84%
You've kind of, maybe,
had some bad patterns.

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some things you did for
awhile and you're finally like,

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.260 align:middle line:84%
you know what, I'll
never do that again.

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And out of the
exploration, no matter

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:17.210 align:middle line:84%
whether it was an addiction or
just a bad behavioral pattern,

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:18.435 align:middle line:90%
or just a bad trajectory.

00:41:18.435 --> 00:41:20.549 align:middle line:84%
Because you met this
person, you did this thing,

00:41:20.549 --> 00:41:22.090 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
you're like, wow.

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:22.930 align:middle line:90%
That was stupid.

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:24.470 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is.

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:25.420 align:middle line:90%
And we've all done it.

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:26.878 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK: What color
was that liquid?

00:41:26.878 --> 00:41:28.324 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:41:28.324 --> 00:41:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: Should I have
drank the whole thing?

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.940 align:middle line:90%


00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Regardless, you've mastered
this, the notion of toxins.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:40.244 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like you know, if
you're ever bitten by a snake.

00:41:40.244 --> 00:41:42.910 align:middle line:84%
I was bit by a snake once, and I
was able to suck something out,

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:45.390 align:middle line:84%
but there's something
about toxins.

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:47.140 align:middle line:84%
You've kind of done
something for yourself

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:50.640 align:middle line:84%
where toxins don't really
affect you the way they used to.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.320 align:middle line:90%
And there's a mastering of that.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And as you were sitting down,
just what came to me about you,

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:58.110 align:middle line:84%
separate from the cards you've
drawn, I just wanted share it,

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll get to this,
because this is your influence,

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:02.170 align:middle line:90%
is The Healer.

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:06.322 align:middle line:84%
And I feel as though there's
a path for you as a healer.

00:42:06.322 --> 00:42:07.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even just
as someone that's

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:10.190 align:middle line:84%
social in an environment,
you're providing

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:11.480 align:middle line:90%
healing energy for people.

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:14.771 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you might not know
this, but just my own experience

00:42:14.771 --> 00:42:17.270 align:middle line:84%
so far, I just walked into this
building and then I met you,

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:20.100 align:middle line:84%
there was this-- I just had
a lovely moment with you.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you know
what you're transmitting,

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.280 align:middle line:90%
but I loved it.

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:24.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: Wow.

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:26.646 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: I mean,
just saying hi to you,

00:42:26.646 --> 00:42:28.960 align:middle line:84%
I was like, oh,
what a sweet man.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.551 align:middle line:84%
And so that speaks
to The Healer.

00:42:30.551 --> 00:42:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted
to ready one thing

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:34.730 align:middle line:84%
in The Healer part
of the book, and it

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:38.370 align:middle line:84%
says, "prayers are answered
when our vulnerability is

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:40.470 align:middle line:90%
equal to our desire.

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Judgment-- self-judgment
especially--

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:45.500 align:middle line:84%
locks debris in
the etheric body,

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:48.430 align:middle line:84%
blocking the self
from being fulfilled

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:50.600 align:middle line:90%
as it engages with reality.

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Find peace by harmonizing
with the sound

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:56.290 align:middle line:90%
of the softest, sweetest wind.

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:58.820 align:middle line:84%
The most vulnerable
part of you."

00:42:58.820 --> 00:42:59.950 align:middle line:90%
And you have this in you.

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:02.140 align:middle line:90%
You understand toxins.

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:05.340 align:middle line:84%
You're in a place of answering
a very important question.

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:08.750 align:middle line:84%
What is my value, and what
can I do next with that value?

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a great observer,
but I've done all the

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:12.650 align:middle line:90%
observing I need to, really.

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:15.860 align:middle line:84%
So as you look at this question
in this place is a difference,

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:19.380 align:middle line:84%
in this pause
between symphonies,

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:21.920 align:middle line:90%
think as vulnerably as you can.

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:22.730 align:middle line:90%
Open your heart.

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:25.560 align:middle line:84%
You know those little,
secret parts of the heart

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.250 align:middle line:90%
that nobody really knows about.

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Those sweet, little, tiny,
beautiful wishes and desires.

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:33.340 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
something in there.

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.900 align:middle line:90%
It might be very simple.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:37.380 align:middle line:84%
It might be a simple
daily behavior, a ritual,

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.210 align:middle line:84%
it might be a project,
a partnership,

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:42.000 align:middle line:84%
an individual you
haven't reached out to,

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.910 align:middle line:90%
but get in there.

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:46.960 align:middle line:84%
You're so good at sharing
your heart with others.

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:50.540 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to hear that you might
use some of that vulnerability

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and that understanding of your
vulnerability for yourself.

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:57.920 align:middle line:84%
To serve yourself with
your vulnerability.

00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:58.900 align:middle line:90%
Do something with it.

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Honor it, and I think you find
something really wonderful

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:02.760 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have a
question on this one.

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:05.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:09.590 align:middle line:84%
You said he's learned to
master toxicity to an extent.

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Is it also possible, when you
draw this card, that you've

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:16.340 align:middle line:84%
learned to kind of just
contain, or hold, or accept

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.520 align:middle line:84%
a certain amount of toxicity
also out of a sense of,

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.660 align:middle line:84%
jeez, I'm just not
ready to deal with it?

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:24.340 align:middle line:90%
And I can live alongside it.

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Is that what that
means, often, too?

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: That's right.

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:26.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just kind
of have to accept what is.

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: That's
right on the money.

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Until action happens?

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Mhmm.

00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:32.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:33.120 align:middle line:90%
And I started out.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.130 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to
get too into it,

00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:35.440 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't want
to kind of scrape too

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.773 align:middle line:90%
far beneath the surface, but I--

00:44:36.773 --> 00:44:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: Sure.

00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: In this idea
of setting boundaries

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:40.734 align:middle line:84%
with some people,
but you said it best,

00:44:40.734 --> 00:44:45.640 align:middle line:84%
where, what have you gotten
used to that's not good for you?

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:46.410 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's kind
of what I was feeling.

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know, but
that's what I was feeling.

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK: Well, I can say, not
in detail, why, I totally

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:55.854 align:middle line:90%
understand what you're saying.

00:44:55.854 --> 00:44:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: So this has
resonance for you.

00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:58.394 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: Yes, it does.

00:44:58.394 --> 00:44:59.120 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.578 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: This is
a time-- and it's

00:45:00.578 --> 00:45:02.660 align:middle line:84%
a time in consciousness'
evolution--

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:04.850 align:middle line:84%
it's a time to honor
the sweetest, most

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:06.520 align:middle line:90%
vulnerable parts of us.

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.140 align:middle line:84%
The universe is responding
dramatically to that.

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:11.710 align:middle line:84%
That all the light beings,
whether they're alien,

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:13.230 align:middle line:84%
or whatever
dimensions they're, on

00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:15.090 align:middle line:84%
whether they're
the archaic corners

00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:19.810 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual universe, or
our own guides and ancestors,

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:25.530 align:middle line:84%
they're ready to respond to the
sweetest, most simple, purest

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:26.910 align:middle line:90%
vibration of our desire.

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:31.340 align:middle line:84%
That really precious part of us
that we've covered up so much.

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:33.680 align:middle line:84%
It's time for you to
allow that for yourself,

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.960 align:middle line:84%
because you've got all the
goods inside of you, man.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: Wow.

00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:37.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very cool.

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: And that one.

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: And finally,
The Untouchable,

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:42.719 align:middle line:90%
which is an awesome card.

00:45:42.719 --> 00:45:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
Untouchable is awesome?

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: So The
Untouchable is living

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:51.580 align:middle line:84%
in front of a plate of glass
where nobody can touch him.

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And when you master toxins, when
you set appropriate boundaries

00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:58.230 align:middle line:84%
with people, and you
know how to do that,

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:00.540 align:middle line:84%
when you stop just
observing, but taking action

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:03.890 align:middle line:84%
on your wisdom, when you allow
that beautiful pause to turn

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:07.080 align:middle line:84%
into your own symphony
of vulnerability,

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.054 align:middle line:84%
you end up being
protected by the universe.

00:46:09.054 --> 00:46:10.470 align:middle line:84%
So no matter who's
yelling at you,

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:13.140 align:middle line:84%
or barking, or needing
something, you are focused

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:16.620 align:middle line:84%
on your own plans, and
bringing those to life

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:18.346 align:middle line:84%
will be a remarkable
experience for you.

00:46:18.346 --> 00:46:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I got chills.

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:20.320 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:20.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: Yeah.

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:21.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:27.000 align:middle line:84%
So this morning, my 3 and
1/2-year-old son looked at me

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.889 align:middle line:84%
out of the blue and said,
daddy, what do you have to lose?

00:46:30.889 --> 00:46:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Aw.

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god.

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:33.325 align:middle line:90%
Chills again.

00:46:33.325 --> 00:46:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: I kid you not.

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:35.780 align:middle line:90%
That is--

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:37.957 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From the
mouths of little angels.

00:46:37.957 --> 00:46:39.373 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK: He said
that this morning.

00:46:39.373 --> 00:46:40.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Aw.

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:41.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: That sums this
up better than I could've.

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:45.880 align:middle line:90%
What do you have to lose?

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:47.704 align:middle line:90%
That's a great, beautiful thing.

00:46:47.704 --> 00:46:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: This is great.

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:49.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.310 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:50.811 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:46:50.811 --> 00:46:51.851 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: You're welcome.

00:46:51.851 --> 00:46:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you have
any questions about it,

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:55.460 align:middle line:84%
or any kind of other
thoughts or observations?

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK: I'm just gonna
believe it, totally.

00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, there you go.

00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.079 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Might as well.

00:46:59.079 --> 00:47:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK: Yeah, because
it's awesome, right?

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:02.650 align:middle line:90%
So bad habits and bad people.

00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:03.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:05.170 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:06.080 align:middle line:90%
Work on those.

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, this is
a fantastic thing.

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Do you use intuition
as psychic ability?

00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:17.300 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how do you manifest.

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you wrote the
book, so you completely

00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.415 align:middle line:90%
understand the system.

00:47:21.415 --> 00:47:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I'm
really, really spooky,

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:27.040 align:middle line:84%
and I have a whole, big download
that comes in for somebody.

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And we're kind of
in a time thing

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:31.480 align:middle line:84%
here, so I didn't totally
open all the floodgates here,

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.990 align:middle line:84%
but I felt like we got
to the kernel of it.

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:36.580 align:middle line:84%
But I am very
intuitive, so that's

00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:39.550 align:middle line:90%
a big part of the process here.

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:43.100 align:middle line:84%
But I also stay out of
details, because I think people

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:44.499 align:middle line:90%
can get really caught up.

00:47:44.499 --> 00:47:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Am I gonna be that person,
and this is, and this?

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:48.373 align:middle line:84%
Because none of that
really so much happens.

00:47:48.373 --> 00:47:50.284 align:middle line:90%
That's for you to manage.

00:47:50.284 --> 00:47:51.700 align:middle line:84%
But intuition is
a big part of it.

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:54.570 align:middle line:84%
But we all have the
same access, and that's

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:56.510 align:middle line:84%
why I harp so much
on vulnerability

00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:57.920 align:middle line:90%
and the expression of emotion.

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.220 align:middle line:84%
So if we don't express
emotions, there's no learning,

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:03.950 align:middle line:84%
there's no embodiment
of the real lesson.

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:07.540 align:middle line:84%
But if we do do that,
we start to vibrate,

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:11.350 align:middle line:84%
and I call it an electromagnetic
experience of self.

00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:13.340 align:middle line:90%
Like we start to feel.

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:15.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, the more we
express, you actually

00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:19.340 align:middle line:84%
can feel that connectedness
to everything.

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
information comes from.

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're that
piece of electricity,

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:26.800 align:middle line:84%
that other electricity
is already connected.

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:29.820 align:middle line:84%
The truth is just going to come
in, because it's all current.

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Resonance.

00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: It's all
light and sound.

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:31.980 align:middle line:90%
It's all resonance.

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:32.480 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:33.539 align:middle line:90%
It'll just show up.

00:48:33.539 --> 00:48:35.830 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't do the work,
what ends up happening is,

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:37.955 align:middle line:84%
those emotions that are in
our kidneys, our livers,

00:48:37.955 --> 00:48:41.650 align:middle line:84%
our adrenals, those emotions,
they're smarter than we are.

00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:43.300 align:middle line:84%
They're more
powerful than we are.

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:46.640 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to
be magnetizing things

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:50.920 align:middle line:84%
to them because they want
to experience themselves.

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.417 align:middle line:84%
The hatred, the
anger, the oppression,

00:48:53.417 --> 00:48:55.500 align:middle line:84%
they're just going to bring
in more hatred, anger,

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:55.910 align:middle line:90%
and oppression.

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:56.544 align:middle line:90%
They're alive.

00:48:56.544 --> 00:48:57.460 align:middle line:90%
They're living beings.

00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:00.677 align:middle line:84%
It's like Dr. Masaru Emoto's
work with the water crystals.

00:49:00.677 --> 00:49:01.260 align:middle line:90%
It's the same.

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:02.210 align:middle line:90%
We're just water.

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:05.240 align:middle line:84%
So if we've already got
these things living in us,

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:07.120 align:middle line:90%
they're going to run our life.

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:10.960 align:middle line:84%
But if we move them
through us, we're

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.860 align:middle line:84%
actually vibrating
that beautiful crystal,

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:14.890 align:middle line:84%
that perfect water
crystal of joy,

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:16.772 align:middle line:90%
because we've done that work.

00:49:16.772 --> 00:49:19.105 align:middle line:84%
So I always like to say when
people are using the cards,

00:49:19.105 --> 00:49:22.400 align:middle line:84%
yes, I'm intuitive, which
is sometimes of value.

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:25.870 align:middle line:84%
What's most of value is you
processing your emotions,

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:28.840 align:middle line:84%
and you'll find that
channel for yourself.

00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And you in particular
have an ability,

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:34.910 align:middle line:84%
because you already know
how to open your heart.

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:37.220 align:middle line:84%
We were just saying, that's
the most important thing

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:40.159 align:middle line:84%
in the world is allowing
yourself to do that.

00:49:40.159 --> 00:49:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK: Well, I'm
grateful for this moment.

00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:43.107 align:middle line:90%
This is wonderful.

00:49:43.107 --> 00:49:43.940 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:44.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: We're grateful, too.

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:45.539 align:middle line:90%
That was lovely.

00:49:45.539 --> 00:49:46.830 align:middle line:90%
Really lovely to spend time on.

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we have
a few minutes left.

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:49.358 align:middle line:84%
I just drew one card
in the dressing room

00:49:49.358 --> 00:49:53.902 align:middle line:84%
before coming out here, and
it's number 64, The Outrageous.

00:49:53.902 --> 00:49:54.485 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yes.

00:49:54.485 --> 00:49:55.151 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So OK.

00:49:55.151 --> 00:49:56.100 align:middle line:90%
What's up?

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:57.114 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: All right.

00:49:57.114 --> 00:49:59.530 align:middle line:84%
The Outrageous, this is actually
one of my favorite cards,

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:01.600 align:middle line:84%
and the reason being
is, I think we all

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:04.680 align:middle line:84%
walk around the world, most
of us, myself included.

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:06.500 align:middle line:84%
We adopt a couple
of personalities,

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and personalities
are really temporary.

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.682 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to align
ourselves with and defend

00:50:11.682 --> 00:50:12.390 align:middle line:90%
that personality.

00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:13.970 align:middle line:90%
They're temporary.

00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:17.020 align:middle line:84%
But we've been walking
around this world.

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:21.202 align:middle line:84%
We come out of the womb in a
very intense operating room.

00:50:21.202 --> 00:50:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, we
have an experience.

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:23.730 align:middle line:90%
That's culture.

00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:25.400 align:middle line:90%
We go into a family.

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:26.550 align:middle line:90%
That's culture.

00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:27.640 align:middle line:90%
That's confined.

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:28.470 align:middle line:90%
There's a religion.

00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:30.175 align:middle line:90%
There's a work belief.

00:50:30.175 --> 00:50:32.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all these things
are imposed upon us.

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They create
a persona or two.

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Huge.

00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:36.340 align:middle line:90%
And these layers.

00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know, we're
always looking at the sky,

00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:41.870 align:middle line:84%
but if our sky is
these layers, that's

00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:44.907 align:middle line:84%
what we think the
expanded universe is.

00:50:44.907 --> 00:50:46.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we're
going to fulfill.

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:48.380 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
fulfill-- You know,

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.700 align:middle line:84%
we're going to connect
with that and embody it.

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:53.130 align:middle line:84%
But The Outrageous
says, you know what.

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:54.222 align:middle line:90%
You know, this is a man.

00:50:54.222 --> 00:50:55.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to put
on a dress and I'm

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.380 align:middle line:90%
going to go dance by a stream.

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
all of our potential,

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:06.450 align:middle line:84%
is to live on our own terms and
to defend those terms with joy.

00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:10.824 align:middle line:84%
And I always say, whatever
it is that you want to do,

00:51:10.824 --> 00:51:12.240 align:middle line:84%
even that little
thing that you're

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.698 align:middle line:84%
feeling like, oh, those people
are going to think I'm nuts,

00:51:14.698 --> 00:51:17.280 align:middle line:84%
you know, because we build
these lives, and then, well,

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:20.240 align:middle line:84%
this life, even if we
look at it objectively,

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.800 align:middle line:84%
it should do the
following things.

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:23.719 align:middle line:84%
This is what that
person should do.

00:51:23.719 --> 00:51:24.760 align:middle line:90%
But that's not even true.

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:26.260 align:middle line:84%
No matter what life
we've built, you

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:27.862 align:middle line:84%
can still step out
of that form, that

00:51:27.862 --> 00:51:29.320 align:middle line:84%
construct, even if
it's feeding you

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:30.486 align:middle line:90%
financially and emotionally.

00:51:30.486 --> 00:51:33.520 align:middle line:84%
You can still step out and
shout to the world whatever

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.760 align:middle line:84%
it is you want to shout,
and whatever your dance is,

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:36.970 align:middle line:90%
you can still do it.

00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:38.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
the outrageous is.

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:39.255 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:39.255 --> 00:51:42.325 align:middle line:84%
That actually was probably a
perfect card for me to draw.

00:51:42.325 --> 00:51:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Nice.

00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because I can
get stuck in persona,

00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:48.430 align:middle line:84%
you know, and then stuck
in whatever the mode is

00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:50.220 align:middle line:84%
that I have to keep
driving forward with,

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and not even stop
to think and express

00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:55.609 align:middle line:84%
what I really want to
express or feel in life.

00:51:55.609 --> 00:51:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Right on.

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:57.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I'll
get trapped inside.

00:51:57.310 --> 00:51:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed here,
this is really fun.

00:51:59.100 --> 00:51:59.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:02.200 align:middle line:84%
So along with all this
comes a coloring book.

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:05.200 align:middle line:84%
So I turned to
the coloring book.

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.220 align:middle line:90%
64, The Outrageous.

00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:08.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's a little workbook.

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:10.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah you can bring your crayons.

00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:11.080 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of cool.

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:13.600 align:middle line:84%
But then you have to
start kind of going

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:17.740 align:middle line:84%
through how this is affect--
how this interfaces with you.

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:19.420 align:middle line:84%
What you're afraid
of, what you think

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:22.440 align:middle line:84%
isn't happening, what you think
is, what you think you can,

00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:23.990 align:middle line:84%
what you think
you're blocked about.

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:26.323 align:middle line:84%
You have to kind of go through
the whole process of self

00:52:26.323 --> 00:52:29.257 align:middle line:84%
evaluation by the time you're
done with your crayons.

00:52:29.257 --> 00:52:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: It's nice.

00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then you
have to rate yourself.

00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:33.767 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: You rate
this part of you.

00:52:33.767 --> 00:52:36.100 align:middle line:84%
So in the way the book is
structured, and the workbook--

00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's cool.

00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:39.068 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: It's nice, because
you get to walk through.

00:52:39.068 --> 00:52:41.660 align:middle line:84%
You walk through humanity,
which is within us.

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And by grieving it,
releasing it, letting go,

00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:47.684 align:middle line:84%
expanding some pieces, we
become closer to ourselves.

00:52:47.684 --> 00:52:49.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I
made the workbook.

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:49.453 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:52:49.453 --> 00:52:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And you said that when
you go into groups

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.965 align:middle line:84%
of corporate or whatever,
and you do all of this--

00:52:52.965 --> 00:52:54.290 align:middle line:84%
this is part of my
deck, so I'm keeping it.

00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:55.164 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Oh, you go.

00:52:55.164 --> 00:52:56.325 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's your deck.

00:52:56.325 --> 00:52:56.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: OK.

00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Anyway.

00:52:57.330 --> 00:52:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And that when you go
into these groups,

00:52:58.750 --> 00:53:00.350 align:middle line:84%
you have them work with
these coloring books,

00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:02.030 align:middle line:84%
and they go into
depth on whatever it

00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:05.049 align:middle line:84%
is, whether it's outrageous,
or, you know, any of them.

00:53:05.049 --> 00:53:05.590 align:middle line:90%
The observer.

00:53:05.590 --> 00:53:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
kind of think, yeah.

00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:07.830 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Where am I blocking
myself there?

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:11.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
good self analysis.

00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:13.067 align:middle line:84%
So it's very cool
how you set it up.

00:53:13.067 --> 00:53:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: And forgiveness.

00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And forgiveness.

00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:15.409 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:15.409 --> 00:53:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WAGNER: I mean, the
core of it is forgiving

00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:21.030 align:middle line:84%
each past aspect of humanity,
and that allows you to forgive

00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:23.030 align:middle line:84%
each aspect within
you, and there's

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:26.520 align:middle line:84%
freedom, and compassion, and
it can be a lovely thing,

00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.270 align:middle line:84%
because we all got
these things we've been

00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:29.480 align:middle line:90%
holding onto for a long time.

00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:30.313 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All of us.

00:53:30.313 --> 00:53:32.244 align:middle line:84%
And on that note,
thank you so much.

00:53:32.244 --> 00:53:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: My pleasure.

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:35.085 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And thank you for
being vulnerable and doing

00:53:35.085 --> 00:53:35.330 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:53:35.330 --> 00:53:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah, that was lovely.

00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:36.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This was great.

00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MARK: That was a good time.

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:37.885 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:53:37.885 --> 00:53:39.593 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the name
of the book, again,

00:53:39.593 --> 00:53:41.680 align:middle line:84%
is "The Field Guide
to Human Personality,"

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.680 align:middle line:84%
and the cards as well,
and the coloring book.

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.730 align:middle line:84%
You can get this at any
major bookseller, right?

00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:46.355 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yeah.

00:53:46.355 --> 00:53:47.782 align:middle line:90%
I just got into Barnes & Noble.

00:53:47.782 --> 00:53:49.365 align:middle line:10%
I'm all throughout
Colorado right now,

00:53:49.365 --> 00:53:50.802 align:middle line:10%
but it's just starting to grow.

00:53:50.802 --> 00:53:51.760 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:52.920 align:middle line:10%
>>WAGNER: And I have a
cute little website, which

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:54.380 align:middle line:10%
is probably on your screen.

00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:56.740 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And you have number
two and three coming up.

00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:58.410 align:middle line:10%
Volumes two and three also
will be coming up as well.

00:53:58.410 --> 00:53:58.502 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yes.

00:53:58.502 --> 00:53:58.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:58.770 --> 00:53:59.845 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
is the beginning.

00:53:59.845 --> 00:54:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Yes.

00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:01.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's nice and plump.

00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:02.640 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot to
work with there.

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:03.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Right on.

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, thank
you so much, Paul.

00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>>WAGNER: Thank you.

00:54:04.690 --> 00:54:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Until
next time, thank you

00:54:05.290 --> 00:54:07.450 align:middle line:90%
for joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:14.300 align:middle line:10%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:14.800 align:middle line:90%
