>>REGINA MEREDITH: You've
all heard of "Joseph

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.520 align:middle line:10%
and His Technicolor Dreamcoat."

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.170 align:middle line:10%
Joseph's gift was
the gift of dreaming.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.020 align:middle line:84%
The gift we're going
to share with you today

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.770 align:middle line:90%
was also the gift of dreaming.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.570 align:middle line:84%
You, too, have a technicolor
dreamcoat that Connie Kaplan

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.570 align:middle line:90%
calls your invisible garment.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.520 align:middle line:84%
This beautiful method of
understanding self and soul

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.340 align:middle line:84%
was brought forward when
Connie was spending nearly all

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.514 align:middle line:84%
of her time sleeping, which
wasn't a good thing, right.

00:00:52.514 --> 00:00:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CONNIE KAPLAN: Well.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
it turned out--

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: In
retrospect, it was fine.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, in
retrospect it was fine.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.710 align:middle line:84%
But it was a challenging
time in your life.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.780 align:middle line:84%
You weren't sleeping because
you wanted to necessarily.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what was going
on in your life at that time.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:10%
>>KAPLAN: Yes, you know, I
was in my mid 30s, late 30s.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.590 align:middle line:10%
I had a great career, a great
marriage, wonderful child,

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.692 align:middle line:10%
Saab convertible.

00:01:16.692 --> 00:01:17.775 align:middle line:90%
Everything was going well.

00:01:17.775 --> 00:01:18.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Living it large.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Uh huh.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Fast lane, working in
the television industry

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.350 align:middle line:90%
in Los Angeles.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.740 align:middle line:90%
And one day, I woke up sick.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And I went to work
anyway because that's

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.210 align:middle line:90%
what you do in television.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.532 align:middle line:84%
And by noon, I was just--
I wasn't functional.

00:01:32.532 --> 00:01:34.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they had to get
somebody drive me home.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, all right,
well, I've got the flu.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.480 align:middle line:90%
And that'll last for a while.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And then, well, I started on
the downward spiral, and I

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.912 align:middle line:90%
just-- I lost my mind.

00:01:44.912 --> 00:01:46.120 align:middle line:90%
It's basically what happened.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Something was going on in my
brain, and I lost synapses,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.900 align:middle line:84%
you know, like, the
doorbell would ring

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.980 align:middle line:84%
and I could not remember
what you were supposed to do.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Or the phone would ring,
and I could not figure out

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.310 align:middle line:90%
how to get it to stop.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.526 align:middle line:84%
It was just-- I lost all
kinds of basic, you know--

00:02:03.526 --> 00:02:04.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cognitive skills.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Cognitive
skills, yeah.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Um, and I just could
not stay awake,

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.247 align:middle line:90%
just could not stay awake.

00:02:13.247 --> 00:02:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What happened--
what did you have?

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Well, it was
not ever really diagnosed,

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.640 align:middle line:84%
other than there was a
viral infection in my brain.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And that was during the
time-- that was, like,

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.760 align:middle line:84%
pretty on the early end of all
those immune deficiency things,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.561 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:32.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Ep--
Epstein-Barr and--

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Chronic Fatigue, yeah.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And all that.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Right.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And all of those were basically
blamed on the patient,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.000 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.090 align:middle line:84%
It's your fault. There's
something wrong with you.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.631 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
they've since learned

00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:48.370 align:middle line:84%
it's an auto immune deficiency,
oftentimes virally inspired.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: So many years later,
I finally got a diagnosis

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.700 align:middle line:84%
that it was a viral
infection in the brain.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.410 align:middle line:84%
But at the time,
you know, thousands

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.160 align:middle line:84%
of tests, it seemed--
thousands of dollars

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.650 align:middle line:84%
worth of tests, at least,
couldn't find anything wrong

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.480 align:middle line:90%
with me.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.029 align:middle line:84%
So, um, the doctor finally
just said to my husband, look,

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:08.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
it is, but it's not

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.260 align:middle line:84%
going to kill her so
just let her sleep.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.060 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.850 align:middle line:84%
I slept probably like
15, 18 hours a day

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.390 align:middle line:90%
for a couple of years.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have a
question at this point.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Hm mm.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.980 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be talking
about the soul in this,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and do-- this-- do you feel
in hindsight that this was

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:84%
divinely orchestrated so you
could be out of your mind

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and set your mind
aside for a while.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Say-- I'm not
going to say that because I

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.160 align:middle line:84%
have such an aversion to the
blame the victim mentality

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.060 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say,
you know, the disease was

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.826 align:middle line:90%
caused by something.

00:03:47.826 --> 00:03:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I mean, do you
think it was a perfect time,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.900 align:middle line:84%
like a perfect storm, so you
could set your mind aside?

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Yes, I think that--
I think I had to go offline.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly,
that's what I'm saying.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.000 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Right.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: So I was
definitely offline.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Offline.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: And so the first thing
that happened after I finally

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.240 align:middle line:84%
woke up a little bit
was that I started

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.730 align:middle line:84%
realizing that I had
learned a lot about dreaming

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:13.760 align:middle line:90%
in the dream.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.450 align:middle line:84%
While I was asleep, teachers
had come to me again and again

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.550 align:middle line:84%
and again in, you
know, dreams that would

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.310 align:middle line:90%
come over and over and over.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So that was the first sort of
mystical experience that I had.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately
started teaching

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.699 align:middle line:84%
what I had learned about
dreaming at that time.

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.990 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what we're
here to talk about today so--

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what started
being-- coming through you,

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and how your brain
started assembling it.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah, I just--
I would look at my dreams.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And for example, there
was this one woman

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.620 align:middle line:84%
that would show up in
my dreams fairly often.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And she would gather a
group of women together.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And she would take
us into a cave.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And she would have us
reproduce the drawings that

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.740 align:middle line:84%
were on the walls of
the cave as if we were

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.500 align:middle line:84%
in one of those caves
in France, you know,

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.124 align:middle line:84%
where all those
wonderful drawings are.

00:05:13.124 --> 00:05:15.090 align:middle line:84%
We would reproduce
them in some way.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And then, if she was pleased
with what we were doing,

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.720 align:middle line:90%
we could take a nap.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.820 align:middle line:84%
So you get to take
a nap in a dream.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.830 align:middle line:84%
That's like a very
special thing.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, she would--
as we went to sleep,

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.690 align:middle line:84%
she would point out the
wall-- the door of the cave,

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and there would
be the full moon.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't realize it
while this was going on,

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.030 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't connect hardly
any dots while it was going on.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.260 align:middle line:84%
But a couple years
later, I realized

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.040 align:middle line:84%
she was telling us
something about the moon.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And so I looked up
on a lunar calendar

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.530 align:middle line:90%
when I had those dreams.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.870 align:middle line:84%
So this woman had
come in a dream

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.430 align:middle line:84%
every full moon for
13 straight months.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.734 align:middle line:84%
So I started realizing,
all right, we

00:06:01.734 --> 00:06:03.150 align:middle line:84%
need to start
looking at the lunar

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.330 align:middle line:84%
influences on our dreaming, you
know, so that kind of thing.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:84%
It was just like kind of
connecting the dots in a very

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.570 align:middle line:90%
nontraditional way.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then,
at some point, you

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.600 align:middle line:84%
started getting a body
of information that

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.760 align:middle line:90%
took a while to assimilate.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Right.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.935 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
again, I think it's

00:06:21.935 --> 00:06:24.540 align:middle line:84%
important to point out that
you were into your Saab,

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.580 align:middle line:84%
you know, your life,
your family, your work.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:84%
You were not particularly prone
toward metaphysical thought

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.270 align:middle line:90%
or contemplation.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Exactly.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is all coming
out of seemingly nowhere.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Right.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.058 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: So I do have
to start by saying

00:06:39.058 --> 00:06:40.490 align:middle line:90%
my father was a minister.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.630 align:middle line:84%
So I did grow up in a household
where at least religion,

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:84%
and to a certain extent also
spirituality, was, you know,

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.920 align:middle line:90%
dominant.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.850 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I'd been
churched half to death

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.058 align:middle line:90%
by the time I got to college.

00:06:54.058 --> 00:06:57.020 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, out of the
house, I kind of went wild.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really
participate in any kind

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:06.700 align:middle line:84%
of religious stuff between then
and when I was in my late 30s.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.290 align:middle line:84%
Um, so no, I was not in
the practice of any kind

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:14.720 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual work really.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.060 align:middle line:84%
So now, it's a few
years after I've

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.030 align:middle line:84%
been teaching this dreaming
work, and my father is dying.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And so my sisters and I
go home to be with him

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.630 align:middle line:90%
during his last days.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out that I was
actually in the room with him

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:33.880 align:middle line:90%
in his last few hours.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting by his bed
and holding his hand and kind

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.410 align:middle line:84%
of, you know, for a girl
who doesn't pray, praying,

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.680 align:middle line:84%
you know, and just kind of
saying, look, he's ready to go.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Why keep pumping these lungs
and pumping this heart?

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.930 align:middle line:90%
He's, you know, it's done.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And I heard the
door open behind me.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.290 align:middle line:84%
But this was, like,
just prior to dawn

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.695 align:middle line:84%
so I knew it wasn't
visitors coming in.

00:07:55.695 --> 00:07:58.070 align:middle line:84%
So I thought it must have been
a nurse coming in to check

00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.280 align:middle line:90%
his vitals or something.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.080 align:middle line:90%
I stood up and turned around.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And there were two
angels in the room,

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:10.330 align:middle line:84%
big, tall, backlit,
dressed sort of like John

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.650 align:middle line:90%
Travolta in "Michael."

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:12.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.250 align:middle line:90%


00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love that film.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: And I knew they were
angels because of the sense

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:19.910 align:middle line:90%
of love in the room.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.960 align:middle line:84%
It was just an
overwhelming sense of love.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And Regina, I was in
one of those moments

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.250 align:middle line:84%
where you-- I didn't
believe in angels, right.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: So you've either got
to go with your experience,

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and experience something that
you don't believe can happen.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Or you've got to cut
the experience off

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.820 align:middle line:84%
so you can be faithful
to your belief system.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, most
people stay faithful

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.420 align:middle line:90%
to their belief system.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.424 align:middle line:84%
But in that moment,
I was kind of too--

00:08:48.424 --> 00:08:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
you're vulnerable.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.020 align:middle line:90%
Your father's passing.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.550 align:middle line:90%
You're very vulnerable and open.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.650 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:55.885 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of decided to
go with the experience

00:08:55.885 --> 00:08:56.685 align:middle line:90%
in that nanosecond.

00:08:56.685 --> 00:09:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And-- and, um, but still I was
kind of sarcastic and whatever.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And I said, why'd
you use the door.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.160 align:middle line:90%
And they go--

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Angels
don't need doors.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.353 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: You don't need a door.

00:09:08.353 --> 00:09:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we're here
to open all the portals.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.160 align:middle line:90%
And I kind of went, whoa.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.890 align:middle line:84%
So they talked to me
for a little while.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And they said, there's
a body of information

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.490 align:middle line:90%
that we need written down.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:23.540 align:middle line:84%
There are things
that most people

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:28.190 align:middle line:84%
are misunderstanding about
what the human incarnation is.

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And those corrections--
those misunderstandings

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.240 align:middle line:84%
need to be corrected
if the human species is

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.990 align:middle line:90%
going to evolve.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's OK if you
don't want to evolve.

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.780 align:middle line:84%
But if you're going to
evolve, a few changes

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.110 align:middle line:84%
need to be made in your
understanding of why

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:47.740 align:middle line:90%
you are embodied.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.230 align:middle line:84%
So we need you to
write this down.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was not in the
mood to become, like,

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.670 align:middle line:84%
one of those people that sits on
a stage and goes into a trance

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and starts-- you know, I
just, that-- I-- that wasn't

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.730 align:middle line:90%
my world.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.915 align:middle line:84%
So I said, yeah, no, I don't-- I
could refer you to some people.

00:10:08.915 --> 00:10:09.785 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:09.785 --> 00:10:09.834 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.834 --> 00:10:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: And they
just said, uh--

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's funny.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.545 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: They laughed,
and they said, do you

00:10:13.545 --> 00:10:16.050 align:middle line:84%
know who you're talking
to, negotiating here

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.150 align:middle line:84%
with the angels of death
or something, right.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.890 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK, eventually, I
said, OK, well, tell me more

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.280 align:middle line:90%
about this body of information.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And so they just blasted
me or something happened.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And I suddenly found myself, my
consciousness in this dimension

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:41.110 align:middle line:84%
that I can only describe
as sound, color, and form.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:46.410 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of walking through a
forest of neon geometric shapes

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:50.540 align:middle line:84%
and hearing tones
coming out of the colors

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:59.200 align:middle line:84%
and, um-- yeah, it was just
this amazing experience.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.960 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I was
in the place where

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.830 align:middle line:84%
all the answers are, which
some people would call God.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.490 align:middle line:84%
I knew that if I could
think of a question,

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:10.865 align:middle line:84%
it would be answered
immediately.

00:11:10.865 --> 00:11:13.156 align:middle line:84%
But when you're in the place
where all the answers are,

00:11:13.156 --> 00:11:14.410 align:middle line:90%
there aren't any questions.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:18.470 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't like I
could test or, you know,

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.360 align:middle line:84%
learn anything there,
except everything

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.620 align:middle line:84%
seemed to have been
downloaded in those about

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.620 align:middle line:90%
45 minutes that I was there.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.020 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of came back
into the room eventually.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.545 align:middle line:84%
And I said, all right,
I'll write it down but--

00:11:32.545 --> 00:11:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you came back
with structural memory?

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Uh huh.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:36.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of all of this?

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.801 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: It's kind of
like a lot of people

00:11:39.801 --> 00:11:43.140 align:middle line:84%
describe as an NDE, a
near-death experience,

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:47.200 align:middle line:84%
where they actually go to the
other side and then come back.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.842 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't my death.

00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:49.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: It was somebody
else's death but whatever.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.730 align:middle line:84%
It was-- it's-- I-- I sense
a familiarity when I talk

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:58.110 align:middle line:84%
to people that have had
NDEs, with the experience.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:00.420 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I said,
I'll write it down,

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:04.434 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not going
to tell anybody.

00:12:04.434 --> 00:12:05.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.930 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Right.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean,
thus, here you are now.

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:12.891 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have not exactly
been promoting your work.

00:12:12.891 --> 00:12:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: No, I haven't.

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:15.373 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: I haven't.

00:12:15.373 --> 00:12:18.960 align:middle line:84%
But that's-- they said
to me, you write it down.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:84%
We'll send you the people
that need to know it.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll take care
of that side of it.

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:25.119 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:26.035 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Here we are.

00:12:26.035 --> 00:12:26.993 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Here you are.

00:12:26.993 --> 00:12:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.600 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the body of knowledge.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Before we even get into
the body of knowledge,

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.270 align:middle line:84%
this whole notion that
we're unclear on the point

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.510 align:middle line:84%
of our incarnations
on the planet.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:40.190 align:middle line:90%
Let's start there.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: OK.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
said, well, let

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:48.330 align:middle line:84%
me just say that over the
next three or four months

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:49.762 align:middle line:84%
was when this body
of information

00:12:49.762 --> 00:12:50.720 align:middle line:90%
started coming through.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.570 align:middle line:84%
I would get up in the
middle of the night

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:53.930 align:middle line:90%
and do a little writing.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:56.270 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like trance writing
or anything like that.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.830 align:middle line:84%
It was just, I
knew what to write

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:59.895 align:middle line:84%
down at 3 o'clock in
the morning, right.

00:12:59.895 --> 00:13:00.695 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:00.695 --> 00:13:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: And so over
the next few months,

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.100 align:middle line:84%
this body of information
had come through.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
important parts of it

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:11.650 align:middle line:84%
is most people think
that you're here

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:19.920 align:middle line:84%
to do something, accomplish
something, uh, you know,

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.700 align:middle line:84%
put something out
into the world,

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.730 align:middle line:90%
and get money back for it.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Or some people-- most people--
most people-- a lot of people

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:31.030 align:middle line:84%
think you're here
to learn lessons.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
here think you're here

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.640 align:middle line:84%
to do something with karma, burn
off karma or create karma or do

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.930 align:middle line:84%
something with that
reciprocity kind of energy.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no,
it's none of that.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.150 align:middle line:90%
You are here to deliver a gift.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.820 align:middle line:84%
That's all you're here to
do is to deliver the gift.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And the way you deliver
the gift is to be the gift.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.960 align:middle line:84%
The gift comes from
the level of soul.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't come
from your willfulness.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:05.270 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't come from your
mental, rational mind.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:09.680 align:middle line:84%
It is a gift from soul that
wants to be embodied in form.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And all you have
to do is give it.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.880 align:middle line:90%
So that's kind of radical.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And it-- you know, they
emphasize that being the gift

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.540 align:middle line:84%
rather than doing anything is
your reason for incarnating.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.341 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hm mm.

00:14:27.341 --> 00:14:29.423 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: So whenever I
tell people that, they go,

00:14:29.423 --> 00:14:30.580 align:middle line:90%
oh my god, I can't do that.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.139 align:middle line:84%
Because if I just be, then
I'll just sit on the couch,

00:14:33.139 --> 00:14:35.430 align:middle line:84%
and I'll never do anything,
and then, I'll be homeless.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.096 align:middle line:84%
And I'll walk around
with all my clothes

00:14:37.096 --> 00:14:40.310 align:middle line:84%
in a-- you know,
in a grocery cart.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.380 align:middle line:90%
And I'll have bad hair.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.180 align:middle line:90%
I can't do that.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:42.585 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:14:42.585 --> 00:14:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: That's terrible.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.401 align:middle line:84%
I won't have any money,
and I'll starve to death.

00:14:45.401 --> 00:14:46.910 align:middle line:90%
It's not that at all.

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:47.810 align:middle line:90%
It's not that at all.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:53.450 align:middle line:84%
It's that if you learn to
be the gift that you are,

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:58.430 align:middle line:84%
you're doingness shows up in
front of you and says do me.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that
is authentically yours

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:06.276 align:middle line:84%
to do rather than
your having to make up

00:15:06.276 --> 00:15:07.400 align:middle line:90%
what you're supposed to do.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.066 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
doesn't mean that there

00:15:09.066 --> 00:15:11.730 align:middle line:84%
aren't some basic things or
skills or things you need

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:13.710 align:middle line:84%
to learn along the way
within the incarnation

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:16.090 align:middle line:90%
so you are able to express this.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Exactly,
because what-- you know,

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.120 align:middle line:84%
when you take an
incarnation as a human,

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:24.140 align:middle line:84%
then you have to
appear to be a human.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.690 align:middle line:84%
So you have this, you
have a mental body

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.750 align:middle line:84%
and an emotional body
and a physical body

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.270 align:middle line:90%
and an ethical body.

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And all of those bodies
have to work together

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:37.760 align:middle line:84%
to create this personality
through which the gift can

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.040 align:middle line:90%
be delivered.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So those bodies are combined
in the-- most people

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.250 align:middle line:84%
would call those the
ego, the ego body.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.670 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.620 align:middle line:90%
That's where free will is.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where
you can make choices.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And too often, because
of socialization,

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.810 align:middle line:84%
because of our
culturalization, we

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:04.900 align:middle line:84%
make choices that are not in
our best interest, you know,

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:09.780 align:middle line:84%
that are not coming from an
authentic space within us.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.820 align:middle line:84%
We make willful choices
that block our own gift

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.870 align:middle line:90%
from being received.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: See now, this is the
rub in all of it for humanity,

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.990 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And I guess that's why the body
of information came through

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.590 align:middle line:84%
is to start learning how to open
these channels of communication

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and start allowing yourselves
to express that unique thing

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.830 align:middle line:90%
that we each offer.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:36.860 align:middle line:84%
But when a person--
and I want to-- I

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:41.070 align:middle line:84%
want to get your impression
on how this works.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:45.220 align:middle line:84%
When a person feels, because
of societal conditioning,

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.240 align:middle line:84%
unable to hear their
own voice, their

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.020 align:middle line:84%
own higher voice,
whisper, whatever

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:53.680 align:middle line:84%
you want to call that,
from the soul, you do.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.430 align:middle line:84%
You have a lot of
suffering on the planet.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:57.931 align:middle line:84%
You have people working
as automatons almost,

00:16:57.931 --> 00:16:59.430 align:middle line:84%
just kind of getting
through the day

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:02.420 align:middle line:90%
to pay for the rent or whatnot.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:06.230 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about--
let's talk about that part

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:10.119 align:middle line:84%
now before we go into the
rest of the system itself,

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:13.390 align:middle line:84%
opening those means
of communication.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And then, the overlay of free
will once that's happened.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Yes, um, it-- a lot
of it has to do with vocabulary

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle line:84%
and how you ask
yourself the questions

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.060 align:middle line:84%
about what-- about doingness,
about what you are to do.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:40.930 align:middle line:84%
When you look up your
principles and discover

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:45.230 align:middle line:84%
what your invisible garment--
what your fiber-- the fiber

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:49.310 align:middle line:84%
of your being is,
what you realize is,

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:52.730 align:middle line:90%
I don't own these principles.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:57.530 align:middle line:84%
They are simply trying to
express through a personality.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:01.410 align:middle line:84%
So the real key is to
get out of the way.

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:05.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's really about subtracting
rather than adding anything.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.330 align:middle line:84%
It's about learning how
to get out of the way

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:15.250 align:middle line:84%
so that these principles can
just show up and call forth,

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.029 align:middle line:84%
you know, magnetize what
your next doingness step is.

00:18:18.029 --> 00:18:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And for
most people, that's

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.270 align:middle line:90%
very difficult because of fear.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Fear.

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:24.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All the things you
talked about right off the bat,

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.526 align:middle line:90%
but A, the big F, the F word.

00:18:26.526 --> 00:18:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah, the F word.

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The F word, and also
all these mental constructs

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.764 align:middle line:84%
of what life is supposed to look
like as you also talked about

00:18:33.764 --> 00:18:34.680 align:middle line:90%
in the very beginning.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.440 align:middle line:84%
So you have a lot
of noise happening

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.950 align:middle line:84%
from the conscious mind
and from the fear factor

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.410 align:middle line:90%
from the amygdala.

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And you have to-- you can't
hear yourself through that.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, basically, one can't
hear oneself through that.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.620 align:middle line:84%
So do you have any-- I mean,
I have a couple of things

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:53.930 align:middle line:90%
that I resonate with.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.020 align:middle line:84%
But what are some of the
things you resonate with?

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.655 align:middle line:84%
And having a person
assist themself

00:18:58.655 --> 00:19:01.030 align:middle line:84%
in getting out of their own
way so they can actually hear

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.940 align:middle line:90%
their voice, their true voice.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Well, one of the
things that you can do,

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:08.610 align:middle line:84%
which I find very interesting
is that you could sort of look

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:13.390 align:middle line:84%
back over your life and you
can find times when something

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:16.530 align:middle line:90%
happened that wasn't a result--

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Scripted.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: That
wasn't scripted, that

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:21.666 align:middle line:84%
wasn't a result of your willful,
you know, I'm going to do this,

00:19:21.666 --> 00:19:23.790 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to do this,
and I'm going to do this.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:27.880 align:middle line:84%
So some opportunity shows
up and presents itself

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:32.500 align:middle line:84%
because, in some moment,
all of your-- all

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.310 align:middle line:84%
of your socialization,
all of your

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:38.470 align:middle line:84%
should's, all of your
fears, have for some reason

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.960 align:middle line:90%
in that moment fallen away.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.520 align:middle line:90%
And there it was.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.500 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the things
that I tell people to do.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of a
recapitulation process, where

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:52.490 align:middle line:84%
you look backwards, and you mark
those times when it did happen.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And then, you memorize what
it felt like in that moment

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:57.720 align:middle line:90%
when it did happen.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.845 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, the feeling.

00:19:58.845 --> 00:20:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: And what is--
because the ability to live

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:06.360 align:middle line:84%
without fear or the ability
to at least negotiate

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:10.860 align:middle line:84%
with the amygdala, you
can express fear only

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.267 align:middle line:90%
when there's a bear behind me.

00:20:12.267 --> 00:20:13.067 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise--

00:20:13.067 --> 00:20:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: You know.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're not--
we're not living that way.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: We're not going to
sit here and make up stuff

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:18.826 align:middle line:90%
to be afraid of anymore.

00:20:18.826 --> 00:20:19.626 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:19.626 --> 00:20:20.672 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: So.

00:20:20.672 --> 00:20:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
essentially what

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:23.870 align:middle line:84%
society does, which
essentially it's

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:25.580 align:middle line:90%
programmed to do exactly that.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: What if, what
if, what if, what if.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.668 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it
keeps you in a state

00:20:28.668 --> 00:20:33.460 align:middle line:84%
of neediness and dependency
on all systems and structures.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're talking about
is this a person breaking free

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:40.390 align:middle line:84%
of all systems and
structures and fear itself.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I look at it
on a really simple level.

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:45.230 align:middle line:84%
I remember when my
son was quite young,

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:50.280 align:middle line:84%
teaching him to make
decisions under his own steam

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.630 align:middle line:90%
when he was still young.

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And I said, honey,
you can feel it.

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:57.500 align:middle line:84%
You'll find a lifting or
a sinking in the stomach.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I always
explained it to him.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.250 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
contemplating something,

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.150 align:middle line:84%
see how it's feeling
in your body.

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.302 align:middle line:84%
And butterflies are not to
be confused with anxiety.

00:21:07.302 --> 00:21:08.885 align:middle line:84%
These are different
kinds of feelings.

00:21:08.885 --> 00:21:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yes, exactly.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, you
go through what they were.

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And it really is a feeling
state to feel your way

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.570 align:middle line:90%
to a little more openness.

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And there are 1,000
techniques to do it.

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:24.110 align:middle line:90%
So you're saying the same thing.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:27.800 align:middle line:84%
You're saying, go back and do a
little forensics on your life,

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.090 align:middle line:84%
find out when these things
happen, what frame of mind

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:30.890 align:middle line:90%
was I in.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:32.080 align:middle line:90%
What was I thinking?

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And your right on, some
of the biggest turning

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:38.310 align:middle line:84%
points in my life happened when
my defenses were totally down.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:40.680 align:middle line:84%
You do-- in fact, when
you've thrown in the towel.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.687 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Hm mm.

00:21:41.687 --> 00:21:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you know what, I
have your chart here.

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Can I talk about
you a little bit?

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:45.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I--

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Do you
mind if I do that?

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know someone sent
you that info and you got it.

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:49.789 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Someone
sent me this info.

00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A mutual
friend, a lovely woman.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: So, um, we-- we'll
talk a little bit about how one

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.450 align:middle line:84%
finds out one's principles
and one's, right--

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:03.499 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: One's garment weave.

00:22:03.499 --> 00:22:05.350 align:middle line:84%
But what I want
to say about yours

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:10.140 align:middle line:84%
is that your primary gift, the
principle that we call your sun

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:14.030 align:middle line:84%
principle, your primary reason
for taking this incarnation

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:16.720 align:middle line:90%
is the principle of dreaming.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, dreaming-- all
of these principles,

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.090 align:middle line:90%
I had to give words to them.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:24.348 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: But all
of the words mean

00:22:24.348 --> 00:22:25.970 align:middle line:84%
something slightly
different than they

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:29.050 align:middle line:90%
do in our mundane vernacular.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:32.040 align:middle line:84%
So dreaming as a
spiritual practice

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:40.050 align:middle line:84%
is about being able to hear
the information of the void,

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:45.140 align:middle line:84%
being able to hear, go
into that great cosmic soup

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:50.770 align:middle line:84%
of all potential and hear the
information that is ready to be

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:52.260 align:middle line:90%
brought into consciousness.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.510 align:middle line:90%
That's what dreaming is.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:57.380 align:middle line:84%
So you are, by
nature, a dreamer.

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:02.050 align:middle line:84%
You are, by nature, the most--
the most deeply embedded piece

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:06.160 align:middle line:84%
of your garment is that you
can hear information out

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:06.960 align:middle line:90%
of the void.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.709 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes, that
will come when you're

00:23:08.709 --> 00:23:10.390 align:middle line:90%
asleep in the form of a dream.

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it comes in
the form of daydreams.

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it just pops
at you in those rare moments

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:22.830 align:middle line:84%
when fear and should's and--
and willfulness have just

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:24.490 align:middle line:90%
fallen away for a moment.

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: So-- so
that's what I would

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:32.480 align:middle line:84%
say to you if you were coming
to me for any kind of advice,

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.280 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:39.190 align:middle line:84%
I would say, you need to
learn how to really recognize

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:43.280 align:middle line:84%
valid information when it
shows up out of the void

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.610 align:middle line:84%
and learning the difference
between information

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:49.930 align:middle line:84%
that you've read
somewhere else and saying,

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.670 align:middle line:84%
oh, that person's smart, so
they must be telling the truth.

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:53.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: And recognizing
valid information

00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:00.417 align:middle line:84%
that comes up from the
cosmic soup of all potential.

00:24:00.417 --> 00:24:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And, again,
there's such a feeling

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:03.834 align:middle line:90%
that's attached to that.

00:24:03.834 --> 00:24:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Yes, of
course there is.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
OK, I want to tell

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.786 align:middle line:84%
a little story about the
show "Open Minds," which

00:24:08.786 --> 00:24:10.810 align:middle line:90%
is the show we're on right now.

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So initially what happened was,
about four years ago or so,

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.540 align:middle line:84%
before I was doing this,
I woke up one morning,

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:22.420 align:middle line:84%
and I saw myself on
a set with people.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.030 align:middle line:90%
And I was doing a show.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:29.711 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- and I was, just
do a pilot for it immediately.

00:24:29.711 --> 00:24:31.210 align:middle line:84%
I thought, whoa,
whoa, whoa, I don't

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:32.293 align:middle line:90%
need to do that right now.

00:24:32.293 --> 00:24:34.600 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of expensive to
hire a studio and all that.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.900 align:middle line:90%
But I always-- I listen.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.080 align:middle line:84%
When I get the
downloads, I listen.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.826 align:middle line:90%
So I did a little pilot.

00:24:39.826 --> 00:24:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turned out,
one of the cameras

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:42.770 align:middle line:90%
wasn't a match with the others.

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:43.879 align:middle line:90%
So the formatting was off.

00:24:43.879 --> 00:24:44.920 align:middle line:90%
It could never be edited.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.320 align:middle line:84%
It was just a mess
in post-production.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.240 align:middle line:84%
But I had ordered four
little mugs on it.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.747 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, hm, I've got
to call the show something.

00:24:51.747 --> 00:24:54.080 align:middle line:84%
I know, I'll call it "Open
Minds," because really that's

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.470 align:middle line:90%
what it comes down to.

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So I had four mugs with
"Open Minds" printed on them,

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.620 align:middle line:84%
on the little set at our little
round table discussion, right.

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.162 align:middle line:84%
So months later--
a few months later,

00:25:03.162 --> 00:25:05.703 align:middle line:84%
Pat-- and I kept looking at them
in the cupboard and thought,

00:25:05.703 --> 00:25:06.860 align:middle line:90%
what was that all about.

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.490 align:middle line:90%
What a waste of time.

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:09.900 align:middle line:90%
But I did it, you know.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.386 align:middle line:90%
It's not going anywhere.

00:25:11.386 --> 00:25:12.710 align:middle line:90%
But what was it about?

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.610 align:middle line:90%
And then, Gaiam called.

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And then, they said, once
we did this, they said,

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.628 align:middle line:84%
so what would you like
to call your show.

00:25:18.628 --> 00:25:21.200 align:middle line:90%
And I said, "Open Minds."

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's,
initially-- but for me,

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.970 align:middle line:84%
a lot happens in
that crossover state.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.520 align:middle line:84%
I wake up and I know things
or hear things and I do it.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Hm mm.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that something
like those kinds of things

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.702 align:middle line:84%
are like a demonstration
that you're willing.

00:25:36.702 --> 00:25:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: You know.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's what--
I mean, that is true.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: That's
all there is to it.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just have
to show up and say yes.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: But if you had pushed
and pushed and pushed and said,

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.400 align:middle line:84%
you know, dammit,
let's do this again.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.983 align:middle line:84%
And let's, you know, I'm going
to push, and I'm going to edit,

00:25:47.983 --> 00:25:49.475 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to,
you know, market.

00:25:49.475 --> 00:25:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to-- then,
it would have fallen

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.994 align:middle line:90%
into all kinds of willfullness.

00:25:52.994 --> 00:25:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Actually, all
I needed was the mugs.

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:55.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Exactly.

00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:59.690 align:middle line:84%
You could have skipped
the rest of it,

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:01.100 align:middle line:90%
saved yourself some money there.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.105 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
but I mean that--

00:26:02.105 --> 00:26:04.521 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: But no, you needed
to-- you needed to, I'm sure,

00:26:04.521 --> 00:26:07.522 align:middle line:84%
see what it was going
to look like, you know.

00:26:07.522 --> 00:26:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Theoretically, yes.

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:09.850 align:middle line:90%
But I do-- so I do.

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:10.650 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:12.990 align:middle line:84%
I relate to that dreaming
part because everything

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:16.010 align:middle line:84%
happens as a result of
daydreaming and crossover dream

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:17.370 align:middle line:90%
state messages.

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: For you.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For me.

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, we talked about
this off-camera.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.440 align:middle line:84%
That's not necessarily how
it happens for everybody.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Right.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the great gifts

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.250 align:middle line:90%
of this body of information.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: You begin to realize
that everyone is actually

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:34.840 align:middle line:84%
unique because that's one of
the hardest things, it seems,

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:35.880 align:middle line:90%
for people.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.450 align:middle line:84%
I think this way, and so if
you don't think this way,

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:41.816 align:middle line:84%
either you're wrong or you're
trying to make me wrong.

00:26:41.816 --> 00:26:43.190 align:middle line:84%
That's the way we
live our lives.

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we get into
so many arguments and wars

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:47.040 align:middle line:90%
and whatever.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And the inability of people to
recognize unique configurations

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:57.200 align:middle line:84%
of energy and value
them is, I mean,

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:00.170 align:middle line:84%
that's-- don't even get
me started on politics

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:01.820 align:middle line:90%
or economics or anything else.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.370 align:middle line:84%
But that's really what this
body of information is about,

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:08.320 align:middle line:84%
is recognizing that
each individual

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:15.000 align:middle line:84%
has a unique configuration
of energy and a unique fiber

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.350 align:middle line:90%
fabric.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And all of them, when
expressed well, create peace.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the words
themselves are powerful,

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.700 align:middle line:84%
and many of them are
very beautiful words.

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And the system-- I
told you after I'd

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.740 align:middle line:84%
read the book and all of this
and then chatted with you

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.240 align:middle line:84%
on the phone, I
said, you know, what

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:40.090 align:middle line:84%
I like about this
system, A, it rings true.

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:43.210 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it rings true
personally for me.

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:45.910 align:middle line:84%
So you know, you have something
to identify with a bit.

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:49.830 align:middle line:84%
But it was that it
has this grace to it.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:52.440 align:middle line:84%
There is no making--
there is no making

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.730 align:middle line:90%
you wrong in this system.

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Right.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is really
only identifying

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.360 align:middle line:84%
these incredible,
as you say, traits

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.940 align:middle line:84%
that you have come
to express, allowed

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.030 align:middle line:90%
to be expressed through you.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's really kind of
what people are looking for.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.639 align:middle line:84%
How many people are
wandering around the planet,

00:28:08.639 --> 00:28:09.860 align:middle line:90%
what am I doing here?

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.940 align:middle line:84%
What am I supposed
to do with my life?

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.140 align:middle line:90%
What's this all about?

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is really
the beauty, I think,

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.230 align:middle line:90%
of what your work shows is that.

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the work itself now.

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:21.670 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: All right.

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:22.470 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:26.630 align:middle line:84%
So as I said, after this
experience with my father's

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:31.610 align:middle line:84%
death, we did-- we went through
the business of his dying

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:34.396 align:middle line:84%
and burying and
doing all of that.

00:28:34.396 --> 00:28:35.520 align:middle line:90%
And then, I went back home.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, I
started waking up

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.750 align:middle line:84%
every night just about, around
3:00, 3:30 in the morning.

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:42.000 align:middle line:90%
And I would write for a while.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And then, after a few months,
this body of information

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:49.490 align:middle line:90%
had clarified itself.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:52.570 align:middle line:84%
There are 30
spiritual principles

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:58.125 align:middle line:84%
that interweave to create the
human species, the human form.

00:28:58.125 --> 00:29:00.710 align:middle line:90%


00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:02.950 align:middle line:84%
Those 30 spiritual
principles each have

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:07.360 align:middle line:84%
a numerological correspondence,
numbered 0 through 29.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.550 align:middle line:90%


00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Every sign in the
zodiac also has

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:17.950 align:middle line:84%
a numerological correspondence,
numbered 0 through 29.

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:20.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's how you
find your principles.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.860 align:middle line:84%
You look at your
natal chart, which is

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.390 align:middle line:90%
what I've done here with yours.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.640 align:middle line:84%
This is, like, just a
typical round natal chart.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: And you
look at the degrees

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:33.100 align:middle line:90%
of your various planets.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:37.890 align:middle line:84%
So your son is at 22
degrees of Scorpio.

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:42.420 align:middle line:84%
So on the chart, 22 corresponds
to the principle of dreaming.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So we know that dreaming is
your primary principle, and et

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:46.550 align:middle line:90%
cetera, et cetera.

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:51.010 align:middle line:84%
You go all the way through
the 12th, the sun and the moon

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:52.980 align:middle line:84%
and the eight planets
and the Midheaven.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there are
certain configuration

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:57.980 align:middle line:90%
of how you look at it.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you find out
what your principles are.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Then, the information
goes a little bit deeper.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:10.680 align:middle line:84%
The first 10 principles,
numbered 0 through 9,

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.570 align:middle line:84%
are directly
connected to nature.

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:16.770 align:middle line:84%
They are like principles that
are coming up out of the earth,

00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:18.750 align:middle line:84%
out of nature, out of
the animal kingdom,

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:21.710 align:middle line:84%
out of the stone
kingdom to be expressed

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:25.150 align:middle line:90%
through the human psyche.

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:27.930 align:middle line:84%
They're called the
ascending principles.

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:30.750 align:middle line:84%
The top 10 principles,
number 20 through 29,

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:33.640 align:middle line:84%
are-- we call-- what we call
the galactic principles.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.580 align:middle line:84%
They are principles
that can't even

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:40.090 align:middle line:84%
really be described, like
love and peace and silence.

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:43.520 align:middle line:84%
They're the very-- the highest
frequency of principles.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.320 align:middle line:84%
They are descending
to be expressed

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.990 align:middle line:90%
through human, the human realm.

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And then, the
middle 10 principles

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:52.780 align:middle line:84%
are called the containing
principles, numbered 10

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:53.870 align:middle line:90%
through 19.

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And they are the principles that
are very, very human in nature,

00:30:56.670 --> 00:31:01.470 align:middle line:84%
like creativity and
intelligence and focus.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:05.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you were looking
at this as a tree,

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:07.900 align:middle line:84%
the first 10 principles would
be the roots of the tree.

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.390 align:middle line:84%
The middle 10 principles would
be the trunk of the tree.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And the top 10 principles
would be the leaves.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Foliage.

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Yes, the light-eating
principles of the tree.

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:24.530 align:middle line:10%
>>KAPLAN: And they all function
together in a perfect way.

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:29.180 align:middle line:10%
There is no conflict between
ascending and descending

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:29.980 align:middle line:10%
principles.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.590 align:middle line:90%
They need each other, you know.

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:36.895 align:middle line:84%
The leaves cannot eat the
light without the roots.

00:31:36.895 --> 00:31:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: So that's what
the soul looks like.

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:43.750 align:middle line:84%
That's what the human
soul looks like.

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Can I go into talking
about the soul?

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: This is another piece
of this body of information

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:54.340 align:middle line:84%
that really asks people to
suspend your disbelief in order

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:57.720 align:middle line:90%
to think about this.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Most of us believe that it's
a one man, one soul world.

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:02.490 align:middle line:90%
I have a soul.

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:03.290 align:middle line:90%
You have a soul.

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:04.120 align:middle line:90%
He has a good soul.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.220 align:middle line:90%
She's an old soul.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.920 align:middle line:84%
That's the vocabulary
that we use.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.870 align:middle line:84%
These angels said, gotta
change that vocabulary

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:15.040 align:middle line:84%
because that's an
inaccurate way to say it.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.580 align:middle line:84%
The soul, the
level of human soul

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:21.440 align:middle line:84%
is one unified field
of consciousness.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:26.630 align:middle line:84%
It is this tree, this unified
field of consciousness

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:30.600 align:middle line:90%
from which all of us emanate.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.910 align:middle line:90%
But it is unified.

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:32.830 align:middle line:90%
It's not separate.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:36.750 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing when we
say your soul and my soul

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:40.420 align:middle line:84%
is that we're projecting
our sense of separation

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:43.730 align:middle line:84%
into a realm of consciousness
that is not separate,

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:46.880 align:middle line:84%
that is not separated,
that does not divide.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:53.100 align:middle line:84%
So they just ask that we use
that word as a unifying word,

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:56.060 align:middle line:84%
rather than as a separating
and identifying word.

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, this gets
confusing for people.

00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yes.

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you
get into a lot of other,

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.500 align:middle line:84%
you know, ancient
religious traditions

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.630 align:middle line:90%
and their definitions of soul.

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about this in our
conversation on the telephone

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:11.480 align:middle line:90%
a while back.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And that has--
this system is not

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:18.150 align:middle line:84%
to say it's not recognizing
the individuated aspect

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:21.980 align:middle line:84%
of that soul, that we are
each uniquely expressing.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: We are each
individuations of that soul.

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And in form, we're
experiencing ourselves

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:33.510 align:middle line:84%
as separate
individuations, in form.

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And tell us why, tell
us the damage that they felt

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:42.610 align:middle line:84%
was occurring on this
planet by people basically

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:45.360 align:middle line:84%
locking into the
individuated part

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.880 align:middle line:90%
and not focusing on the whole.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Well, the whole
is, the whole species

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.890 align:middle line:90%
is the experiment, see.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:34:01.720 align:middle line:84%
There are birds, and there are
tigers, and there are dogs,

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.360 align:middle line:84%
and there are lots of
different species, all of which

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.350 align:middle line:90%
are doing their own thing.

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:09.000 align:middle line:84%
But this experiment,
this human experiment,

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.710 align:middle line:84%
is one that we understand
as having free will.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:18.429 align:middle line:84%
So the experiment is, can
a species have free will

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:23.500 align:middle line:84%
and stay in full alignment
with their highest intentions.

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, how
we doing so far?

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah, not
doing so well so far.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:30.060 align:middle line:84%
That's why I think
they felt an urgency

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.594 align:middle line:84%
about bringing this body
of information in now.

00:34:33.594 --> 00:34:35.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's interesting
is, as you said,

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:37.080 align:middle line:84%
I published this
book 10 years ago.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So my sense of it was, OK, I'm
going to-- I'm going to-- well,

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.940 align:middle line:84%
wait, I have to say,
I didn't publish

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:44.721 align:middle line:90%
the book for a long time.

00:34:44.721 --> 00:34:46.679 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Didn't you--
you took another decade,

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:48.553 align:middle line:84%
didn't you, just to play
with it with friends

00:34:48.553 --> 00:34:50.040 align:middle line:84%
and see if there
was truth in it.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.846 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: I did over
3,000 soul readings.

00:34:52.846 --> 00:34:53.929 align:middle line:90%
I call them soul readings.

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:54.909 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 3,000, wow,
that's due diligence.

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:57.290 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Before I was--
before I was ready to say,

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.290 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is real and
I'm going to publish it.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:00.998 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
people were responding?

00:35:00.998 --> 00:35:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Yes, people
were responding.

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:04.640 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was amazing.

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example,
someone would come to me

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and I would see
in their pattern,

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:14.610 align:middle line:84%
that most of their principles
were ascending principles.

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And so I would say to
them, you're barely human.

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:20.320 align:middle line:90%
You're mostly a nature spirit.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.264 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:21.264 --> 00:35:23.430 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Which is kind of
a dangerous thing to say,

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:26.020 align:middle line:90%
could be a hurtful thing to say.

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:28.020 align:middle line:90%
But no, I would get tears.

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:29.842 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, I've
always known that.

00:35:29.842 --> 00:35:30.800 align:middle line:90%
I've always known that.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.490 align:middle line:84%
But I thought that was
what was wrong with me.

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:37.130 align:middle line:84%
This is what is so interesting
about this body of information.

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Often, what we find to be
true about our patterns

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:44.600 align:middle line:84%
is what we thought
was broken about us.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And so when we read
that that is actually

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:50.650 align:middle line:84%
what we came into this
incarnation to be,

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:53.750 align:middle line:84%
we're liberated from
all that self-judgment.

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's true,
because in your chart,

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:58.630 align:middle line:84%
which I've seen in your
book, and in my chart,

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:01.820 align:middle line:84%
we tend to live off of
the descending principles.

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And how often do people say,
oh, yeah, that's-- she's-- pew--

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.212 align:middle line:90%
she's out there.

00:36:07.212 --> 00:36:08.420 align:middle line:90%
You need to be more grounded.

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:09.650 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty far out.

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:11.150 align:middle line:90%
You know, she's out there.

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And in reality, that's
exactly true but for purpose.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:16.320 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:18.053 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's a--

00:36:18.053 --> 00:36:20.437 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: I found
my first reading

00:36:20.437 --> 00:36:22.770 align:middle line:84%
of my chart to just be one
of the most liberating things

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:23.570 align:middle line:90%
ever.

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:28.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like, not
only am I mostly galactic,

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.010 align:middle line:84%
but there's nothing
in my chart that

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:34.130 align:middle line:84%
indicates that I should feel
guilty because I wasn't a,

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:38.150 align:middle line:84%
you know, bra-burning
political activist in the '60s.

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: You know, and I
always felt guilty about that.

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.821 align:middle line:84%
I always felt like
I should have been

00:36:42.821 --> 00:36:46.860 align:middle line:84%
out there marching and
doing and-- but I never did.

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:47.680 align:middle line:90%
I never did it.

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:48.610 align:middle line:90%
I just always--

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:49.095 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You had a more--

00:36:49.095 --> 00:36:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: And I
judged myself for it.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of more of an
aloof cosmic view of things.

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:55.679 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and I felt
the same way, exactly.

00:36:55.679 --> 00:36:57.470 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't really one to
take to the streets.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:58.886 align:middle line:84%
But I was thinking
about all of it

00:36:58.886 --> 00:37:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and trying to put it
into a larger context

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:01.770 align:middle line:90%
through the years.

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:02.060 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Exactly.

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You know?

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Exactly.

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:06.576 align:middle line:84%
And so think about
this for a minute.

00:37:06.576 --> 00:37:11.140 align:middle line:84%
If you-- if you eliminate
all of those reasons

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:15.810 align:middle line:84%
that you have to judge
yourself, and if you eliminate

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:20.730 align:middle line:84%
all of those tendencies to
think up stuff to be afraid of,

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:23.860 align:middle line:84%
think of the amount of
energy that gets released.

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:26.993 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: You've got all of
this energy that you've been

00:37:26.993 --> 00:37:30.710 align:middle line:84%
spending on self-judgment and
negative stuff, and then--

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You know, I love this.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:32.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: And
then, you can-- you

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:38.267 align:middle line:84%
can start living your life
in a very different way.

00:37:38.267 --> 00:37:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so in truth-- in
the spirit of true confessions,

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:42.480 align:middle line:84%
one thing I've always
felt guilty about

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.630 align:middle line:84%
was very similar to what
you feel guilty about.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:48.170 align:middle line:84%
But it had to do during the
school years with my son.

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And that was, you had your
uber-moms who were there.

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:54.090 align:middle line:84%
And they were the ones that
volunteered for everything.

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And they got awards at
the end of the year.

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, there
was a lot of politics

00:37:57.850 --> 00:37:59.330 align:middle line:90%
involved in that little circle.

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:00.330 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't stand it.

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:01.871 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to go
anywhere near it.

00:38:01.871 --> 00:38:03.160 align:middle line:90%
I never volunteered.

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.400 align:middle line:84%
But when it was with
the kids, I volunteered.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:10.140 align:middle line:84%
As long as I was isolated with
the kids, to drive them places,

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:14.050 align:middle line:84%
take them on camping
trips, and carpool.

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was just me
and the kids, and we

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:19.492 align:middle line:84%
could talk about fun things
together and explore and play.

00:38:19.492 --> 00:38:20.700 align:middle line:90%
I was totally cool with that.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.870 align:middle line:84%
I just couldn't deal
with that burden

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:25.050 align:middle line:90%
of being with the parents.

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the mothers
didn't care for me.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:30.050 align:middle line:84%
I was that weird
"out there" mother.

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Those are the kinds of things
that we experience in life,

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:37.180 align:middle line:84%
that because we-- there
are so many should's.

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:38.665 align:middle line:90%
There are just so many should's.

00:38:38.665 --> 00:38:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:41.470 align:middle line:84%
So not everybody should be
volunteering all the time.

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:41.785 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: No.

00:38:41.785 --> 00:38:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:44.391 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: I mean, it's a
great thing for the people who

00:38:44.391 --> 00:38:45.470 align:middle line:90%
should be volunteering.

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:46.330 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: To volunteer.

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:48.163 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now, where
are the volunteers?

00:38:48.163 --> 00:38:50.825 align:middle line:84%
Are they containment, ascending,
containment, descending,

00:38:50.825 --> 00:38:53.040 align:middle line:84%
where are the ones
who are the grounded,

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.800 align:middle line:84%
earthy, they're going to come
in with a tray of cupcakes

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.910 align:middle line:90%
every Friday people.

00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Well, that's
a very different part

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:00.740 align:middle line:90%
of the body of information.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:02.705 align:middle line:84%
This body of
information is vast.

00:39:02.705 --> 00:39:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: I know this
show's only an hour,

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:06.720 align:middle line:84%
but we could talk for
a long time about it.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: You-- there
is also a consideration

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:18.070 align:middle line:84%
in your chart about where your
principles exist in your chart.

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:23.000 align:middle line:84%
There are four quadrants in
a circle, in a circle chart.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.260 align:middle line:84%
The first quadrant
is what we call

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:26.890 align:middle line:90%
the psychological quadrant.

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:28.620 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
lot of influence,

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:32.220 align:middle line:84%
a lot of your principles are
located in that first quadrant.

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Then, your job in the world--
part of your job in the world

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:43.040 align:middle line:84%
is sanity, maintaining a
healthy psychological beingness.

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Second quadrant is the
sociological quadrant.

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:49.500 align:middle line:84%
If you have a lot of
sociological energies,

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:51.020 align:middle line:90%
that's where the volunteers are.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.780 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
politicians are.

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.470 align:middle line:90%
That's where the actors are.

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:58.250 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
people who are really

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:01.280 align:middle line:90%
invested in healthy societies.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Third quadrant is
the quadrant of philosophy,

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.470 align:middle line:90%
the philosophical quadrant.

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:12.440 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a lot
of, uh, principles

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:14.460 align:middle line:84%
in the philosophical
quadrant, you

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:16.800 align:middle line:84%
are basically a
thinker, a philosopher,

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.035 align:middle line:84%
someone who asks
the right questions.

00:40:20.035 --> 00:40:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And do I have a
lot of stuff in that one?

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:22.680 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yes, you do.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I bet.

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yes, you do.

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:27.020 align:middle line:84%
That's why we said the
other day on the phone,

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.370 align:middle line:84%
I said, asking the
right questions

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:31.670 align:middle line:84%
in the right way with
the right vocabulary

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:33.780 align:middle line:90%
is what gets the right answers.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:37.300 align:middle line:84%
That's why you ask
questions, because you know

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:40.280 align:middle line:90%
how to bring answers forth.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:44.280 align:middle line:84%
It's back to what I was saying
earlier about your principles.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.870 align:middle line:84%
You don't ever ask
yourself, how do I use

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:49.550 align:middle line:90%
my principle of intelligence.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:52.310 align:middle line:84%
The right question is how
do I get out of the way

00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:56.700 align:middle line:84%
so that intelligence can express
in this circumstance, right.

00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:00.360 align:middle line:84%
It's the same question, but
if it's asked correctly,

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.500 align:middle line:90%
the answer is right there.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.439 align:middle line:90%
You just do it.

00:41:02.439 --> 00:41:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You just do it.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: You just sit back.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so--

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: And do it.

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's
the fourth quadrant?

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: The
spiritual quadrant.

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:08.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: So people who
are heavily, you know,

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:14.000 align:middle line:84%
invested in the
spiritual quadrant are

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.340 align:middle line:84%
spiritual practitioners and
need to be given the freedom

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:20.990 align:middle line:90%
to be spiritual practitioners.

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about some of the words

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.960 align:middle line:84%
in the ascending,
the containment,

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:29.420 align:middle line:84%
and descending, because this
is-- in ancient traditions,

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:32.610 align:middle line:84%
as well, the power of
words is really important.

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And we have completely
run roughshod over it.

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:38.360 align:middle line:84%
I know they add new words
to the Webster's and Oxford

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.440 align:middle line:84%
dictionaries all
the time, that are

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:45.055 align:middle line:84%
kind of right out of "Brave
New World" and "Animal Farm,"

00:41:45.055 --> 00:41:46.070 align:middle line:90%
Newspeak.

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah.

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which, that's fine.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.860 align:middle line:84%
It's just a new
means of expression,

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.620 align:middle line:90%
and language should evolve.

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:55.070 align:middle line:84%
But there are
classical words that

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:59.040 align:middle line:84%
have power, substance,
and beauty that are seldom

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.870 align:middle line:90%
used in our vocabulary anymore.

00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And I-- Now, I would
skew a little bit

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:06.580 align:middle line:84%
toward the conspiratorial end
on that and say, interesting,

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:09.250 align:middle line:84%
these words aren't the words
that are dominant any longer.

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Yet while in ancient
times, for example,

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:16.550 align:middle line:84%
in ancient Grecian times
when philosophy ruled,

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:20.290 align:middle line:84%
these words were prominent
in the vocabulary.

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:21.999 align:middle line:84%
Something's been lost
that's significant.

00:42:21.999 --> 00:42:22.798 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Right.

00:42:22.798 --> 00:42:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your system
has brought them back.

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Yes, these--
all of the words

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:32.010 align:middle line:84%
have very specific definitions,
which are slightly different.

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:34.660 align:middle line:84%
For example, one
of the principles

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:40.780 align:middle line:84%
that it's the ascending category
is the principle of generosity.

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which, the earth
itself, that makes sense.

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Exactly.

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, the principle
of generosity doesn't

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.790 align:middle line:84%
mean you should run around
giving people stuff.

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:54.920 align:middle line:84%
If you have the principle of
generosity in your garment,

00:42:54.920 --> 00:43:02.470 align:middle line:84%
the imperative of generosity
is the correct balance

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:05.060 align:middle line:90%
between giving and receiving.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:06.640 align:middle line:90%
That's the imperative.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:11.920 align:middle line:84%
So people who are
generous, but don't

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:16.190 align:middle line:84%
allow themselves to receive,
are not really generous.

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:19.070 align:middle line:90%
They're just buying.

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:22.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're
buying your friendship.

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:23.260 align:middle line:90%
They're buying favors.

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.854 align:middle line:84%
They're buying
attention or whatever.

00:43:24.854 --> 00:43:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, there's
usually some kind of factor,

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.970 align:middle line:84%
subconscious factor under there
that's causing that depletion.

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Right, so
that's one of the things

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:37.650 align:middle line:84%
that I say to people who have
generosity in their contract

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:39.940 align:middle line:90%
or in their pattern.

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:43.170 align:middle line:90%
Do you get as much as you give?

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:45.550 align:middle line:90%
And almost everybody says no.

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And I say, OK, is that
a perception problem

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:51.990 align:middle line:90%
or is that a real problem.

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:54.060 align:middle line:84%
If it's a perception
problem, it's

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:57.754 align:middle line:84%
because you think
you always the one

00:43:57.754 --> 00:43:59.920 align:middle line:84%
that's always taking care
of everybody and whatever.

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.550 align:middle line:90%
If it's a real problem, why?

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Why are you not
allowing generosity

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:08.830 align:middle line:90%
to tell you when to express?

00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Why are you willfully
doling out whatever it is,

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.610 align:middle line:84%
energy, time, money,
whatever, you know.

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:16.770 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
I'm talking about.

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:19.020 align:middle line:84%
It's not the soul
that needed to learn

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:20.750 align:middle line:90%
the definition of generosity.

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:23.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the personality that
needs to get out of the way

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:25.681 align:middle line:84%
and let generosity
express through.

00:44:25.681 --> 00:44:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that
shows up oftentimes

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:29.817 align:middle line:84%
as sort of a super
slave syndrome.

00:44:29.817 --> 00:44:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Yes, yes,
well, now, there's

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:37.630 align:middle line:84%
another principle that is in
the containing definition that

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:39.590 align:middle line:90%
is called service.

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And I really get that
a lot with women who

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:46.350 align:middle line:90%
have service in their patterns.

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:49.610 align:middle line:84%
They're like, oh, no, I don't
want to be a servant anymore.

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:51.630 align:middle line:90%
That's all I do is be a servant.

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:56.920 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no, no, no, service
is not about being a doormat.

00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:02.310 align:middle line:84%
It's about recognizing
that life is a gift.

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And that you are
the gift to life.

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:08.400 align:middle line:84%
So you're not
serving other people.

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.870 align:middle line:84%
You're serving life
by being alive.

00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:15.140 align:middle line:84%
It's really a very
high principle.

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:20.800 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, because of
the way we use the word,

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:23.470 align:middle line:84%
it does turn out to
sometimes scare people,

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:26.406 align:middle line:84%
meaning that they think
that what I'm saying

00:45:26.406 --> 00:45:28.030 align:middle line:84%
is they are supposed
to run around just

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:28.354 align:middle line:90%
taking care of people.

00:45:28.354 --> 00:45:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Living a
life of servitude.

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:29.940 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah.

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:31.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Exactly.

00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I mean,
again, that's what I really

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:36.790 align:middle line:84%
like about this is the
very specific way in which

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:40.120 align:middle line:90%
these words are presented.

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.770 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
a couple more words

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:43.750 align:middle line:84%
in the ascending
patterns that are common.

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And then, I want
to talk about what

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.790 align:middle line:84%
happens in various
cultures, if you read people

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:48.800 align:middle line:90%
from different cultures.

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.950 align:middle line:84%
But first, a few ascending
words, a few containing words,

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:53.134 align:middle line:90%
a few descending words.

00:45:53.134 --> 00:45:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: OK, one of
the ascending words

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.530 align:middle line:84%
that scares people
to death is memory,

00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:59.520 align:middle line:90%
the principle of memory.

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:03.040 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how many times,
when I say to someone, OK,

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.900 align:middle line:84%
one of your main
principles is memory.

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:06.277 align:middle line:84%
Oh, no, I have a
terrible memory.

00:46:06.277 --> 00:46:07.360 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember anything.

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, oh, oh.

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Oh, no, I'm
really bad at memory.

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:10.540 align:middle line:90%
This is terrible.

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.406 align:middle line:90%
I'm a failure at my own--

00:46:12.406 --> 00:46:13.206 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Garment.

00:46:13.206 --> 00:46:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Beingness, yeah.

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:19.220 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no, no, no,
memory is that moment

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:24.240 align:middle line:84%
in the development
of the universe where

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:29.020 align:middle line:84%
a cell remembered how to
recreate itself exactly.

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:31.979 align:middle line:84%
That level of memory
is beyond anything

00:46:31.979 --> 00:46:33.270 align:middle line:90%
that goes on in the head brain.

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's an
inherent kind of memory.

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Yes, it's
a very, very deep

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and profound level of
consciousness about what life

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:46.440 align:middle line:84%
is, about how life knows how
to reconstruct and reproduce

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.020 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:55.842 align:middle line:84%
Memory, the principle, is
focused in the mineral kingdom.

00:46:55.842 --> 00:46:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to say,
an ascending principle coming

00:46:58.300 --> 00:46:59.170 align:middle line:90%
from the earth.

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:01.086 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: It's focused
in the mineral kingdom.

00:47:01.086 --> 00:47:03.830 align:middle line:84%
In your body, it's
focused in the bones.

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:07.510 align:middle line:84%
When anthropologists
find a bone,

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:09.370 align:middle line:84%
they are very, very
excited because they

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:13.670 align:middle line:84%
can tell a lot about
that being's lifetime.

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:14.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:15.886 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: By just
one little piece

00:47:15.886 --> 00:47:17.860 align:middle line:84%
of a bone because all
of that information

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:21.620 align:middle line:84%
was downloaded into the bones,
just like the earth downloads

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:23.410 align:middle line:90%
her information into the stones.

00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:25.692 align:middle line:90%
So memory is another one.

00:47:25.692 --> 00:47:27.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: More kind
of DNA-related.

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yes, yes.

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:31.422 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, and another one.

00:47:31.422 --> 00:47:32.880 align:middle line:84%
Because we can't
go through all 30,

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.671 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't have time
to go through all 30.

00:47:34.671 --> 00:47:36.980 align:middle line:84%
But I want to give people a
feeling for the principles

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and why these words are
with each of these three

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:41.210 align:middle line:90%
groupings of principles.

00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:42.190 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Right.

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:44.180 align:middle line:84%
There's another
one, purity, it's

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:47.080 align:middle line:90%
another ascending principle.

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, purity to some
people means, you know--

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:52.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Chastity.

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Chastity.

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:53.708 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or something.

00:47:53.708 --> 00:47:56.185 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Right, just like
it, being really nice.

00:47:56.185 --> 00:47:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Purity, as
a spiritual principle,

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:07.180 align:middle line:84%
has to do with being able to
recognize original intention.

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:11.360 align:middle line:84%
So when I say to
somebody, you have purity,

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:14.830 align:middle line:84%
I will often say to them,
when you look at a rose,

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:16.820 align:middle line:90%
you're looking at a flower.

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:19.100 align:middle line:84%
But you're also
looking at roseness.

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:22.640 align:middle line:84%
You're also looking
at flowerness.

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:25.510 align:middle line:84%
You're also looking
at plantness.

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:28.410 align:middle line:90%
You're also looking at seedness.

00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:30.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can
see all the way back

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:36.350 align:middle line:84%
to the original intention,
the seed idea of something.

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:41.450 align:middle line:84%
So when someone is, who has
purity, is in your presence,

00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:44.170 align:middle line:84%
they can overlook all
of the flaws that have

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:45.505 align:middle line:90%
happened between original idea.

00:48:45.505 --> 00:48:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And see the
essence of who you are.

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: And see
the essence of it.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.255 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Whether
it's who you are--

00:48:50.255 --> 00:48:51.065 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or what it is.

00:48:51.065 --> 00:48:52.156 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: The idea or whatever.

00:48:52.156 --> 00:48:53.072 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The essence.

00:48:53.072 --> 00:48:55.594 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: And these
people help clarify.

00:48:55.594 --> 00:48:56.885 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's beautiful.

00:48:56.885 --> 00:48:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: They're like the
liver of an organization, right.

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.750 align:middle line:84%
They help clarify and take it
back to the original intent.

00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: So those are
three ascending principles.

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where's innocence?

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Innocence is also
an ascending principle.

00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:10.061 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I was
wondering because sometimes

00:49:10.061 --> 00:49:12.280 align:middle line:84%
that's a-- people in our
common vernacular align

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.080 align:middle line:90%
that with purity.

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Yes, and
innocence and purity

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:17.560 align:middle line:84%
sit right next to
each other on this.

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:21.660 align:middle line:84%
But innocence, now, as
a spiritual principle

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:27.230 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to be taught,
teachability, teachingness.

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:29.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like
you can always--

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.440 align:middle line:84%
like a child plays
with a toy and then

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.040 align:middle line:84%
you hide the toy
behind your back,

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:38.059 align:middle line:84%
and the child thinks the toy
has completely disappeared.

00:49:38.059 --> 00:49:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And then, you bring
the toy back out,

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:42.260 align:middle line:84%
and it's like he's never
seen the toy before, right.

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, innocence-- people
with innocence in their chart

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:50.410 align:middle line:84%
somewhere have that ability
to greet every circumstance

00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:52.470 align:middle line:84%
as if they'd never
been there before.

00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:53.990 align:middle line:84%
They don't live
in the been there,

00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:58.870 align:middle line:84%
done that kind of cynicism
that I live in so--

00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I live more like that.

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:01.214 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:50:01.214 --> 00:50:02.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, like it's new.

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:06.720 align:middle line:84%
The downside of that is, if
something doesn't feel good,

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.592 align:middle line:90%
that's it.

00:50:07.592 --> 00:50:08.482 align:middle line:90%
That's life now.

00:50:08.482 --> 00:50:09.690 align:middle line:90%
That's going to last forever.

00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:11.380 align:middle line:84%
When it's going to
pass by the next day.

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Right.

00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the same
thing if it's good.

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:15.960 align:middle line:84%
So maybe I've got that
somewhere in there.

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:16.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Somewhere,
probably you do.

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Anyway, so go ahead.

00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:19.850 align:middle line:90%
So that's--

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: All right.

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So a couple-- let's see,
a couple of the containing

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:23.550 align:middle line:90%
principles.

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of them
is reciprocity.

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:32.710 align:middle line:84%
So reciprocity is a
little bit like generosity

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:37.360 align:middle line:84%
in that it has to do with that
kind of infinity sign, you

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:40.420 align:middle line:84%
know, what comes
around goes around.

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:43.659 align:middle line:84%
So without getting into the
blame the victim mentality,

00:50:43.659 --> 00:50:45.450 align:middle line:84%
you know, if something
bad happened to you,

00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:46.470 align:middle line:90%
it's because you deserve it.

00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:48.533 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: That's not
what I'm talking about.

00:50:48.533 --> 00:50:52.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm just talking about the whole
idea of kind of pay it forward

00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:54.580 align:middle line:90%
and then it comes back to you.

00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And you can watch that
often more clearly

00:50:57.970 --> 00:51:00.990 align:middle line:84%
outside of yourself
than in yourself

00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:03.720 align:middle line:84%
because when you're watching
reciprocity inside yourself,

00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:07.100 align:middle line:84%
you tend to get blame me
and guilty, and you know,

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:07.900 align:middle line:90%
I did something.

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this is more
to understand, like you say,

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.200 align:middle line:84%
that infinite flow of energy
in life, back and forth.

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.000 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yes, yes.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.958 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What goes out,
eventually comes back.

00:51:15.958 --> 00:51:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Yes, and so you have
kind of that witness ability

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:23.840 align:middle line:84%
to watch how that-- how
that works and go, huh, wow,

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.200 align:middle line:90%
that's cool, right.

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:27.365 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:51:27.365 --> 00:51:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Let's see, what's
another containing principle?

00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, intelligence is one of
the containing principles.

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:37.780 align:middle line:84%
So again, most people
will say, you know--

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:38.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: IQ.

00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:40.871 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah, it's about
your-- it's about your brain

00:51:40.871 --> 00:51:41.770 align:middle line:90%
smarts.

00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:43.570 align:middle line:84%
But the principle
of intelligence

00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:47.010 align:middle line:84%
is really about
sharing information.

00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:50.000 align:middle line:84%
It's about the distribution
of information.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.300 align:middle line:84%
It's like the central nervous
system of the cosmic body.

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So intelligence takes in
information without judging it

00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:00.960 align:middle line:90%
and shares it freely.

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's something
that's really interesting.

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:09.250 align:middle line:84%
If you-- if you give the
United States of America, July

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:12.960 align:middle line:84%
the 4th, 1776,
birthday, the sun,

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.770 align:middle line:84%
the primary principle of
the United States of America

00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:20.920 align:middle line:84%
is intelligence, the
free flow of information.

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's what almost
anybody who ever comes here

00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:26.950 align:middle line:90%
from another country will say.

00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:28.660 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
information here.

00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:31.122 align:middle line:90%
You can find out everything.

00:52:31.122 --> 00:52:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, that's true.

00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: And we're in
such an interesting time

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:40.710 align:middle line:84%
right now where we're looking
at free flow of information.

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:43.150 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at, should
we know everything

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:45.040 align:middle line:84%
that the government
is doing and saying.

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And should we know
all of these secrets?

00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:50.350 align:middle line:90%
Is that our right?

00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:52.290 align:middle line:90%
Because that is our birthmark.

00:52:52.290 --> 00:52:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Or you know, and the difference
between the free flow

00:52:56.610 --> 00:52:59.010 align:middle line:84%
of information and
security in your own home.

00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, the
country is actually

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.659 align:middle line:84%
having that
conversation right now.

00:53:02.659 --> 00:53:03.533 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:53:03.533 --> 00:53:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: As if we're-- as
if we're in some kind of real

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.090 align:middle line:90%
interesting rebirth process.

00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very interesting.

00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:13.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's talk about some of
the descending principles now.

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: All right.

00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Words.

00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: There's a descending
principle called randomness,

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:22.800 align:middle line:84%
scares the bejesus out
of people because it

00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:29.800 align:middle line:84%
seems so wacky to say, oh,
look, your primary principle is

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:30.900 align:middle line:90%
randomness.

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:32.136 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no, no, no.

00:53:32.136 --> 00:53:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I
have no bearings.

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yes, yes.

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: But as a
spiritual principle,

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:43.670 align:middle line:84%
it's defined as that ability
to consider all possibilities

00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and then allow the one that
needs to be expressed freedom

00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:50.010 align:middle line:90%
to come forward.

00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:54.287 align:middle line:84%
So the analogy I use
is like a kaleidoscope.

00:53:54.287 --> 00:53:55.870 align:middle line:84%
You're looking through
a kaleidoscope.

00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:56.920 align:middle line:90%
You see a pattern.

00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:57.720 align:middle line:90%
You twist it.

00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:00.300 align:middle line:84%
All of those rocks go
chinka chinka chinka.

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:03.540 align:middle line:84%
You know it's all
the same rocks.

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:04.940 align:middle line:90%
It strikes another pattern.

00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:06.681 align:middle line:84%
It can't possibly be
all the same rocks

00:54:06.681 --> 00:54:08.180 align:middle line:84%
because the pattern
is so different.

00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:08.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: But that
chinka chinka chinka part

00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:13.955 align:middle line:84%
is where you live
if randomness is

00:54:13.955 --> 00:54:17.515 align:middle line:84%
part of your-- part
of your practice, part

00:54:17.515 --> 00:54:19.550 align:middle line:90%
of your influence.

00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to learn how
to-- you can't be a control

00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:25.977 align:middle line:84%
freak if randomness
is a part of your--

00:54:25.977 --> 00:54:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:28.185 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: --of your system.

00:54:28.185 --> 00:54:33.044 align:middle line:84%
You have to be willing for all
possibilities to come through.

00:54:33.044 --> 00:54:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you
a quick example.

00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:39.790 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine's daughter, I
think it's her son's principle,

00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:42.000 align:middle line:90%
randomness.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, she had a heck of a
time deciding what college she

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:49.320 align:middle line:90%
wanted to go to.

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:52.550 align:middle line:84%
She-- or even what college
she wanted to apply to.

00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And she needed to
see all of them.

00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of those--
they live in California,

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and now, they've
got to go to Boston.

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.486 align:middle line:84%
And now, they've got to go,
you know-- it was, like,

00:55:00.486 --> 00:55:04.380 align:middle line:84%
expensive and crazy-making,
because she could not

00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:05.940 align:middle line:90%
make a choice.

00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:10.130 align:middle line:84%
But the mother knew
her principles.

00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And the mother knew
randomness was her principle.

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
way it had to be.

00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she had to see
it all, considerate it all

00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:17.030 align:middle line:90%
and let it shake down.

00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.830 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Right.

00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you didn't know
that about your child,

00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:22.310 align:middle line:90%
you might get frustrated and--

00:55:22.310 --> 00:55:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or just say,
no, we're not doing that.

00:55:24.310 --> 00:55:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah.

00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah,
make up your mind.

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:26.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: So this is one of
the advantages of knowing

00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:30.940 align:middle line:90%
your children's principles--

00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: --is being able to
create an environment that

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.660 align:middle line:90%
allows them to express.

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, it
is parental structures

00:55:42.370 --> 00:55:45.270 align:middle line:84%
that make us block a lot
of our authentic selves.

00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:48.255 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: All right,
so that's randomness.

00:55:48.255 --> 00:55:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We already
talked about dreaming so--

00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:52.051 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: We already
talked about dreaming.

00:55:52.051 --> 00:55:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So another one is desire,
the principle of desire.

00:55:56.500 --> 00:56:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you have
desire in your pattern,

00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:05.070 align:middle line:84%
and you haven't really
learned how to let it express,

00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:08.940 align:middle line:84%
it's probably going to
show up as acquisitional.

00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:11.110 align:middle line:84%
I like this, and I want
this, and I want that.

00:56:11.110 --> 00:56:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And if I get this, my
life will be better.

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.947 align:middle line:84%
If I get that job, my
life will be better.

00:56:15.947 --> 00:56:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've got that job so I need
to have these clothes to wear

00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:19.040 align:middle line:90%
to that job.

00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And then, my life
will be better.

00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And now, I want that
house because then,

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:23.060 align:middle line:90%
my life will be better.

00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And everybody with
an ounce of sense

00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:29.540 align:middle line:84%
knows that there is
no amount of stuff

00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:31.890 align:middle line:84%
you can own that's going
to make your life better.

00:56:31.890 --> 00:56:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:32.300 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: It's not.

00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that does
afflict people, maybe more that

00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:37.010 align:middle line:84%
have a guiding
principle of desire

00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:38.987 align:middle line:84%
in their chart in
the sun, right.

00:56:38.987 --> 00:56:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yes, until you--

00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: If it's--

00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:41.826 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Until,
until you finally

00:56:41.826 --> 00:56:47.500 align:middle line:84%
realize that that longing
is longing for the soul,

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.840 align:middle line:84%
is longing for that deep
connection with the soul.

00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:51.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a longing to go home.

00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:54.280 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes
your life better.

00:56:54.280 --> 00:57:01.575 align:middle line:84%
So when desire really matures
and manifests through someone,

00:57:01.575 --> 00:57:03.162 align:middle line:90%
they tend to be minimalists.

00:57:03.162 --> 00:57:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hm mm.

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:07.251 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Because it's not
about acquisition at all.

00:57:07.251 --> 00:57:08.167 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:57:08.167 --> 00:57:09.480 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: So, yeah.

00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now,
let's talk about what

00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:14.050 align:middle line:84%
happens when you read people
from various cultures.

00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Do you find culturally
certain words

00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:19.920 align:middle line:84%
might be more dominant
in some countries

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:23.350 align:middle line:84%
or some cultural
backgrounds than others?

00:57:23.350 --> 00:57:24.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm just curious about that.

00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: You know, that
is kind of a challenge.

00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't worked a lot
with non-Western cultures.

00:57:29.770 --> 00:57:30.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:57:30.570 --> 00:57:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: You know, so when
I'm speaking with someone from

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:35.050 align:middle line:90%
Europe--

00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:36.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Or even someone
from South America,

00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:43.030 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't tend to be a problem.

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Chinese people,
most Asian people,

00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Indian people who operate
from different astrological

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:52.350 align:middle line:90%
systems--

00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
the Vedic system.

00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:53.845 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Like the Vedic system.

00:57:53.845 --> 00:57:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That doesn't
plug into this the same.

00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Well, you know,
they just didn't tell me.

00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:59.830 align:middle line:84%
The angels haven't instructed
me about working with--

00:57:59.830 --> 00:58:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You didn't get
downloaded the Vedic version.

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:01.900 align:middle line:90%
OK, gotcha.

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:02.983 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: So I don't know.

00:58:02.983 --> 00:58:07.980 align:middle line:84%
But I would say, my willful
part of myself would say,

00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:10.470 align:middle line:84%
if you're born in India,
then I would probably

00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:13.367 align:middle line:84%
do a Vedic chart on you, rather
than a Western chart on you.

00:58:13.367 --> 00:58:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, and see--

00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: It kind of
matters where you're born.

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: So I don't know
if I'm really qualified

00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:19.410 align:middle line:90%
to answer that question.

00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's OK.

00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:22.050 align:middle line:84%
That was just something
that occurred to me to ask.

00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:22.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Yeah.

00:58:22.850 --> 00:58:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is your primary
principle that shows itself,

00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:27.800 align:middle line:84%
that would have you
sitting here doing this

00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:30.420 align:middle line:84%
and bringing this
information through?

00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: My primary principle
is the principle of humility,

00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:34.380 align:middle line:90%
challenging.

00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
talk about humility.

00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:58:36.790 --> 00:58:37.230 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about it.

00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:38.825 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: You noticed I
skipped right over humility.

00:58:38.825 --> 00:58:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you did.

00:58:39.570 --> 00:58:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Humility is one of
the descending principles.

00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: And the
definition of humility, it

00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:47.410 align:middle line:84%
sort of falls in that
service thing, you know.

00:58:47.410 --> 00:58:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Most people think of
humility as being,

00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:52.820 align:middle line:90%
like, the doormat syndrome.

00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:54.420 align:middle line:90%
You've got to be quiet.

00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:58.240 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be,
you know-- the way

00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:02.920 align:middle line:84%
the angels defined humility
is they said it is equally as

00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:05.710 align:middle line:84%
arrogant to think too
little of yourself

00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:08.680 align:middle line:84%
as it is to think
too much of yourself.

00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:12.390 align:middle line:84%
So if humility is in
your chart, your job

00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:19.590 align:middle line:84%
is to be authentic-- an
authentic knower of yourself.

00:59:19.590 --> 00:59:22.260 align:middle line:90%
That has been my job.

00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:25.320 align:middle line:84%
That is why I'm not
much of a self-promoter

00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:28.870 align:middle line:84%
because I have to
spend a lot of time

00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:33.390 align:middle line:84%
making sure I'm not
inflated or deflated.

00:59:33.390 --> 00:59:38.160 align:middle line:84%
I am only available
for my principles

00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:41.970 align:middle line:84%
to express through me when I
am in my most authentic knowing

00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:43.710 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:49.330 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, before we wrap it up,
you-- people can access you.

00:59:49.330 --> 00:59:51.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they haven't
been able to find you

00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:52.530 align:middle line:84%
because you just don't
put yourself out there.

00:59:52.530 --> 00:59:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
coming out, by the way,

00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:56.790 align:middle line:90%
and it is beautiful work.

00:59:56.790 --> 00:59:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And they can find you
and interface with you

00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:02.070 align:middle line:84%
directly because
you actually work

01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:04.150 align:middle line:84%
on a kind of one-to-one
basis with people?

01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: I do, I do.

01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:08.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm teaching a few
online classes right now

01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:11.260 align:middle line:90%
with small groups of people.

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:13.770 align:middle line:84%
For the most part,
I work one-on-one.

01:00:13.770 --> 01:00:17.560 align:middle line:84%
My website is
www.turtledreamers.com.

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:20.924 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: The animal
turtle, dreamers, dot com.

01:00:20.924 --> 01:00:25.943 align:middle line:84%
And there are all kinds of
ways to get in touch with me

01:00:25.943 --> 01:00:26.743 align:middle line:90%
through that.

01:00:26.743 --> 01:00:28.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
you have a workbook.

01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: In addition to
"The Invisible Garment"--

01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:31.705 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe I didn't bring
a copy of the book out to show

01:00:31.705 --> 01:00:31.726 align:middle line:90%
you.

01:00:31.726 --> 01:00:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I have a copy of it.

01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:34.060 align:middle line:84%
I just left it in the
make-up room over there.

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: I know, me, too.

01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But that's OK.

01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:35.680 align:middle line:90%
Everybody--

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: There are two
copies in the make-up room.

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.248 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everybody
can see it right now.

01:00:38.248 --> 01:00:40.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not a problem.

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:44.890 align:middle line:84%
"The Invisible Garment"
workbook is a book

01:00:44.890 --> 01:00:47.960 align:middle line:90%
that I construct for you.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:51.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you order a workbook, you
send me your birth information.

01:00:51.970 --> 01:00:57.220 align:middle line:84%
I construct this large--
it's about 150 pages--

01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:00.210 align:middle line:84%
workbook that is specific
to your principles

01:01:00.210 --> 01:01:05.600 align:middle line:84%
and your positions on the chart
and all of that kind of thing.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:09.350 align:middle line:84%
So that's one way to get more
deeply involved in the work.

01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: The workbook
has tons more information

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:14.020 align:middle line:90%
in it than the book does.

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:18.040 align:middle line:84%
The book was basically the
definitions of the principles.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:21.006 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: So the workbook
has tons more information.

01:01:21.006 --> 01:01:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And then, occasionally,
I will do a seminar

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:27.910 align:middle line:84%
or teach a class where we
go through the workbook

01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:29.830 align:middle line:90%
in small groups.

01:01:29.830 --> 01:01:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
people, who've

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:34.760 align:middle line:84%
studied with me for a real long
time around the country, who

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.999 align:middle line:90%
do also teach classes.

01:01:35.999 --> 01:01:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
you can certainly

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:39.540 align:middle line:84%
see the value in
knowing this, especially

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.610 align:middle line:84%
among the people that
are closest to you,

01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:43.320 align:middle line:84%
so you can understand
each other better.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And the thing-- the
thing of beauty in this

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:47.870 align:middle line:84%
is there's no
making anyone wrong.

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Oh, right.

01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These are all useful,
positive, inspirational,

01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:56.100 align:middle line:84%
uplifting traits of
humanity that each of us

01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:57.640 align:middle line:90%
possess in our own spectrum.

01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.265 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: Yes, you're
absolutely right.

01:01:59.265 --> 01:02:02.234 align:middle line:10%
And it is so helpful, like
I gave you the example

01:02:02.234 --> 01:02:03.525 align:middle line:10%
of the mother and the daughter.

01:02:03.525 --> 01:02:03.890 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:06.120 align:middle line:10%
>>KAPLAN: It's also
helpful between spouses.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:06.330 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:02:06.330 --> 01:02:07.800 align:middle line:10%
>>KAPLAN: Because
spouses often tend

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.030 align:middle line:10%
to try to make each other
wrong, just because they do.

01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:10.570 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: They think.

01:02:10.570 --> 01:02:11.190 align:middle line:10%
>>KAPLAN: You know.

01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tried that.

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KAPLAN: You know, so if your
husband's-- if your husband's

01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:18.610 align:middle line:84%
mental body is in randomness
and yours is in focus,

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:21.430 align:middle line:84%
the two of you think
very differently.

01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And so if you don't
understand that, you can--

01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It may be a good
idea to get a chart done

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:28.220 align:middle line:90%
before you get married, huh.

01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:30.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:02:30.550 --> 01:02:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Connie, thank you so
much for your time.

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:32.605 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Oh, my pleasure.

01:02:32.605 --> 01:02:34.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And thank you for
coming out of the closet

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and sharing this after
being quiet for so long.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:37.587 align:middle line:90%
It's very beautiful.

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>>KAPLAN: Thank you.

01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:40.628 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To learn more
about your invisible garment,

01:02:40.628 --> 01:02:43.702 align:middle line:84%
you can go to Connie's
website at turtledreamers.com.

01:02:43.702 --> 01:02:45.790 align:middle line:10%
And the workbook we
just talked about,

01:02:45.790 --> 01:02:48.560 align:middle line:10%
that will guide you through
your own garment pattern.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:50.520 align:middle line:84%
You can also pick up
her original work,

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.542 align:middle line:84%
"The Invisible
Garment," at amazon.com

01:02:52.542 --> 01:02:54.210 align:middle line:90%

01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
