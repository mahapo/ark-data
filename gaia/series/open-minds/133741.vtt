00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.970 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: I
don't know about you,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.990 align:middle line:10%
but I live my life to music.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.160 align:middle line:10%
When I wake up, I want to
hear one type of music.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.320 align:middle line:10%
As the day starts ramping up
in activity, I want another.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And in those times of
great changes in life,

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.720 align:middle line:84%
I need an epic piece
to signal a new era.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.220 align:middle line:90%
Why is this so important?

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.390 align:middle line:10%
Well, let's talk to Barry
Goldstein, the author

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.040 align:middle line:10%
of "Secret Language
of the Heart,"

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.560 align:middle line:10%
which is music, the secret
language of the heart.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BARRY GOLDSTEIN: Absolutely.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you know,
I find it such a-- that's

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.080 align:middle line:90%
how my day begins.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:84%
I make a cup of
tea, and then start

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.010 align:middle line:84%
searching for the perfect
music for that day.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I can go through
and think, oh, maybe

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.380 align:middle line:90%
a little Vivaldi, but no.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.180 align:middle line:90%
Mm-mm.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.459 align:middle line:90%
That's not working for me.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Go to something soft and
a little more emotional.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.530 align:middle line:90%
That's not it either.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'll go through
a lot of choices

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.270 align:middle line:84%
until I find the thing that's
right for-- a right match

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.950 align:middle line:84%
emotionally and
mentally for that moment

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.230 align:middle line:90%
and what I need to do.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: That's amazing.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.860 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is that what you do?

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: It is.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.610 align:middle line:10%
I think that's a starting
point with the secret language

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:10%
of the heart is
really asking yourself

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.490 align:middle line:10%
where you are in that moment,
where do you want to go,

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.730 align:middle line:10%
and what piece of music is
going to take you there,

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.140 align:middle line:10%
because music's a bridge.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.130 align:middle line:84%
It's like your
magic carpet ride.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And I have such deep
appreciation for it.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And first of all,
so do other people.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was just looking at
the endorsements on your book.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.560 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK,
well, I think I've

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:84%
interviewed all those-- Gregg
Braden, Don Miguel Ruiz--

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.900 align:middle line:84%
many, many, many other
people that I would

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.850 align:middle line:90%
have interviewed in this arena.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
Joe Dispenza.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.670 align:middle line:84%
What is it about
what you're doing

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.830 align:middle line:84%
that has such wide support from
the community of people who

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.190 align:middle line:84%
are considered, you know,
conscious media of one

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:90%
kind or another?

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Well, I think it
has to do with my intention

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.480 align:middle line:90%
and what I put into the music.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And really, for me, it's
a complex system, music.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not as simple
as it always sounds.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: So putting emotion
and intention and composition

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.290 align:middle line:84%
and harmonics and creating a
recipe that is unique to each

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.360 align:middle line:90%
one of those authors--

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: --to support
their vision and what they

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.460 align:middle line:90%
want to share with the world.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately, I think
what the attraction

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.770 align:middle line:84%
has been that I have an
understanding of what it takes

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.020 align:middle line:84%
to bring people into their
hearts, because I've gone

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.090 align:middle line:90%
and taken that journey myself.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And also to encourage
people to live

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.630 align:middle line:84%
their heart and their passion
and how music can be a vehicle

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.430 align:middle line:90%
to take them there.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a serious thing.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.800 align:middle line:90%
It's a fun thing.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.550 align:middle line:84%
But we all want
to have something

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.260 align:middle line:90%
that supports our vision.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it all comes down
to, basically, energy medicine.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: It is.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.599 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Absolutely.

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.310 align:middle line:90%
Music is a carrier of that.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.990 align:middle line:90%
Music creates its own field.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:18.730 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.370 align:middle line:84%
So now one of the people
you work very closely with

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.760 align:middle line:84%
is Dr. Joe Dispenza, whom
I've interviewed a few times.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: I do.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.643 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We love Dr. Joe.

00:03:25.643 --> 00:03:28.090 align:middle line:90%
Everybody loves Dr. Joe.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And talk to us a little bit
about the more sciencey end

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.290 align:middle line:90%
of what you do together.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Well, we
definitely are targeting

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.160 align:middle line:90%
specific states of being.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.490 align:middle line:84%
So we know for a fact that
when the human body is

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.480 align:middle line:84%
in a more coherent state, and
a lot of times that means more

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.730 align:middle line:84%
smooth, orderly heart rhythms
that benefit our physical body,

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:84%
then the body does
what it does best.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And that is heal or move to
that parasympathetic state.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.180 align:middle line:84%
So when we're working
together, this all kind of

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.000 align:middle line:84%
goes into the recipe of bringing
people to those coherent heart

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.040 align:middle line:90%
states.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And when we're doing that, we're
also working with brain states

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:09.770 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.760 align:middle line:84%
So we're targeting specific
brain states-- alpha, theta--

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.829 align:middle line:84%
based on what is
going on in the group.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
we're doing it live,

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:84%
and we're doing
it in the moment.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.560 align:middle line:84%
So we're also
basing it on what's

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.660 align:middle line:90%
going on in the audience.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.010 align:middle line:84%
We're feeling the
audience's energy.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Joe was conducting
it and orchestrating it,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.500 align:middle line:84%
and we had this back
and forth, where

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.120 align:middle line:84%
the audience becomes an integral
part of the composition.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you've
even gone as far

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.910 align:middle line:84%
as working with
technology interfaces that

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.490 align:middle line:84%
are reading the field or reading
your EEG, EKG, and so forth.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little bit about
that and what you and Dr. Joe

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.470 align:middle line:90%
found.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Well, we found
that in these meditations,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.300 align:middle line:84%
people are moving to those
coherent brain wave states

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.990 align:middle line:90%
in very short periods of time.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.615 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're witnessing
it via the technology involved.

00:05:02.615 --> 00:05:03.414 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Right.

00:05:03.414 --> 00:05:04.311 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:05:04.311 --> 00:05:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Neurofeedback.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Neurofeedback,
through heart methods also.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Hooking people up through
the heart as well.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing that people
are moving to those alpha brain

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.240 align:middle line:84%
wave states or theta states
in sometimes 10 seconds.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.675 align:middle line:84%
They're showing that people
are moving into these states.

00:05:21.675 --> 00:05:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful thing
to see scientifically.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: But you can see
it and feel it in the room

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.970 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.080 align:middle line:84%
You can see when
that audience or when

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.520 align:middle line:84%
the people participating--
it's not an audience.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.170 align:middle line:84%
It's participants-- are moving
into a coherent state together.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I
noticed years ago in delving

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.770 align:middle line:84%
into the whole neurofeedback
world and HeartMath

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.230 align:middle line:84%
was that the heart was
noticed to slightly precede

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.900 align:middle line:90%
the brain in response time.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.274 align:middle line:84%
And that goes back and
forth between people.

00:06:02.274 --> 00:06:03.815 align:middle line:84%
We know that they
interact together--

00:06:03.815 --> 00:06:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --Yes.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.960 align:middle line:90%
And people debate this.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: That could
be an arm wrestling match.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember
watching it.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.534 align:middle line:84%
I remember watching it with
both machines hooked up

00:06:09.534 --> 00:06:11.450 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously, even.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And I only bring it
up, because the wisdom

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.400 align:middle line:84%
of the heart, our
knowledge from the heart,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.540 align:middle line:84%
it's not as though it's
some soft instrument that

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.580 align:middle line:90%
lags behind.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.850 align:middle line:84%
It often is recognizing
truth and making a correction

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.440 align:middle line:84%
before the brain
can even pick it up.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Right.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.810 align:middle line:90%
And they're working together.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.896 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:29.896 --> 00:06:30.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.700 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: And that's where
we're becoming so much more

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.520 align:middle line:84%
cognizant of heart
intelligence and how

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.950 align:middle line:84%
to tap into that intelligence,
because they all follow.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.300 align:middle line:84%
When your heart is in
that relaxed state,

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.020 align:middle line:84%
and you're in those smooth,
coherent, orderly rhythms,

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.780 align:middle line:84%
are you going to be
in beta or high beta?

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.660 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: The brain's
going to follow that,

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.470 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to move into
that state, where your body can

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.200 align:middle line:90%
move into rejuvenating itself.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you do want
to go to high beta,

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.730 align:middle line:84%
well, there's plenty
of music for that.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: That's right.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about
targeting that.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not about a
one size fits all.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.780 align:middle line:84%
It's about where you're at
and where you want to go.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's science behind
preferred music now as well.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.100 align:middle line:84%
That preferred music that
you're choosing in the morning,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.860 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing more
and more that that's

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.340 align:middle line:84%
proving to have very
beneficial effects not

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.400 align:middle line:84%
only in day-to-day people's
lives in transformative ways,

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.310 align:middle line:84%
but even in
Alzheimer's patients.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.220 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Well, we're finding
that music has such a strong

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:44.720 align:middle line:84%
connection to memories that
your favorite song 40 years ago

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.890 align:middle line:84%
could now be your lifeline to
coming back into that memory

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.830 align:middle line:90%
in a state of Alzheimer's.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So if I asked you as
an Alzheimer's person

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:59.070 align:middle line:84%
who's going through that, do
you remember me and you and Mom

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.550 align:middle line:90%
sitting together at Christmas?

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And they might
not remember that.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you play
that Christmas song,

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.870 align:middle line:84%
they might be able to
connect with that memory,

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.710 align:middle line:84%
because the music opens up
another pathway to access that.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we're doing
that as a family

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:20.390 align:middle line:84%
with my stepmother, who
is fairly far into decline

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:25.150 align:middle line:84%
in dementia now, and starting
to play music from her era,

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:90%
from the '40s, from the '50s.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.299 align:middle line:84%
And she'll go from a little
bit of-- when we do this,

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:35.770 align:middle line:84%
I notice she'll go from this
bit of a foggy place, and boom.

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.730 align:middle line:84%
She'll be wiggling
her little rear end

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.460 align:middle line:90%
and dancing to the music.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.039 align:middle line:90%
It's so cute.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:42.289 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: That's a miracle.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: It's a miracle
when we think about it,

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.160 align:middle line:84%
and it's awesome that
we have these moments.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.080 align:middle line:84%
But in the life of the
families and the life

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.970 align:middle line:84%
of the patient, those small
moments where they can move out

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.920 align:middle line:84%
of fear and anxiety and just
reconnect with that person

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.680 align:middle line:90%
again, it's amazing.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.896 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: And
Oliver Sacks, who

00:08:59.896 --> 00:09:03.720 align:middle line:84%
studies music and the
quickening, as he called it,

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.520 align:middle line:84%
and watching patients
come to life,

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.604 align:middle line:90%
he called it an awakening.

00:09:07.604 --> 00:09:08.403 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:08.403 --> 00:09:09.490 align:middle line:90%
That's what it looks like.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: And
that's no small feat.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.100 align:middle line:84%
I present in
medical conferences,

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.520 align:middle line:84%
and we show videos of
Alzheimer's patients, who

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.970 align:middle line:84%
are literally in head-down
positions and non-responsive,

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.600 align:middle line:84%
and the role that music
plays within that.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And I always ask, if I
would have shown you this

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:32.270 align:middle line:84%
before and after picture without
telling you it was music,

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:36.700 align:middle line:84%
would you have guessed that
music was the prescription that

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.460 align:middle line:84%
got that person back to that
state, where they were now

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.810 align:middle line:90%
here with us?

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.300 align:middle line:90%
And most of them say no.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.475 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Most
of them say no.

00:09:45.475 --> 00:09:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet it is such
a primitive, deep signaling

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.642 align:middle line:90%
within our being-- music.

00:09:52.642 --> 00:09:54.600 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk a little later
about drumming, even,

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.180 align:middle line:84%
but music where you add
melody to it, specifically.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's why as I said
when I was introducing you,

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.000 align:middle line:84%
I find that if there's a
significant change in life

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.550 align:middle line:84%
going on, I have to find--
I'm kind of restless

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:13.360 align:middle line:84%
until I find the album that
feels right in that changing

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.310 align:middle line:90%
moment.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And then it signifies
that forever, really.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Forever, that time is
always brought back.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.550 align:middle line:84%
But it's as though
we're reaching in

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.140 align:middle line:84%
and need a different set of
frequencies when we change

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.745 align:middle line:90%
anything within our own beings.

00:10:25.745 --> 00:10:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, and
you're creating new memories.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.560 align:middle line:84%
So while music has the ability
to connect us to old memories,

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.160 align:middle line:84%
it also has the ability to shift
us out of old belief systems

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.780 align:middle line:84%
and create completely
different new memories that

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:38.580 align:middle line:90%
can lead us to--

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good point.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.398 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: --elevated
emotions as well.

00:10:41.398 --> 00:10:45.800 align:middle line:84%
So not only does it work with
deprogramming or reprogramming

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.417 align:middle line:84%
our past sometimes, but it
also programs our future.

00:10:49.417 --> 00:10:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's an
interesting point.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Is it used in any way that you
know of kind of therapeutically

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.360 align:middle line:84%
like that to break old patterns
and establish new learning

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.400 align:middle line:90%
patterns, for example?

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.211 align:middle line:84%
Is music used in
learning environments?

00:11:02.211 --> 00:11:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Absolutely.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:03.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us about that.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Sure.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:10.427 align:middle line:84%
Within ADHD children
who are in classes

00:11:10.427 --> 00:11:12.010 align:middle line:84%
who have a hard time
focusing, they're

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:14.370 align:middle line:84%
seeing that music
actually helps them

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.290 align:middle line:84%
bring more attention
with certain subjects

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.850 align:middle line:90%
like arithmetic.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: With
autistic children,

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:24.160 align:middle line:84%
amazing things with
music, which really boosts

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.430 align:middle line:84%
the emotional
intelligence, because they

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:31.280 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of challenges with
connecting certain emotions

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.030 align:middle line:90%
with that feeling.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:middle line:84%
So we can talk
about that, and we

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.025 align:middle line:84%
can describe feelings and
get absolutely nowhere

00:11:38.025 --> 00:11:40.100 align:middle line:90%
with traditional language.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.830 align:middle line:84%
But music as a language,
when I put on a song

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:47.860 align:middle line:84%
like "Happy" by Pharrell
and say, this is happy,

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:50.770 align:middle line:84%
or I play a symphony
by Beethoven

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:54.480 align:middle line:84%
that's in a minor
key, and this is sad.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Now moving forward,
they have a connection,

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.990 align:middle line:84%
an experiential
connection with that,

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:01.600 align:middle line:84%
where their emotional
intelligence is deepened.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:03.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about ADHD
and math, for example.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.300 align:middle line:84%
What would some-- because I know
that our viewers are thinking,

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what that
would sound like.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.440 align:middle line:84%
What kind of music, for
example-- couple examples

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.890 align:middle line:84%
of what would be good for
learning in that environment,

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:17.690 align:middle line:90%
learning math.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Yeah.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is where
preferred music comes in,

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.120 align:middle line:84%
because the music that's
going to help them focus

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.400 align:middle line:90%
is music that they like.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like well when
you recommend vegetables,

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:29.990 align:middle line:84%
because you know they're
good for kids, right?

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:31.448 align:middle line:84%
When you recommend
your music, it's

00:12:31.448 --> 00:12:32.910 align:middle line:90%
probably not going to work.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:33.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not one size fits all.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: So
creating a foundation

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.640 align:middle line:84%
within that, because that's
really-- there's distractions.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.510 align:middle line:84%
So music that are going to
create more foundations,

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:47.370 align:middle line:84%
so popular music, which has a
verse, a chorus, a bridge, they

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.890 align:middle line:90%
know where that song is going--

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Percussion.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:50.381 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Percussion, right.

00:12:50.381 --> 00:12:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Rhythm to kind of
hold it down-- usually

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.470 align:middle line:90%
work better in those conditions.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And well, I think you
answered a little bit

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:03.250 align:middle line:84%
ago talking about working in the
environment with autistic kids.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And one thing with you, you were
a kid when this all started,

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and I love the
story in your book

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.350 align:middle line:84%
about your tiny,
tiny little mother.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.830 align:middle line:84%
You had this just wonderful
little angel of a mother,

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.330 align:middle line:90%
who was 4'7".

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.002 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: That's when
she had her hair done.

00:13:21.002 --> 00:13:21.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Without hair?

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.922 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: She's 4'5"
without her hair done.

00:13:23.922 --> 00:13:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my god.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Just this tiny little woman,
but what a passion for music.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So let's start hearing
about your own life story

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.460 align:middle line:84%
now, an introduction
and your mom to music.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Sure.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.520 align:middle line:84%
One thing I just wanted to
go back for one thing also

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.840 align:middle line:84%
with ADHD, there's
also-- shows that there's

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.360 align:middle line:90%
a lack of dopamine within ADHD.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.080 align:middle line:84%
So there are studies
with music that

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.910 align:middle line:84%
show that it helps to increase
dopamine levels, which is

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.790 align:middle line:90%
based on our pleasure centers.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's important,
again, to have

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.670 align:middle line:84%
them utilize their music
that brings pleasure.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.130 align:middle line:90%
That makes total sense.

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Yeah.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to show the music
also has a pharmacy that's

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:59.030 align:middle line:90%
created from it.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.600 align:middle line:90%
It's not just all pleasure.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.450 align:middle line:84%
It's our physical bodies are
producing specific-- a pharmacy

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:06.510 align:middle line:90%
that benefits us.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to listen
to some cuts of your music

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:12.240 align:middle line:84%
in a little bit, and maybe
you can even, at the time,

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.510 align:middle line:84%
give us an idea of where
dopamine is coming in

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.615 align:middle line:84%
versus, say,
serotonin coming in.

00:14:16.615 --> 00:14:17.415 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:17.415 --> 00:14:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: OK.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:18.620 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.099 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's get
to your personal life

00:14:21.099 --> 00:14:22.140 align:middle line:90%
story for a little while.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Absolutely.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.590 align:middle line:90%
Sorry for interrupting.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.173 align:middle line:84%
Go ahead and tell us about
your mom and how you started.

00:14:26.173 --> 00:14:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: So my mom
at a very young age,

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.800 align:middle line:90%
put me behind a piano.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.440 align:middle line:90%
And this is in my book as well.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.070 align:middle line:84%
It was very touching
to me still,

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:37.410 align:middle line:84%
because it was such
a strong memory that

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:42.400 align:middle line:84%
was embedded in me of literally
my mom's finger on top of mine

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.950 align:middle line:84%
playing the song, "Yellow
Bird" by Harry Belafonte,

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and she was singing,
"Yellow bird."

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember
being in awe of how

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.220 align:middle line:84%
the notes she was singing
were connected to the music

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:57.420 align:middle line:84%
and how the notes hung
in the air of the room

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.510 align:middle line:90%
and filled the space.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was my first
really transformational moment

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:07.350 align:middle line:84%
with music, where I just
knew on a heart level

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:10.970 align:middle line:84%
that music was always
going to be in my life.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And so throughout my life,
I was nurtured very much

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:22.730 align:middle line:84%
within my household, and through
the ranks, learned guitar.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was
always a way to tap

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.700 align:middle line:90%
into a state of creation.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.370 align:middle line:84%
That's always been
my primary thing.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.530 align:middle line:84%
It's like I remember sitting
on the edge of my bed

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and learning three chords
and writing a song to that

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.980 align:middle line:84%
and saying, oh, my god, this did
not exist a half an hour ago.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Being able to create with
music and always a vehicle

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:50.500 align:middle line:84%
to share my passion,
to share my purpose.

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
really motivates me with music

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.820 align:middle line:84%
is utilizing it as a
tool to help people

00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:84%
reach their passion and their
purpose, to kind of move

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.080 align:middle line:84%
to that vulnerable, naked
state, where we can reconnect

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.080 align:middle line:90%
with our heart and find that.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And so many times, when we're in
illness and health challenges,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.800 align:middle line:84%
we lose that conversation
with our hearts,

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.740 align:middle line:84%
because we're in
a state of fear.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And we need to reconnect,
and music restarts

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.430 align:middle line:90%
that beautiful conversation.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:22.805 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as you're talking,
what I'm feeling in this

00:16:22.805 --> 00:16:27.310 align:middle line:84%
and what strikes me is that
it was also this family

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:84%
bonding, this love-- music
and love and your mother's

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:32.010 align:middle line:90%
generous spirit.

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:34.410 align:middle line:84%
None of that can
be separated out

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.320 align:middle line:84%
when you started with
your musical roots.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.120 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.161 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: That's true.

00:16:38.161 --> 00:16:39.880 align:middle line:90%
I never thought of it that way.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
just shows how music

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.230 align:middle line:84%
can be used within the
family dynamic also,

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.980 align:middle line:84%
how healing it is
within a family dynamic

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:52.680 align:middle line:84%
if even one person
takes up an instrument.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that a little bit,

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.760 align:middle line:84%
about, say, one child
in a family of five

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.310 align:middle line:90%
takes up the piano.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Right

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
potential for what that

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.220 align:middle line:90%
brings to that family.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Well, absolutely.

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:05.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And my sister was
a piano player,

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and she was more
technically based,

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:13.640 align:middle line:84%
and she went to high school in
music in art and took lessons,

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.849 align:middle line:84%
and I was kind of the other
way, where I wasn't really

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:20.060 align:middle line:84%
taught a lot of the
technical aspects of music.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And I was more
improvisational, so

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:26.450 align:middle line:84%
a perfect aspect of how music
affects both the right and left

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:27.250 align:middle line:90%
side of the brain.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.062 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:28.062 --> 00:17:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: And you
know, it obviously creates

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.380 align:middle line:90%
bonding in the family as well.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.564 align:middle line:90%
We had our own concerts.

00:17:33.564 --> 00:17:35.230 align:middle line:84%
It was like the time
of Donny and Marie,

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:39.910 align:middle line:84%
so we were like the Donny and
Marie of the Bronx, you know.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it brought the
family closer together as well.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And that was probably
my favorite part

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.130 align:middle line:84%
of raising my son,
because he was naturally

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:53.480 align:middle line:84%
good at music, not a
great student, dyslexic.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.490 align:middle line:90%
Really hard to read music.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:56.900 align:middle line:90%
Just kind of slogged through it.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.090 align:middle line:90%
But he could create.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:59.190 align:middle line:90%
He could compose.

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And either way, I just--
some of the happiest days

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.520 align:middle line:84%
were just being in the
background of his life,

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.340 align:middle line:84%
while he was playing
the piano or the guitar

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.262 align:middle line:90%
and falling asleep.

00:18:11.262 --> 00:18:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Often, he'd be practicing
later at night,

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:14.670 align:middle line:90%
and falling asleep to that.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.940 align:middle line:84%
It just added so much
love to the household.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Right.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which I-- when I was
a kid and playing the piano,

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.660 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't like that.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like, would you please
stop playing the same song

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:29.020 align:middle line:90%
over and over?

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:30.560 align:middle line:90%
It was like, oh, OK.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.750 align:middle line:84%
So they put the piano
in my bedroom, locked me

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:36.864 align:middle line:84%
in there, just-- I'd stay in
all weekend to learn a new song.

00:18:36.864 --> 00:18:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Well,
initially, I was a drummer,

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and I lived in an
apartment complex.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, no.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.596 align:middle line:90%
That's especially irritating.

00:18:41.596 --> 00:18:43.137 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: So that
kind of went out

00:18:43.137 --> 00:18:44.925 align:middle line:90%
the window within that.

00:18:44.925 --> 00:18:47.337 align:middle line:84%
But 40 years ago,
if you would've

00:18:47.337 --> 00:18:48.920 align:middle line:84%
told me I would've
been putting people

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.320 align:middle line:84%
to sleep every night with
music as a rock musician,

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.130 align:middle line:84%
I would have considered
that insulting.

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:59.310 align:middle line:84%
But now being part
of people's solutions

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:03.137 align:middle line:84%
to be able to sleep at
night is such a big thing.

00:19:03.137 --> 00:19:04.345 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not an insult.

00:19:04.345 --> 00:19:05.636 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: It's a compliment.

00:19:05.636 --> 00:19:08.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not that I'm recognized
in the Metamucil aisle.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:09.620 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's Barry Goldstein.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.644 align:middle line:90%
He puts me to sleep every night.

00:19:11.644 --> 00:19:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:13.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So your life, after-- you played
music throughout your life,

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.250 align:middle line:84%
and you decided to go into
the recording industry.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.842 align:middle line:90%
And you were back east, right?

00:19:19.842 --> 00:19:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: I was
back east, yeah.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No,
that's, as I recall,

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:27.430 align:middle line:84%
you said it took something like
100, 150 hours to put together

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:28.610 align:middle line:90%
a four-minute piece.

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Right.

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:31.408 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there is a lot
of stress that goes with this.

00:19:31.408 --> 00:19:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about your life
and how that transition

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.030 align:middle line:84%
and just grinding out
the technical aspects,

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:38.864 align:middle line:90%
how it affected you.

00:19:38.864 --> 00:19:39.663 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Yeah.

00:19:39.663 --> 00:19:41.260 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
times when we're

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.110 align:middle line:84%
moving to what we want
to be when we're a kid,

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:48.220 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't always pan out the
way that you thought it did.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:84%
So I always wanted to be
a professional musician,

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.705 align:middle line:84%
and wow, imagine just being
able to do that as a livelihood.

00:19:53.705 --> 00:19:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
got to that point

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.610 align:middle line:84%
where I could, and I was
doing that, what I noticed

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.100 align:middle line:90%
was that I was losing my heart.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:84%
I was losing contact with
that 14-year-old kid sitting

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:08.780 align:middle line:84%
on the edge of his bed, who was
like enthralled to be writing

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:09.840 align:middle line:90%
a song.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I really, in that process
of creating the 100-hour songs,

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:19.750 align:middle line:84%
I was losing my love in the mix
of deadlines and commitments

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.840 align:middle line:90%
like everybody else was.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And I started asking myself,
how do I get back to that place,

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:30.900 align:middle line:84%
where I can connect,
again, music with my heart?

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was an experiment,
really, for me.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And I started doing
some online research,

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:41.700 align:middle line:84%
and I found out that the
human heart at a relaxed state

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.030 align:middle line:84%
beats between 60 and
70 beats per minute

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.314 align:middle line:90%
depending on the person.

00:20:46.314 --> 00:20:47.730 align:middle line:84%
I was like, wow,
what would happen

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.560 align:middle line:84%
if I took the
pressure off myself,

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.280 align:middle line:84%
and I just started taking
these hour-long journeys

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.210 align:middle line:84%
with my metronome set
at 60 beats per minute?

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:58.130 align:middle line:90%
And as my--

00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just playing to it.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:00.433 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Yeah,
just playing to it,

00:21:00.433 --> 00:21:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and allowing myself
to resynchronize

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:04.740 align:middle line:90%
in the process of composing.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you became
your own physician.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:07.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDSTEIN: Yeah.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.870 align:middle line:84%
I really did, because I
didn't think anyone would

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.090 align:middle line:90%
be listening to this music.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:15.170 align:middle line:84%
But I realized in that state,
I was moving to the zone.

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.550 align:middle line:84%
I was resynchronizing
with my heart.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:18.350 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.391 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: How does that go?

00:21:19.391 --> 00:21:22.665 align:middle line:84%
Do 60 per second with just
that beats, so people feel it.

00:21:22.665 --> 00:21:28.458 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: It would
probably be-- boom.

00:21:28.458 --> 00:21:32.064 align:middle line:84%
[COUNTING BEATS]
Somewhere in there.

00:21:32.064 --> 00:21:33.730 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So it's almost
a hypnotic state.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.180 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: It is.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:39.410 align:middle line:84%
You move into it very easily,
because that metronome that's

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:43.010 align:middle line:84%
in the music-- and this is
the powerful part to me.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:45.280 align:middle line:84%
You have a metronome
in your heart.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.930 align:middle line:90%
Your heart is a metronome.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And it has the ability to
adapt to a musical piece.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So when we're listening
to that music,

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.380 align:middle line:84%
it's just like effortlessly
coming into that space

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.140 align:middle line:90%
of moving back into the heart.

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what it did for me.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:05.370 align:middle line:84%
It moved me back into my
heart, and I started composing.

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:09.552 align:middle line:84%
I created six CDs worth of
material with that thinking

00:22:09.552 --> 00:22:10.510 align:middle line:90%
no one would ever hear.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:11.780 align:middle line:90%
These were for me.

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And people ended up using
them to birth their children

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:22.360 align:middle line:84%
into the world, for sleeping
challenges, for dementia.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.950 align:middle line:90%
My friend's mom had dementia.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:25.960 align:middle line:90%
Can I try one of your pieces?

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And she ended up
using it every night.

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:32.540 align:middle line:84%
She started calling
it her music.

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the
circle of life and hospice,

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.760 align:middle line:84%
where people are needing
to move out of that

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:43.030 align:middle line:84%
contracted state and move
into a more expensive state

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:43.830 align:middle line:90%
to transition.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:44.630 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Make the transition.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:46.080 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Exactly.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So what started as an
experiment for me ended up

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.950 align:middle line:84%
being an amazing
process of assisting

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.740 align:middle line:84%
myself and others to
use them beneficially

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.370 align:middle line:90%
and in medical settings as well.

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And that really sparked my
intention of writing the book

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and finding out more about
why that was happening.

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And research over an extended
period of time as well.

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.780 align:middle line:84%
My fiancee was a
big part of that,

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:22.340 align:middle line:84%
and she was using my music
in her clinics for insomnia.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And when I told
her my intention is

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:27.110 align:middle line:84%
I want to get this
out there medically,

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and it became all
about, OK, well,

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:31.920 align:middle line:90%
we have to speak that language.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And the language that
creates that opening

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.240 align:middle line:84%
is the language of
science and research.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.040 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:38.956 align:middle line:90%
And she's big on that.

00:23:38.956 --> 00:23:40.620 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
Dr. Donese Worden.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:41.080 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:41.530 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And so the two of you
have been collaborating,

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:47.340 align:middle line:84%
because her thing is energy
medicine in large part.

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And so between the
two of you, you

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.980 align:middle line:84%
had the ability to begin almost
running your own research.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:53.780 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Exactly.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And my music this year
is being researched

00:23:56.910 --> 00:24:00.150 align:middle line:84%
by several universities,
where in conjunction with Dr.

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Daniel Amen, to
conduct more research.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:04.862 align:middle line:84%
We've been talking
about our health.

00:24:04.862 --> 00:24:07.070 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're at a good
time in our consciousness,

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:11.180 align:middle line:84%
where people are starting to
understand that music moves

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.730 align:middle line:90%
beyond art and entertainment.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:13.530 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes..

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.300 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: And it's
a support mechanism

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:21.130 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of health
challenges and chronic issues,

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:24.540 align:middle line:84%
as well as being low
cost and noninvasive.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:25.540 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: And pleasurable.

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:26.665 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: And pleasurable.

00:24:26.665 --> 00:24:27.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:30.220 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Bringing about all
the cascade of the good brain

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.020 align:middle line:90%
chemicals.

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:31.470 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: That's right.

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.690 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Let's talk about the
Sacred Heartbeat Process.

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:34.490 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: OK.

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:35.780 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, I created this process
when I lived in New York,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.670 align:middle line:84%
and so my recording
studio was 15 blocks away.

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And I would start my day
as you do with music,

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:47.890 align:middle line:90%
and I would be all zenned out.

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:49.340 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's going to be an amazing.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And in 15 blocks, I would move
through a multitude of sounds

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:58.760 align:middle line:84%
and things going on, everything
from people begging for money

00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.655 align:middle line:90%
to smells--

00:24:59.655 --> 00:25:00.970 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Taxis honking.

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:04.070 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: Taxis honking,
ambulances, and by the time

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:05.690 align:middle line:84%
I got to my recording
studio, and I

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:07.940 align:middle line:84%
wanted to be in that
state of creation,

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.800 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I was
in a contracted state.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't in that
expansive state,

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.530 align:middle line:84%
where I could connect
and bring music through.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:18.650 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to create
a process that I

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:22.080 align:middle line:84%
could do in very short periods
of time that would put me back

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.840 align:middle line:90%
in contact with my heart.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.740 align:middle line:90%
That's where I create from.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:30.360 align:middle line:84%
So what better way than
to touch our hearts?

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And I just really feel
strongly about this

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.750 align:middle line:90%
that we've lost connection.

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Many of us say that we want
to lead a more heart-centered

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.252 align:middle line:84%
life, but when you
ask someone, OK, well,

00:25:40.252 --> 00:25:41.710 align:middle line:84%
when was the last
time you actually

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:45.380 align:middle line:84%
listened to your heart, we
have a whole inner symphony.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.720 align:middle line:90%
I call this our inner music.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.690 align:middle line:84%
So the Sacred
Heartbeat Process is

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.560 align:middle line:84%
geared towards putting
your hands on your heart,

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.790 align:middle line:84%
and you start by
taking a big breath in.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:00.270 align:middle line:84%
You bring that breath in all
the way through your feet,

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:03.180 align:middle line:84%
moving through your lower body,
all the way up to the heart.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:04.590 align:middle line:90%
And then you release it.

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:07.940 align:middle line:90%
So if it'd be kind of like this.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.720 align:middle line:90%
And out.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And then the second breath,
you move that breath

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.480 align:middle line:90%
in through the top of your head.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.170 align:middle line:84%
You move it through
your upper body,

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:90%
through your upper centers.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.980 align:middle line:90%
You breathe into the heart.

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:22.270 align:middle line:90%
And you release it.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you take a breath
in through the heart,

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.260 align:middle line:84%
and a breath out
through the heart.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is you
start to really reconnect

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.230 align:middle line:90%
with your own unique vibration.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:35.059 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:26:35.059 --> 00:26:36.100 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: You have that.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.380 align:middle line:90%
Nobody else does.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.150 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's heart sounds the same.

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:40.990 align:middle line:90%
Nobody else's breath.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:43.050 align:middle line:90%
And you start to re-listen.

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:44.390 align:middle line:90%
Wow, what is my passion?

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:45.250 align:middle line:90%
What is my purpose?

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:47.390 align:middle line:90%
What am I here to share?

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Do it in your day
in five minutes when

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:52.790 align:middle line:90%
you feel you need it.

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:54.020 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Very centering.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:54.520 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Mm-hm.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.270 align:middle line:90%
Very centering.

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:56.800 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Well, how
about if we listen

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.590 align:middle line:90%
to one of your pieces of music?

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Since you're here,
it's the morning,

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:02.820 align:middle line:84%
you've done your Sacred
Heartbeat Process, right?

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:03.620 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.203 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And now we're going to
listen to a piece of music that

00:27:06.203 --> 00:27:08.470 align:middle line:84%
might accompany that, and
then once it comes up,

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.540 align:middle line:90%
we'll be quiet for a little bit.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And then you can explain to us
why that particular piece, what

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:15.600 align:middle line:90%
it's doing to us.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is called, "Heart
Codes" in the gratitude.

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:22.260 align:middle line:84%
It's for gratitude, which is
a good way to start the day.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.190 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Absolutely.

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:26.230 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: So let's take a listen.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:30.230 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:30.230 --> 00:28:10.230 align:middle line:90%


00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.230 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Before we totally drift off into
meditation, which I thought,

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.690 align:middle line:84%
I think I just want
to do this, you

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:18.980 align:middle line:90%
can hear the reverence in it.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:22.040 align:middle line:84%
But talk about what you're
doing, what you're creating

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.490 align:middle line:90%
there to start the day.

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:24.290 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: OK.

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:26.706 align:middle line:84%
Well, for this piece, I'd love
to talk to you a little bit

00:28:26.706 --> 00:28:29.360 align:middle line:84%
about the compositional
process as well,

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.190 align:middle line:84%
because this is where
that kind of secret recipe

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:35.920 align:middle line:90%
kind of comes in to creation.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
about the frequency.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:41.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
the intention.

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:44.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about the emotion
or just about the harmonics.

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.100 align:middle line:90%
It's about all of them together.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.350 align:middle line:10%
So my intention when
I created a Heart Code

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:51.920 align:middle line:10%
was about bringing people
to a sacred place, where

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:56.150 align:middle line:10%
they can discover and
listen to their own hearts.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:58.670 align:middle line:84%
So before I moved
into that process,

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:02.610 align:middle line:84%
I always had to be emotionally
aligned with that intention,

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:06.120 align:middle line:84%
because you can have an
intention, but if I walk in

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.790 align:middle line:84%
and I'm in an angry
state, that's going

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.140 align:middle line:90%
to go into the music as well.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.430 align:middle line:84%
So I would have to move
to that reverent state

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:15.730 align:middle line:84%
that you're talking
about beforehand.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And in the Heart
Codes, that is created.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:22.860 align:middle line:84%
I would not be
creating in that space

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.050 align:middle line:84%
if I was in a mood that was
out of context with that.

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:29.160 align:middle line:84%
So that is what you're
feeling within that reverence.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's where
music is going now.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.750 align:middle line:84%
We're calling it designer music,
being able to design and put

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.810 align:middle line:84%
specific emotions
and music, because we

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:39.670 align:middle line:90%
know it carries a field.

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And so this, again, is
composed at 60 beats per minute

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.400 align:middle line:84%
to move to that state,
but really, the intention

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:51.120 align:middle line:84%
is also to move into those
elevated emotions of kindness,

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:54.980 align:middle line:84%
compassion, gratitude, and
not just for our emotions.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:59.300 align:middle line:84%
But we know, we've studied
that these emotions bring us

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.920 align:middle line:84%
into a state that's coherent
and also affect our heart

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:06.660 align:middle line:84%
rate variability, which is
our measurement of our heart

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:07.460 align:middle line:90%
health.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:08.260 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:12.000 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: And also works with
bringing our immune functions

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.430 align:middle line:84%
up and bettering it,
our cognitive abilities,

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.140 align:middle line:84%
and also dealing
with environmental

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.760 align:middle line:84%
stresses and
stresses that go on.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.550 align:middle line:84%
So that was really geared
towards the emotional body

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:28.330 align:middle line:84%
affecting the physical body,
clearing the mental body,

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:31.130 align:middle line:84%
and then having a deepening
connection in the spiritual.

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:31.930 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:32.800 align:middle line:90%
Very beautiful.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:33.674 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Thank you.

00:30:33.674 --> 00:30:35.890 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And you said the
word, "field" a moment ago,

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:38.490 align:middle line:84%
which brings me into one
of my next questions,

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:44.140 align:middle line:84%
which is, it's creating a
field beyond the audible range.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a point
you made in your book,

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:49.650 align:middle line:84%
where Donese, who you
classify as a poster

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:53.140 align:middle line:84%
girl for a type A personality,
she's lit up, passionate,

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.530 align:middle line:84%
ready to go, researching
day and night,

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:57.840 align:middle line:84%
practicing medicine
in the daytime,

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:01.200 align:middle line:84%
and she came in and asked
you to-- what'd she say?

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.070 align:middle line:84%
She was-- you need to turn
that down or something,

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:09.280 align:middle line:84%
because it was interfering
with her state, her beta state.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.750 align:middle line:90%
It was relaxing her too much.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:13.011 align:middle line:90%
You had headphones on.

00:31:13.011 --> 00:31:14.760 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: Well, I
started out with it on.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:15.320 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.320 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: And it
was so funny to me,

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.435 align:middle line:84%
because my mom-- I used to
get that knock on the door

00:31:18.435 --> 00:31:20.300 align:middle line:84%
when I was a kid, but I was
playing electric guitar.

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:20.720 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:21.670 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: So I
thought those days were

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:23.580 align:middle line:84%
gone of getting the
knock, and here I

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:26.780 align:middle line:84%
am getting a knock for
playing relaxational music.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:27.857 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: I need my edge.

00:31:27.857 --> 00:31:29.440 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: So I put
on the headphones,

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.100 align:middle line:84%
and Donese-- I heard
the knock again.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.062 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, what?

00:31:32.062 --> 00:31:33.280 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And she's like,
it's not working.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.240 align:middle line:90%
I still feel it.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And that field that
she felt initially

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:43.610 align:middle line:84%
that was moving her into
that slower brain wave state

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:44.930 align:middle line:90%
was still there.

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:48.000 align:middle line:84%
She was feeling it coming
from the space of the room.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:48.800 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.490 align:middle line:84%
It was still there in the
room, even though by this time,

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:52.620 align:middle line:90%
you did have headphones on.

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:53.100 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: That's right.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:53.430 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:54.340 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So she
wasn't hearing it.

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.130 align:middle line:90%
She was--

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:55.810 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: She was feeling it.

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:57.520 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: It infiltrated
into the space.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.728 align:middle line:90%
And this is really important.

00:31:58.728 --> 00:32:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Again, these are just
resonant energy systems,

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:03.170 align:middle line:90%
energy carrying systems.

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:04.170 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: That's right.

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:05.970 align:middle line:90%
It's energy medicine.

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:08.770 align:middle line:84%
It's just like you have a
TENS machine or a TENS unit

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:09.850 align:middle line:90%
that you're using.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:13.855 align:middle line:84%
Music has the capacity
as well to be that field,

00:32:13.855 --> 00:32:14.970 align:middle line:90%
to carry that.

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:15.240 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.700 align:middle line:90%
So now let's talk about Donese.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's say she wants to
stay in her beta state,

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.860 align:middle line:90%
because she has a lot to do.

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:24.390 align:middle line:84%
What are some good
examples to you--

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:26.220 align:middle line:84%
this is preferential,
we know this-- to you

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:29.000 align:middle line:84%
of really kind of good
beta-driving music when

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:29.990 align:middle line:90%
we have to stay up?

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:31.460 align:middle line:90%
We gotta keep the mind clicking.

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:32.260 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Right.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, Donese's favorite-- I
call it a musical pinnacle

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.810 align:middle line:90%
or a happy song.

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:40.534 align:middle line:84%
Her favorite song is
"Kung Fu Fighting."

00:32:40.534 --> 00:32:41.334 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:41.334 --> 00:32:42.460 align:middle line:90%
That's cute.

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.126 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: And when
she listens to that,

00:32:44.126 --> 00:32:45.740 align:middle line:84%
she's going to move
into that state.

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.120 align:middle line:90%
Like you immediately go there.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:47.450 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:48.250 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Right?

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.620 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's the Jackson
5, "The Love You Save."

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:51.550 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:53.320 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: And as
soon as I hear that.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And what's amazing to me is
that these emotional states,

00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:58.740 align:middle line:84%
when we're moving
to them, people

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.350 align:middle line:84%
don't realize how
much of an impact

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:04.450 align:middle line:84%
they play on chronic things like
anxiety, working with anxiety,

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:06.340 align:middle line:90%
or working with insomnia.

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:10.210 align:middle line:84%
I had someone come up to me
at a conference and ask me,

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:13.240 align:middle line:84%
she said, I experience
anxiety all the time.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm constantly having
anxiety attacks.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:18.574 align:middle line:84%
What music would
you suggest for me?

00:33:18.574 --> 00:33:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think she thought
I was going to suggest

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:22.320 align:middle line:90%
like meditational music.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:25.360 align:middle line:84%
But in this specific
case, I asked

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.730 align:middle line:90%
her, what's your happy song?

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:29.910 align:middle line:84%
What song, when
you listen to it,

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:32.980 align:middle line:84%
you have a hard time being
in a state of anxiety?

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And even before
she said it, I can

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:39.060 align:middle line:84%
see her moving out of
anxiety and asking me.

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.670 align:middle line:90%
And she said, "Greensleeves."

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:41.470 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Oh, god.

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:43.390 align:middle line:84%
I used to play that on
the piano hours on end.

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:44.190 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Right.

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her, I said, can
you close your eyes right now?

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.163 align:middle line:84%
Close your eyes right now,
and imagine that you're

00:33:49.163 --> 00:33:50.380 align:middle line:90%
hearing "Greensleeves."

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:51.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's amazing.

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.090 align:middle line:84%
She was moving out of the state
and having those benefits.

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:57.100 align:middle line:90%
And then we've researched this.

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.880 align:middle line:84%
We show that people
having that state, where

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.145 align:middle line:84%
they're not hearing the
music, have the same benefit.

00:34:03.145 --> 00:34:05.950 align:middle line:84%
And they're already
going to that state.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:08.199 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: That's
interesting, because just

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:10.040 align:middle line:84%
since you said
"Kung Fu Fighting,"

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:10.350 align:middle line:90%
I can't get it out of--

00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:11.285 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: You can't
get it out of your head.

00:34:11.285 --> 00:34:13.076 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So I'm going
to be saying, darn it.

00:34:13.076 --> 00:34:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Why'd you say that
three days from now?

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:16.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, when those
things get stuck,

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:17.820 align:middle line:84%
and you can't shake
it from your brain.

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:18.210 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Right.

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:19.080 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.830 align:middle line:84%
So people who are
watching, I invite

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:23.530 align:middle line:84%
them to write down your
happy song now, and know

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:24.330 align:middle line:90%
what that is.

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Because as we said before,
that could be your lifeline

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.270 align:middle line:84%
back in 40 years from
now, 50 years from now.

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:31.879 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: That's a really
good point, your happy song.

00:34:31.879 --> 00:34:32.679 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of happy
songs, because I

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:41.040 align:middle line:84%
want to go into some of the
more specific elements of music,

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.850 align:middle line:90%
major, minor chords, and so on.

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:43.650 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Sure.

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:46.170 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: But in terms
of personal resonance,

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:49.909 align:middle line:84%
you and Donese turned
out had this song

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:53.159 align:middle line:84%
that you identified
with idealized love.

00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:54.469 align:middle line:90%
So tell us this story.

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:56.090 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: This
is so wild to me.

00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Talk about signs
from the universe.

00:34:58.420 --> 00:34:59.330 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:02.100 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: I always
had told friends,

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.240 align:middle line:84%
one of my favorite
songs is-- actually, no.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I said the song that-- it
sounds kind of morbid-- when

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.810 align:middle line:84%
I die, I want to be
buried to this song,

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:11.350 align:middle line:90%
because it always made me happy.

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:12.190 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:14.270 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: And so the
song is, "Could It

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Be I'm Falling in
Love," by The Spinners.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's a great song, but
it's not like a commonly known

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.900 align:middle line:90%
by everybody.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:21.700 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:22.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.560 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: I mean it's not like,
"Joy to the World," or ---.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.500 align:middle line:84%
So when I asked
Donese when we first

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.380 align:middle line:84%
started seeing each other
what your favorite song was,

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:33.060 align:middle line:84%
and I heard from the other side
of the phone, "Could It Be I'm

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Falling in Love,"
by The Spinners,

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.770 align:middle line:84%
the first thing that popped in
my head was like, oh, my god.

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:39.450 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: How is this possible?

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:40.825 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: I was
like, she is not

00:35:40.825 --> 00:35:43.510 align:middle line:84%
going to believe that that's
my favorite song as well.

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And when I talked to her, it
was really a sign to both of us

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:51.160 align:middle line:84%
that we were very much
in harmony and resonance

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.320 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.120 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Very much so, because then when
you started your relationship,

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:57.890 align:middle line:84%
as I've heard you
say off camera,

00:35:57.890 --> 00:36:00.790 align:middle line:84%
it's like it was
just like a glove.

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:01.590 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:04.680 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: You were already in
harmony before you began.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And so this notion of music
as a bridge, in general,

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:13.230 align:middle line:84%
was really kind of serving
that role for you two

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:15.690 align:middle line:84%
to help you in the
recognition that this

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:18.744 align:middle line:84%
is a beautiful compatible thing
that's just starting up here.

00:36:18.744 --> 00:36:19.660 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Absolutely.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:20.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And you know, harmony
is not just a word that

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:24.610 align:middle line:90%
exists in the musical language.

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:27.420 align:middle line:84%
I always think of
music as a way of life.

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:29.770 align:middle line:90%
So we're not the same note.

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:31.152 align:middle line:90%
That would be boring.

00:36:31.152 --> 00:36:32.360 align:middle line:90%
But we complement each other.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.960 align:middle line:84%
We're in harmony
with each other,

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and that's something that I go
to in-depth about in the book

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.530 align:middle line:84%
as well is how to identify
who's creating harmony

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:44.890 align:middle line:84%
and who's creating
dissonance in your field.

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:45.690 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:46.920 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.250 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: Well, when we're
creating an intention,

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:51.180 align:middle line:90%
it's a very sacred thing.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
between us and, call it

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:57.740 align:middle line:84%
what you may-- spirit, God,
the universe, the divine.

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.400 align:middle line:84%
When you have that intention,
and you are treating it

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.520 align:middle line:84%
in a sacred way, who
do you want to bring

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.920 align:middle line:90%
into that field with you?

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a sacred field.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And as you start to introduce
people into that field,

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:14.070 align:middle line:84%
you can see who is creating
dissonance in your field.

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:18.350 align:middle line:84%
Who's saying, well, no, I
think that's not a great idea.

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Puncturing holes, energetic
holes in your passion,

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.250 align:middle line:84%
your purpose, what's
in your heart.

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:25.050 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:28.490 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: So it's important
to recognize and build

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:31.840 align:middle line:84%
harmonious spiritual
relationships

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:35.460 align:middle line:84%
and a spiritual team around
you that supports your vision

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:38.860 align:middle line:84%
and to be an observer
and an astute awareness,

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:41.910 align:middle line:84%
and listen to who
is creating harmony

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:44.440 align:middle line:84%
and who is creating
dissonance in your field.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.400 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And you mentioned
this earlier, too.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:51.920 align:middle line:84%
When you're choosing your music,
whatever time of the day it is,

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.850 align:middle line:84%
for whatever purpose,
you're really

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:58.300 align:middle line:84%
looking for music that
creates a sense of expansion,

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.040 align:middle line:84%
where you can feel
your energy moving

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:04.270 align:middle line:84%
outward, more embracing, more
extended, versus contraction.

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:05.910 align:middle line:90%
Talk about this a little bit.

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:06.710 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Yeah.

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, contraction
is-- I compare it

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:11.820 align:middle line:84%
to being like on a winter's day
when you're kind of like this,

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.600 align:middle line:84%
and you're cold, and
you're moving inward.

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Your body's tight,
and you're stressed.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Expansion, I
compare-- and you'll

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.750 align:middle line:84%
love this-- being
on top of a mountain

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:27.120 align:middle line:84%
and being like this, wide
open, feeling like a speck

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.260 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, but
like anything can happen.

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:34.580 align:middle line:84%
So usually during our day, we'll
start off in an expansive way,

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:35.900 align:middle line:90%
but things come into our field.

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Challenges come in, whether
you're working with people

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:43.060 align:middle line:84%
or you're a doctor working with
patients, whatever that is.

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And we can move back into
that contracted state.

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Music is an amazing way to move
back into the expansive state

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:51.700 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:54.300 align:middle line:84%
So asking yourself, what's
going to create expansion for me

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.300 align:middle line:90%
right now?

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Because for me, we don't
only have so much energy

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:03.650 align:middle line:84%
that we can spend and find our
purpose and our passion with.

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And if we're spending
it in states of drama

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:08.810 align:middle line:84%
or spending it in those
contracted states,

00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:11.809 align:middle line:84%
then we have nothing left
for what we're here to do.

00:39:11.809 --> 00:39:12.850 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: That's very true.

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:16.450 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: And so that piece
of music is a reconnection,

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:19.440 align:middle line:84%
where you can move into that
expansive state, ask yourself,

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.250 align:middle line:90%
what am I here for today?

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:23.320 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So practically
speaking, it's

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.360 align:middle line:84%
a really smart
idea for each of us

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.640 align:middle line:84%
to have our own personalized
preferred playlist,

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:32.940 align:middle line:84%
our happy song, our
inspirational song,

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.490 align:middle line:84%
our songs that make
us feel expansive

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:37.100 align:middle line:90%
after we've just contracted.

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:39.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean is there any
music that really-- I

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.320 align:middle line:84%
mean one could say just
by way of preference--

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:44.710 align:middle line:90%
really contracts you?

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:48.015 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: Well, I mean I'm sure
people have listened to songs

00:39:48.015 --> 00:39:49.260 align:middle line:90%
and say, shut that off.

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:50.100 align:middle line:90%
Turn that down.

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:50.900 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:52.520 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: And that's
where we, again,

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:56.080 align:middle line:84%
we become our own experts of
what feels good for us and what

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:56.880 align:middle line:90%
doesn't.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think with the
technology and having access

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:02.860 align:middle line:84%
to so many different
types of music that we now

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:06.020 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to take
it to the next level

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:10.757 align:middle line:84%
with our playlists and
target specific states.

00:40:10.757 --> 00:40:12.590 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: No, I think
that's a wonderful idea.

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:13.465 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Gratitude.

00:40:13.465 --> 00:40:17.940 align:middle line:84%
A playlist for gratitude,
a playlist for inspiration,

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:22.010 align:middle line:84%
a playlist for sensuality,
for all those as opposed

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:24.110 align:middle line:84%
to a day at the beach
or reggae music.

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:26.470 align:middle line:84%
They're great, but let's
bump it up a notch.

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's bring the
awareness up, and know

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.460 align:middle line:84%
that we all have the ability
to be the DJs of our own lives.

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:32.260 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.760 align:middle line:84%
No, I think that's
a wonderful idea.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean I have made
playlists that

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:38.360 align:middle line:84%
are kind of emotion-oriented
like I made one called Queen

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.159 align:middle line:90%
of Clean for cleaning house.

00:40:41.159 --> 00:40:42.450 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: I need to have that.

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:43.575 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Every single upper.

00:40:43.575 --> 00:40:44.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let's do this.

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:46.890 align:middle line:84%
So I'd be bopping along
while I was cleaning.

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And another one I called
Crybaby, the double entendre,

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:56.025 align:middle line:84%
that was just emotionally
sensitive and even sad music.

00:40:56.025 --> 00:40:57.400 align:middle line:84%
But that's as far
as I've gotten.

00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.690 align:middle line:84%
But what you're talking
about for all of us,

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:02.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean I think everyone
listening, why wouldn't we

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:05.360 align:middle line:84%
create our inspiration
list, our peaceful list,

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.630 align:middle line:90%
our motivating list?

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:07.700 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Absolutely.

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:10.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's
musical nourishment.

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:14.610 align:middle line:84%
It's just like we know that
meditation is great for us.

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:16.480 align:middle line:84%
We know that eating
a certain way

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.140 align:middle line:90%
is going to benefit our health.

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:21.790 align:middle line:84%
We know music creates
transformation for us,

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:23.820 align:middle line:84%
but most of the
time, it's random.

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:26.710 align:middle line:84%
We let those pieces
happen to us randomly.

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:29.930 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when you
start to drive that vehicle?

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And you become the person who is
creating a practice around it.

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:40.730 align:middle line:84%
It has the same benefits as
nourishment, as meditation.

00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:42.300 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So on that
note, let's listen

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.591 align:middle line:90%
to another piece of your music.

00:41:43.591 --> 00:41:45.220 align:middle line:90%
This is more for midday, right?

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:45.680 align:middle line:90%
This is called--

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.000 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:46.940 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Is it
"Abundance Rising?"

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:47.620 align:middle line:90%
Is that the name of it?

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.410 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: This is called
"Abundance Rising."

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:50.040 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: "Abundance
Rising," and let's just

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.300 align:middle line:90%
listen to it for a little bit.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.030 align:middle line:84%
This one, we won't be as tempted
to go under like last time.

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:55.060 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: No, we'll
feel ready to go.

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:55.310 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:57.330 align:middle line:84%
We're taking it in a
little bit, because it

00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:58.962 align:middle line:84%
has a ramp-up to
this, so we're going

00:41:58.962 --> 00:42:00.170 align:middle line:90%
to take it in about a minute.

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:00.970 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:02.224 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Sounds good.

00:42:02.224 --> 00:42:06.697 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:42:06.697 --> 00:42:45.470 align:middle line:90%


00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:47.540 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So that starts
ramping up the mojo.

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:49.830 align:middle line:84%
If you've kind of
lost your steam,

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:53.010 align:middle line:84%
it has an inspirational quality
to it as well, I notice.

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:55.750 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: It does, and it has
a lot of nice, low grounding

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:57.140 align:middle line:90%
frequencies in there.

00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:59.740 align:middle line:84%
But it also has
Gregorian chantings,

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:01.810 align:middle line:84%
so it brings in the
heavenly aspects.

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:04.270 align:middle line:84%
It has some hip hop beats
in the middle of it,

00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:06.180 align:middle line:84%
so it's a little
bit more modern.

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's great to work with
breathing and releasing energy

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.610 align:middle line:84%
that you're holding
in your physical body.

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:15.140 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And you know, how
systems such as Hemi-Sync

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:19.110 align:middle line:84%
and others have been created
that use these basic beats

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:22.350 align:middle line:84%
and binaural beats and so
forth to kind of subconsciously

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:23.150 align:middle line:90%
affect the brain.

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:26.244 align:middle line:84%
But as we've learned, I mean
it's not a one size fits all.

00:43:26.244 --> 00:43:27.910 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: It's not
a one size fits all,

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:30.420 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's
important as well.

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:34.260 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking about
using music as medicine,

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:35.830 align:middle line:84%
that we have to
think of it that way,

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:39.100 align:middle line:84%
that each person is like a
patient that we're treating.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.750 align:middle line:90%
They're individual.

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And what might
work for one person

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:45.040 align:middle line:90%
might not work for the other.

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And the music, I feel, at some
times, gets negated in the talk

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:54.190 align:middle line:84%
about that, because it's very
much about the composition

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:55.040 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.739 align:middle line:90%
It's not just the technology.

00:43:56.739 --> 00:43:58.030 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's the composition.

00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:58.700 align:middle line:90%
It's the emotion.

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:00.250 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And you're getting
the intention of the composer.

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:00.820 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Exactly.

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:02.210 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And the emotion
of the composer.

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:03.168 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: All of that.

00:44:03.168 --> 00:44:05.780 align:middle line:84%
So when you combine
all of that together,

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:10.560 align:middle line:84%
that's going to have a
powerful effect on the listener

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.310 align:middle line:84%
if it's something that
they resonate with.

00:44:12.310 --> 00:44:15.040 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: We talked about this
off camera, because every now

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.790 align:middle line:84%
and then, there's a
song that comes along,

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:20.380 align:middle line:84%
and it may be the one hit
of that particular recording

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:21.210 align:middle line:90%
artist.

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:25.600 align:middle line:84%
But it comes along, and it
hits such a chord in everybody

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.780 align:middle line:84%
that it becomes like an
overnight hit really.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And they can kind
of hang their hat

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:32.810 align:middle line:84%
on that for the
rest of their lives.

00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the old days anyway
with royalties and performances

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:37.130 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:40.670 align:middle line:84%
What is it that's happening
with that one song

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:44.044 align:middle line:84%
that kind of everybody
seems to relate to?

00:44:44.044 --> 00:44:46.710 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: Well, I have a theory
that I love-- my background was

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:51.730 align:middle line:84%
in pop music originally, so I'm
a person who studied pop music.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:54.030 align:middle line:84%
I feel that music
has always been

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:58.100 align:middle line:84%
a representative of what
is happening culturally

00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.700 align:middle line:90%
in our society.

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:04.650 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure for people who are
listening to more modern music,

00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:07.130 align:middle line:84%
if they listen to Bob Dylan,
"Blowing in the Wind,"

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:10.780 align:middle line:84%
they might not think that's a
great song or like his voice.

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:13.970 align:middle line:84%
But at that time, that was one
of the most powerful songs,

00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:17.400 align:middle line:84%
because it captured what
was going on in our country.

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And I feel it's the same
thing when you look at artists

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:23.170 align:middle line:90%
like Alanis Morissette.

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:27.590 align:middle line:84%
She was turned down by lots
of different record labels,

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:34.200 align:middle line:84%
and she hit a common chord that
hit about 23 million people

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.210 align:middle line:90%
when that album came out.

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And when the song, "You
Ought to Know," came out,

00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:43.930 align:middle line:84%
it was expressing an
angst to the relationship

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:45.570 align:middle line:90%
that she was in.

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:47.300 align:middle line:84%
"I want to remind
you of the mess

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.170 align:middle line:90%
you made when you went away."

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:50.010 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:51.660 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: And I
think it hit a chord

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:57.770 align:middle line:84%
with women in that time period
that it's OK to express angst.

00:45:57.770 --> 00:46:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And the music was so
cathartic to do that.

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Music was a vehicle,
so I feel like we

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:06.492 align:middle line:84%
liberated all this energy that
was going on in our society.

00:46:06.492 --> 00:46:07.950 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Trying to
manage it, trying

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:11.690 align:middle line:84%
to manage the stress of a
tough relationship situation.

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:12.490 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Yeah.

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:17.090 align:middle line:84%
We taught them to push that
down, and you don't say that.

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:22.130 align:middle line:84%
So here's a song that gives
people permission to say it.

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:25.090 align:middle line:90%
And 23 million people said it.

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And she won five
Grammys for that.

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's an inspiration
to artists, too,

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:35.500 align:middle line:84%
who have a voice out there that
always follow your inspiration.

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Follow your heart
to get it out there,

00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:41.100 align:middle line:84%
because your voice is
needed out there now.

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:41.980 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: And it does.

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Its drives our emotions
that may be hidden,

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:48.410 align:middle line:84%
like you said, and/or
filled with longing.

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And as you said earlier
too, sometimes it's

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:53.280 align:middle line:84%
just the pure emotional
state the artist was

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.900 align:middle line:90%
in when they created the song.

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Their heart is coming
through to all of us,

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:59.930 align:middle line:84%
and our heart is going
into resonance with them

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:01.360 align:middle line:90%
in pain or pleasure.

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:02.160 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Right.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and with
that, it was like,

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:06.459 align:middle line:84%
yeah, you could feel
that in those songs.

00:47:06.459 --> 00:47:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And then on the other end,
right around that same time,

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:09.950 align:middle line:90%
you had Sarah McLachlan--

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:10.750 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:13.570 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: --who wrote a
beautiful song called "Angel."

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:14.670 align:middle line:90%
And you could feel that.

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:15.620 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:19.460 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: So it really
covers a spectrum

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:23.347 align:middle line:84%
of hitting a common chord of
what people need at that time.

00:47:23.347 --> 00:47:24.930 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Well, let's
talk about chords,

00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:27.205 align:middle line:84%
because when we get
into it technically,

00:47:27.205 --> 00:47:30.400 align:middle line:84%
do you find that people
tend to either be

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:36.350 align:middle line:84%
aligned more disposition-wise
with major versus minor chords?

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:38.500 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: Well, I mean
they have a purpose.

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So major chords are
going to connect us

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:45.110 align:middle line:84%
more in a positive or
uplifting way at times.

00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And then minor chords make
us feel a little bit more sad

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:50.310 align:middle line:90%
or a little bit more sallow.

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:54.207 align:middle line:84%
So composers know these things
when we're creating songs.

00:47:54.207 --> 00:47:56.540 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And it's the contrast
between the two in a song.

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:56.780 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: That's right.

00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we'll go
between major and minor,

00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:01.300 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes we'll
stay in a neutral place

00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:03.670 align:middle line:90%
and just have a drone.

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:04.930 align:middle line:90%
It's all for a purpose.

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes we'll have
a point in a song, where

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:09.110 align:middle line:90%
it's completely quiet.

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And there are studies that
show that during those times

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:16.320 align:middle line:84%
where there is silence, that's
when our attention is caught

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:17.890 align:middle line:90%
even more so from the listener.

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:18.250 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:18.860 align:middle line:90%
I can see that.

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:20.526 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: --And
improves our attention.

00:48:20.526 --> 00:48:21.740 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:24.360 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, thank
you for that answer.

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm just wondering, have you
known-- I mean have you known--

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:29.320 align:middle line:84%
can you tell whether
a person is generally

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.700 align:middle line:84%
the kind that will prefer
major chords to minor chords,

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:32.500 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.135 align:middle line:90%
Like "Rainy Day People."

00:48:34.135 --> 00:48:34.935 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Yeah.

00:48:34.935 --> 00:48:37.600 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Are comforted
by minor chords often.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:41.190 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: Again, I think
that is where you're at

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:middle line:90%
and where you want to go.

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And also, certain things benefit
certain medical things as well,

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:50.770 align:middle line:84%
like when I'm composing music
for sleeping challenges,

00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:52.870 align:middle line:84%
I try to stay in
between the two.

00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm playing
what's called fifths.

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:57.760 align:middle line:84%
So those outside
notes are not defining

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.040 align:middle line:90%
whether it's major or minor.

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the middle note
that defines that.

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And I try to stay in between,
so I don't take people

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:05.710 align:middle line:90%
to emotional states.

00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:07.970 align:middle line:84%
It's more like lighting
a candle in a room right

00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:09.220 align:middle line:90%
before you go to bed.

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:10.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't want a
lot of distractions.

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:12.770 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
listen to a song

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:14.500 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, this
is my favorite part.

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:14.770 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Because now you're alert.

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:16.760 align:middle line:90%
You're paying attention.

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:17.720 align:middle line:90%
Your mind's active again.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:18.210 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Your mind's active.

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:19.550 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:23.939 align:middle line:84%
Which of your CDs--
what's the name of your CD

00:49:23.939 --> 00:49:24.980 align:middle line:90%
that has to do with this?

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I know someone right
now who's just having real sleep

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:28.960 align:middle line:90%
issues.

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:32.830 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, so for
that, my series, "Ambiology,"

00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:35.650 align:middle line:90%
has a CD called "Genesis."

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:40.075 align:middle line:84%
And "Genesis" has been used
clinically for insomnia and--

00:49:40.075 --> 00:49:41.600 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: In sleep clinics?

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:45.030 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: Well, Dr.
Worden, Donese has used it,

00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:47.020 align:middle line:90%
and we're also studying it.

00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:48.810 align:middle line:84%
It's also been used
in hospitals as well

00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:49.810 align:middle line:90%
for sleeping challenges.

00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:50.420 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Does it work?

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:51.350 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Oh, yeah.

00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Because it brings you to that
relaxed state very quickly.

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:57.040 align:middle line:84%
It brings you down to
that 60 beats per minute.

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And I always recommend
that when people

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:03.010 align:middle line:84%
have sleeping challenges, when
you're using music for that,

00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:05.860 align:middle line:84%
it's not just about
putting it on before five

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:08.160 align:middle line:90%
minutes before you go to sleep.

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.330 align:middle line:84%
It's about winding
down and transitioning,

00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:12.630 align:middle line:84%
because so many of us
are going from type A--

00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:13.880 align:middle line:90%
we're on the internet.

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:14.680 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:15.600 align:middle line:90%
It's 2 o'clock in the morning.

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:16.516 align:middle line:90%
I need to go to sleep.

00:50:16.516 --> 00:50:17.320 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Now.

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:17.880 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Right.

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:18.700 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:21.590 align:middle line:84%
To actually wind down,
start treating sleep

00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:25.320 align:middle line:84%
as a more sacred time, put
on that music about an hour

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:29.160 align:middle line:84%
before bed time, and your
body starts to adapt to that.

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:31.920 align:middle line:84%
So it took awhile for
you to move out of sync.

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Give yourself at least 30
days to play that music

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:37.700 align:middle line:84%
and to wind down
before sleep with it.

00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see that you're
staying asleep longer.

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:42.450 align:middle line:84%
You're getting
better quality sleep.

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:43.250 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:46.820 align:middle line:84%
On that note, no pun intended,
let's take a listen to one more

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:47.720 align:middle line:90%
piece of your music.

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is for winding down
at the end of the day called

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:51.740 align:middle line:90%
"Alpha Evening."

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:52.280 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: That's correct.

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.138 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:50:53.138 --> 00:50:57.122 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:50:57.122 --> 00:51:52.950 align:middle line:90%


00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:55.990 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: You can really hear
it bringing it down, quieting

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.986 align:middle line:90%
everything in this.

00:51:56.986 --> 00:51:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And I would think
that that would

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:02.530 align:middle line:84%
be, for a number of reasons,
a really lovely thing

00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:06.240 align:middle line:84%
for a couple to do-- to go to
bed earlier than you would.

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Don't just turn off the
computer and try to crash.

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:11.860 align:middle line:84%
But go to bed earlier,
and listen to music

00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:15.440 align:middle line:84%
together so that you fall
in a resonance together

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:17.099 align:middle line:90%
and dream time together.

00:52:17.099 --> 00:52:18.390 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: That's a great idea.

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:21.360 align:middle line:84%
I totally, totally
agree with you.

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And you know, again,
it's about moving

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:27.880 align:middle line:84%
into that parasympathetic
state, slowing your body down,

00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:30.890 align:middle line:84%
allowing it to
rest and rejuvenate

00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:34.000 align:middle line:84%
so that you could wake up in
that state, where you can share

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.120 align:middle line:90%
your passion and your purpose.

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:36.977 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:52:36.977 --> 00:52:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk--
we're going to-- we

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.870 align:middle line:84%
have some time to still go
into a few other elements.

00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And one is toning and
what kind of part toning

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:46.170 align:middle line:90%
plays in all of this.

00:52:46.170 --> 00:52:49.050 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: So for
toning, I like to tone

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:51.310 align:middle line:84%
through parts of my
body that feel tense

00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:56.210 align:middle line:84%
or feel like they need
to release energy.

00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And I work through
the energy centers,

00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:02.090 align:middle line:84%
sending different
tones to those centers.

00:53:02.090 --> 00:53:04.300 align:middle line:84%
So your tone might be
slightly different than mine,

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:08.460 align:middle line:84%
and it's really about
placing your hands on each

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:12.330 align:middle line:84%
of your energy centers, and
we start with the base, which

00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:13.800 align:middle line:90%
is the base of our spine.

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Within that center, I usually
send the lowest possible sound

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:21.500 align:middle line:84%
that I can of U. And
so in the root chakra,

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:23.730 align:middle line:84%
I send something
that would sound

00:53:23.730 --> 00:53:25.840 align:middle line:90%
like this with a big breath in.

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:29.933 align:middle line:84%
[INHALES] I put my hand
on there, and then I go,

00:53:29.933 --> 00:53:41.037 align:middle line:90%
[LONG, DEEP VOICE] U.

00:53:41.037 --> 00:53:42.870 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm doing when
I'm doing that is I'm

00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:45.470 align:middle line:84%
searching for that
sound that feels

00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:47.070 align:middle line:90%
like it's vibrating my hand.

00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:48.450 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Right, and breaking
up an old energy pattern

00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:49.474 align:middle line:90%
that may be stuck there.

00:53:49.474 --> 00:53:50.390 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Absolutely.

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And you can usually tell as
you go through your centers,

00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:57.600 align:middle line:84%
as you go up, each center
has a different sound

00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:59.270 align:middle line:84%
that you can feel
which ones, oh,

00:53:59.270 --> 00:54:02.640 align:middle line:84%
that one felt really open and
expansive as I tone through it.

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:05.730 align:middle line:84%
That one I could hardly
get any sound through.

00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And as we work with
our energy centers,

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:11.420 align:middle line:84%
there are areas that are geared
toward specific consciousness,

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:13.670 align:middle line:84%
different aspects of
emotions, as you said,

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:14.980 align:middle line:90%
that we hold there.

00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:17.670 align:middle line:84%
So as you see which
ones are blocked,

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:21.760 align:middle line:84%
and you see what that
means-- for instance,

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:25.440 align:middle line:84%
the throat is geared
towards expression,

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:28.280 align:middle line:84%
knowing that your
words are heard,

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:30.380 align:middle line:90%
acknowledged, and appreciated.

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:33.030 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a hard time
toning through that throat

00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:35.490 align:middle line:84%
chakra, it could be
maybe something happened

00:54:35.490 --> 00:54:37.920 align:middle line:84%
at work, where you
didn't feel like you were

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:39.440 align:middle line:84%
heard in that
moment, or you didn't

00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:42.130 align:middle line:90%
get to fully express yourself.

00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Within the third eye, it
could be a lot of mind chatter

00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:48.830 align:middle line:84%
that you've been locked into
a story that's been going on.

00:54:48.830 --> 00:54:51.840 align:middle line:84%
So when you start to realize
that each one of them

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:55.380 align:middle line:84%
has something that is specific
emotionally that ties to it,

00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:57.420 align:middle line:84%
then we have the ability
to tone through it.

00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Work with the ones
that are blocked more,

00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:03.430 align:middle line:84%
and see if it does have
a resonance to something

00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:06.260 align:middle line:84%
that's going on
emotionally in your life,

00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:09.170 align:middle line:84%
because as soon as you do
that, you liberate energy.

00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:11.540 align:middle line:90%
You let energy go, and--

00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:13.210 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Back to that
expansive state.

00:55:13.210 --> 00:55:13.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:14.280 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Exactly.

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.590 align:middle line:84%
You make room for more
energy to come in.

00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Now you've found yourself having
a lot of support in your life,

00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:24.270 align:middle line:84%
because you've cleared your base
chakra or a lot of nurturing,

00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:28.170 align:middle line:84%
or you feel like you're able
to walk more in your path.

00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:29.180 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Now when-- let's
talk about using

00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:34.655 align:middle line:84%
songs for a very specific
reason, because were talk

00:55:34.655 --> 00:55:37.920 align:middle line:84%
quite a bit in your book
about using songs to help

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:40.440 align:middle line:90%
you set and keep an intention.

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:41.814 align:middle line:90%
So let's get into that.

00:55:41.814 --> 00:55:42.730 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Absolutely.

00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:45.560 align:middle line:84%
So I think this is a
part that's usually

00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:48.160 align:middle line:84%
within the sound
healing community,

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:53.160 align:middle line:84%
we don't talk about like
using popular new music a lot.

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
popular music absolutely

00:55:56.170 --> 00:55:58.500 align:middle line:84%
can be healing as
well, especially

00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.490 align:middle line:90%
with creating intention.

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:04.520 align:middle line:84%
This is where songs with
lyrics do assist you.

00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
business meeting,

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.240 align:middle line:84%
and you need to be
geared up, maybe

00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:11.110 align:middle line:84%
"I'm So Excited" by
the Pointer Sisters.

00:56:11.110 --> 00:56:11.660 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:12.040 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:12.910 align:middle line:90%
That's a good one.

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:17.470 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: Or you're an
actress living in Iowa,

00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:21.640 align:middle line:84%
and you know that all your
acting jobs are going to happen

00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.310 align:middle line:90%
if you move to New York.

00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:25.470 align:middle line:84%
So you listen to Frank
Sinatra every day,

00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:27.080 align:middle line:84%
and you put yourself
in that space

00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:29.850 align:middle line:84%
of listening to "New York,
New York," smelling what

00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:33.330 align:middle line:84%
New York-- the sounds and
the smell of the pizza

00:56:33.330 --> 00:56:38.500 align:middle line:84%
coming out from the pizza
shops, and all of the atmosphere

00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:39.320 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And you constantly use this
song to create a field that's

00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:46.820 align:middle line:84%
going to bring that
resonance and that attraction

00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:48.110 align:middle line:90%
into your life.

00:56:48.110 --> 00:56:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And as you move into those
elevated states of emotion,

00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:53.490 align:middle line:90%
that's when intention happens.

00:56:53.490 --> 00:56:55.270 align:middle line:84%
When you're combining
the intention

00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:56.750 align:middle line:90%
and the elevated emotion of--

00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:57.550 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Absolutely.

00:56:57.550 --> 00:57:00.860 align:middle line:84%
People-- that's the one that's
been difficult in the New Age

00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:04.450 align:middle line:84%
community in particular to
kind of break the notion

00:57:04.450 --> 00:57:06.550 align:middle line:84%
that all you have to
do is say, I want this,

00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:08.300 align:middle line:84%
and repeatedly it's
going to happen.

00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:12.510 align:middle line:84%
It's so inextricably intertwined
with the positive emotions

00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:15.560 align:middle line:90%
supporting that experience.

00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:16.660 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Exactly.

00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it moves
into being-- it could

00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:20.740 align:middle line:90%
be a quick fix in any area.

00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:22.880 align:middle line:84%
It could be a quick
fix in New Age,

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:24.885 align:middle line:84%
just as it could be
in the medical arena.

00:57:24.885 --> 00:57:25.760 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right, right.

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:27.660 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: You know,
so for me, it always

00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:31.190 align:middle line:84%
comes back to, again,
what am I here to do?

00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:34.360 align:middle line:84%
How am I here to serve,
and what could put me back

00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:35.240 align:middle line:90%
on track to do that?

00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:36.040 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:38.610 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: What musical piece
can connect me with my heart,

00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:40.420 align:middle line:90%
which is going to speak to that?

00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:42.120 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Well, and for
negative emotions,

00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:43.510 align:middle line:84%
if you want to
pull yourself out,

00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:45.030 align:middle line:84%
you like Bruce
Springsteen, right?

00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:45.830 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: I love--

00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:46.790 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Did I read
that correctly?

00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:47.590 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Yeah.

00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:52.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean I love singing to
Bruce and releasing emotion

00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:56.360 align:middle line:84%
through songs like
"Jungleland" or "Born to Run."

00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:57.970 align:middle line:90%
And it brings me back.

00:57:57.970 --> 00:58:02.020 align:middle line:84%
It brings me back to my roots
of where this all started,

00:58:02.020 --> 00:58:03.850 align:middle line:90%
learning the power of music.

00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:07.240 align:middle line:84%
I think where I learned it
was in my park growing up

00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:09.990 align:middle line:84%
as each of my friends
would play a mix tape.

00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Back then, it was
cassette tapes.

00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And we'd have-- those
are our playlists.

00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:17.357 align:middle line:84%
We have a half an hour to share
what we love listening to.

00:58:17.357 --> 00:58:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
realized like, oh, my god,

00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:22.610 align:middle line:84%
music shifted a friend
who was in depression.

00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Music shifted a friend who had
a gang member in his family, who

00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:29.290 align:middle line:90%
were coming home beaten up.

00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Music shifted my friends
who had alcoholic parents.

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:36.422 align:middle line:84%
And I watched them shift
for those half an hour

00:58:36.422 --> 00:58:38.380 align:middle line:84%
into their own space,
where they were elevated.

00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:39.850 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:40.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:42.076 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is like
you said, you don't even

00:58:42.076 --> 00:58:44.730 align:middle line:84%
have to have whatever
your musical device is,

00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:48.030 align:middle line:84%
your iPod or your iPhone,
whatever, with you anymore.

00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:49.940 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is
remember that song.

00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:50.570 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: That's right.

00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:52.403 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: As soon as you
remember it and start

00:58:52.403 --> 00:58:54.320 align:middle line:84%
going into it in your
head, it's starting

00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.930 align:middle line:84%
to have the same effect through
memory as it does to actually

00:58:56.930 --> 00:58:58.250 align:middle line:90%
listen to it on a device.

00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:59.249 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: That's right.

00:58:59.249 --> 00:59:01.420 align:middle line:84%
As I was just describing
that, I was in the park.

00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:03.520 align:middle line:84%
I was hanging out on
the bench listening.

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:07.880 align:middle line:84%
I could see Joe's boombox
there and all of my friends.

00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:09.940 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So for you,
another one when

00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:12.070 align:middle line:84%
you begin your day, one
of your favorite songs

00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:15.010 align:middle line:84%
is "Morning Has Broken"
by Cat Stevens, which

00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:16.750 align:middle line:90%
is just such a beautiful song.

00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:17.550 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: It is.

00:59:17.550 --> 00:59:18.400 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:21.850 align:middle line:90%
It connects us to nature.

00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:24.120 align:middle line:84%
It connects us to
the miracles that

00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:28.240 align:middle line:84%
are all around us that when we
start our day, that no matter

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:30.080 align:middle line:84%
what's going on,
we have the ability

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:32.290 align:middle line:84%
to tap into the
small things that

00:59:32.290 --> 00:59:33.780 align:middle line:84%
have been created
in the planets,

00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:35.910 align:middle line:90%
in the flowers, the birds.

00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And when we see
those small things,

00:59:38.370 --> 00:59:41.030 align:middle line:84%
and we're able to
connect with those,

00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:44.960 align:middle line:84%
then we move into that space
of gratitude of why we're here.

00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:48.680 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yes, and it is such a
kind of melodic little thing,

00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:49.750 align:middle line:90%
such a beautiful piece.

00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So we each need to find our
own version of "Morning Has

00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:53.410 align:middle line:90%
Broken."

00:59:53.410 --> 00:59:56.830 align:middle line:84%
A good way to start the day,
as you say, with gratitude.

00:59:56.830 --> 00:59:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, you've
done the hard work

00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:01.960 align:middle line:84%
in that you created all
these different CDs that

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.690 align:middle line:84%
have these different
compilations on them

01:00:03.690 --> 01:00:05.474 align:middle line:84%
that we can just
plug into as well.

01:00:05.474 --> 01:00:06.390 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Absolutely.

01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:07.190 align:middle line:90%
And it was great.

01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:middle line:84%
When you find out somebody
else's happy song,

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.270 align:middle line:90%
then it becomes your happy song.

01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:12.070 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

01:00:12.070 --> 01:00:14.100 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: So it's a
community thing too

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:16.679 align:middle line:90%
that we can all share as well.

01:00:16.679 --> 01:00:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Like I like "Kung Fu
Fighting" a lot more since--

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:18.890 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:19.690 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:22.355 align:middle line:84%
We all need to find out
our sweetie's happy song.

01:00:22.355 --> 01:00:23.750 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Exactly.

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:25.960 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: We have just
a couple minutes left.

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Any final comments on maybe some
of the work and experimentation

01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:32.560 align:middle line:84%
going on right now, more
in the science arena,

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:35.540 align:middle line:84%
or just in what's coming
up with you and your music?

01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:36.340 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Yeah.

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:37.140 align:middle line:90%
Well, both.

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Where I think we can really
move forward in this field

01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:43.590 align:middle line:84%
is getting more specific
in our research.

01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think we
tend to lump things

01:00:45.550 --> 01:00:49.750 align:middle line:84%
into genres-- classical
music or rock music.

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:51.250 align:middle line:84%
How many millions
of songs are there

01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:53.050 align:middle line:90%
in each of those categories?

01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:55.350 align:middle line:84%
So what my focus
is is let's begin

01:00:55.350 --> 01:00:57.600 align:middle line:90%
to focus on designer music.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:01.280 align:middle line:84%
This specific piece
has this frequency,

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.370 align:middle line:90%
and let's see if it works.

01:01:03.370 --> 01:01:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Because we need more information
on what frequency works

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:08.440 align:middle line:84%
to move beyond urban
legend that's out there,

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:13.100 align:middle line:84%
and let's see what really
works in quantitative studies.

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And then within my work,
I'm excited to announce

01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:21.270 align:middle line:84%
that I'm releasing a
series for pets and humans

01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:23.430 align:middle line:84%
to bond with together,
because I think animals--

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:24.160 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Oh, interesting.

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:24.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.280 align:middle line:90%
They're very sensitive to music.

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.695 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: Yes, and to us.

01:01:27.695 --> 01:01:28.040 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Us.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:28.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:30.173 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: So creating
a program where

01:01:30.173 --> 01:01:31.969 align:middle line:90%
we connect with our animals.

01:01:31.969 --> 01:01:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And HeartMath has done
some initial studies

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:36.820 align:middle line:84%
showing that when we're in that
space where we're connecting

01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:39.020 align:middle line:84%
with our animals, that
actually, our heart rate

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:42.440 align:middle line:84%
variabilities move into a
space of coherence together.

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:43.240 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:45.880 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: So this is
going to be a series that

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:50.250 align:middle line:84%
works with us listening,
taking time with our pets,

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:51.610 align:middle line:90%
winding down.

01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:52.960 align:middle line:90%
They feel our energy.

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:55.060 align:middle line:84%
We feel their
unconditional love.

01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And I composed it initially
for our dog, Woody,

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:03.800 align:middle line:84%
who we saved from
the Humane Society,

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:08.780 align:middle line:84%
and has been an instrumental
part as my teacher.

01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:10.150 align:middle line:90%
Pets teach us patience, right?

01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.950 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:13.930 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: So that's where I'm
going and lots of new projects

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:17.520 align:middle line:84%
with great speakers and
supporting their work.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.780 align:middle line:84%
As you told me off
camera, this is the year

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:21.080 align:middle line:90%
of collaboration and synergy.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:21.954 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: That's right.

01:02:21.954 --> 01:02:24.310 align:middle line:84%
GOLDSTEIN: So I'm synergizing
with Gregg Braden, Anita

01:02:24.310 --> 01:02:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Moorjani.

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:26.604 align:middle line:10%
We're doing some
great things together.

01:02:26.604 --> 01:02:30.640 align:middle line:10%
With Dr. Joe Dispenza, who I
just have so much gratitude

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.370 align:middle line:10%
for our collaborations
and his work

01:02:33.370 --> 01:02:35.730 align:middle line:10%
that I've been part of sharing.

01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:37.540 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: That's wonderful.

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:40.951 align:middle line:84%
Write down the
pieces to purr by.

01:02:40.951 --> 01:02:41.950 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: That's right.

01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Purrfect music.

01:02:42.770 --> 01:02:45.020 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Purrfect music.

01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:45.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:46.963 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: You're welcome.

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:48.970 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: I really--
I mean, like I said,

01:02:48.970 --> 01:02:50.890 align:middle line:84%
I can't do a day
without music, and I'm

01:02:50.890 --> 01:02:53.454 align:middle line:84%
so happy to have your
inspiration for people

01:02:53.454 --> 01:02:55.870 align:middle line:84%
who may have kind of let music
drop from their lives a bit

01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:58.759 align:middle line:84%
to pick it back up again,
start the healing process.

01:02:58.759 --> 01:02:59.800 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Barry.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:00.758 align:middle line:90%
GOLDSTEIN: My pleasure.

01:03:00.758 --> 01:03:01.962 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

01:03:01.962 --> 01:03:03.670 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: As I said at
the top of the show,

01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't live without
music in my life

01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:07.210 align:middle line:84%
and love what Barry
has shared with us.

01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:10.160 align:middle line:10%
You can pick up a copy of "The
Secret Language of the Heart"

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.470 align:middle line:10%
through major booksellers.

01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:15.130 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you
for joining us here on Gaia.

01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:21.430 align:middle line:90%
