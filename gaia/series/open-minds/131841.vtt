>>REGINA MEREDITH: I don't
think there is one among us who

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.830 align:middle line:10%
is not subconsciously affected
by painful experiences

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:33.930 align:middle line:10%
of the past.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.250 align:middle line:84%
For many, these deep
feelings have cut us off

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.170 align:middle line:84%
from the very
things we long for.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Then we go through
an entire life

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.810 align:middle line:84%
without digging down to
discover the source of the pain.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Robert Bleck has
been taking people back

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.900 align:middle line:84%
to the source of
pain for decades,

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and he's here with his
salient observations

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.480 align:middle line:84%
after decades of
doing this work.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.679 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
us here from New York.

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:54.762 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBERT BLECK: Thank you.

00:00:54.762 --> 00:00:55.566 align:middle line:90%
Nice to be here.

00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.890 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: First of all, you
do Source Completion Therapy,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.530 align:middle line:84%
and I think maybe
let's just start out

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.100 align:middle line:90%
first with what that means.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.556 align:middle line:84%
And then we can start filling
in the rest of the story.

00:01:05.556 --> 00:01:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Sure, it's a
therapy that I created.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.970 align:middle line:10%
And it's basically a
three-phase therapeutic process

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.210 align:middle line:10%
that's designed to deep cleanse
and heal emotional wounds.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
in your book you

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.640 align:middle line:84%
put a lot of-- which I
love, I like anecdotes.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.180 align:middle line:84%
I want to see examples of where
that particular event trapped

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.615 align:middle line:84%
a particular individual
in, you know,

00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:32.170 align:middle line:84%
a limitation, a very
limiting pattern,

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.587 align:middle line:84%
sometimes even
destructive patterns.

00:01:34.587 --> 00:01:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And you do a really good
job of illustrating this.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, you're
a really good writer.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: Thank you.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.550 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
have you thought

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.394 align:middle line:90%
of just writing for a living?

00:01:43.394 --> 00:01:45.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: I've thought about
it, writing other books,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.710 align:middle line:84%
but it was so exhausting
to write this.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.800 align:middle line:90%
It was painful for me.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was it?

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.690 align:middle line:90%
You're such a natural.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.210 align:middle line:90%
You write beautifully.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.857 align:middle line:84%
It almost reads like a
novel in its craftsmanship.

00:01:54.857 --> 00:01:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: Well, you're very kind.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.687 align:middle line:84%
What was painful was when
I went back to the scenes

00:01:58.687 --> 00:01:59.520 align:middle line:90%
that I had created--

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I
would believe that.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.241 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: --of the people.

00:02:01.241 --> 00:02:03.660 align:middle line:84%
I felt their pain, so
it was difficult for me.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you seem
to be very empathic.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.840 align:middle line:84%
You seem like a
very sensitive man.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.510 align:middle line:84%
So why did you choose
this line of work?

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Well, that's
a good question.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.170 align:middle line:84%
It starts when I
was a little boy.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.390 align:middle line:84%
I always felt an empathy and a
sympathy for those struggling

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.300 align:middle line:84%
and in pain in life
when I was young,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.420 align:middle line:84%
but there was one incident
that actually cemented my path

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.780 align:middle line:90%
to do this.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.470 align:middle line:90%
I was on a vacation.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:84%
I was with a few
fraternity brothers,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.490 align:middle line:84%
and we decided to
go to Puerto Rico.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.400 align:middle line:90%
Were near the water.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And the beach was pristine,
and the hotel was glittering.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.750 align:middle line:84%
But I decided to take
a tour to the inland,

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.102 align:middle line:84%
and the poverty that I saw was
staggering and very painful.

00:02:48.102 --> 00:02:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And I made a commitment
that I'd like to make

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.490 align:middle line:90%
a contribution to humanity.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to continue
on in psychology

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and a few years
later get my PhD.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I was armed
with many, many theories

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.160 align:middle line:84%
and many, many techniques, but
none seemed complete enough

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.690 align:middle line:84%
for me and for the
people I was working with

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.870 align:middle line:84%
to really make permanent changes
and really heal the person.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.420 align:middle line:84%
So by trial and error and by
sequencing different aspects

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.160 align:middle line:84%
of different theories, I
came up with this sequence,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.800 align:middle line:84%
and it became known as
Source Completion Therapy.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does it
require a person

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.040 align:middle line:84%
to actually live
that past experience,

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.605 align:middle line:84%
or just to kind of tap
in and feel it again?

00:03:34.605 --> 00:03:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Or what's required
of the client?

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: OK, the first phase
in the process is awareness.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.270 align:middle line:84%
So many people, if they've
been hurt in their childhood,

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:84%
they repress the pain,
and they suppress it.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Especially children,
it's so abhorrent,

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle line:84%
what's happening to them,
they would short circuit.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So their brain as a
protective mechanism just

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.510 align:middle line:84%
represses, stuffs it down as
my people like to call it.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And what happens, in
order to get healed,

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.680 align:middle line:84%
they have to be aware
of who hurt them.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.250 align:middle line:90%
That's the first step.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.750 align:middle line:90%
So that would be the first step.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:12.690 align:middle line:90%
So who hurt them?

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.160 align:middle line:90%
What don't they want to feel?

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.270 align:middle line:90%
How were they hurt?

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.079 align:middle line:90%
Why were they hurt?

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.470 align:middle line:90%
When did it happen?

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
phase is called reliving.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.750 align:middle line:84%
For that, they do have
to go back in time,

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.920 align:middle line:84%
and I help them through
visualization, self hypnosis,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.410 align:middle line:84%
to go back to all the sights,
the sounds, the feelings,

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.520 align:middle line:84%
the smells, the
entire situation.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And that brings the
feelings up to the surface.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And then the third phase is they
confront the person who hurt

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.220 align:middle line:90%
them with effective feedback.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people don't
want to go that deep.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, I would think.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.947 align:middle line:84%
Even some of the examples
you used in the book,

00:04:53.947 --> 00:04:55.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that I'd
want to go back there.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Right, very
painful, very intense,

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.182 align:middle line:90%
this is an intense process.

00:04:59.182 --> 00:05:00.390 align:middle line:90%
Some people get scared of it.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.860 align:middle line:84%
It takes courage to do it
and courage to move on.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.810 align:middle line:84%
The more they go back, the
more cleansed they are,

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.020 align:middle line:84%
basically is what
happens because if they

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.140 align:middle line:84%
don't go back far enough,
some of it still stays in.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And it always
comes out in what I

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.860 align:middle line:84%
call in the book
these diversions,

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.361 align:middle line:84%
whether it's an
obsession, a phobia.

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:21.526 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, we're going
to talk about all the ways

00:05:21.526 --> 00:05:23.830 align:middle line:84%
in which we divert because
we all do one or the other.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: Correct.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the name of the
book is "Give Back Your Pain,"

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.890 align:middle line:84%
so it's critical that you
address it and put it back

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.420 align:middle line:90%
on the source that delivered it.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.461 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Right, it seemed
to make the most sense,

00:05:34.461 --> 00:05:36.128 align:middle line:84%
and it was the sequence
that was healing

00:05:36.128 --> 00:05:37.377 align:middle line:90%
the people I was working with.

00:05:37.377 --> 00:05:38.200 align:middle line:90%
So I was happy.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How about
your own childhood?

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Well, I had
difficulties with it,

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.480 align:middle line:90%
my mother in particular.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.820 align:middle line:84%
But I used this
process, and that

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.760 align:middle line:90%
was working for me as well.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.637 align:middle line:90%
And my people ask me that.

00:05:50.637 --> 00:05:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, did you go
through this process,

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.429 align:middle line:90%
because you tell us to do it?

00:05:53.429 --> 00:05:54.928 align:middle line:84%
And I say, absolutely,
or I wouldn't

00:05:54.928 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:90%
be telling you to do it.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK, good,
we've got that out.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Now in the book, you take
people back to their infancy.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And you've said in there that if
your needs do not go answered,

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.570 align:middle line:84%
it sets up a cascade of
negative events in our life.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And then it made me think back
to one of the advice books,

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:21.100 align:middle line:84%
I think it was from the 1950s,
maybe Dr. Spock, something

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.150 align:middle line:90%
about letting the kids cry out.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.110 align:middle line:90%
You don't soothe babies.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.120 align:middle line:84%
You let them cry it out and
learn this is a tough place,

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.900 align:middle line:90%
and they've got to get over it.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.252 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:06:32.252 --> 00:06:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: I think that is
absurd, and it's ridiculous.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's so cruel.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: It's cruel,
mean, inhuman,

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.850 align:middle line:90%
and I never did it with my son.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And if anyone asked me,
I'd say, don't do it.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:90%
The child will outgrow that.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:43.580 align:middle line:90%
You get up.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.300 align:middle line:90%
You meet his needs.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.930 align:middle line:90%
He would be fine then.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.020 align:middle line:90%
He would feel safe.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.090 align:middle line:84%
He would feel protected
He won't [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.715 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about what happens

00:06:51.715 --> 00:06:55.280 align:middle line:84%
if someone is, say, an exhausted
parent, an unskilled parent,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.620 align:middle line:84%
or they're buying that
from their grandmothers.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And they say, oh, just
let him cry it out.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.570 align:middle line:90%
He'll stop sooner or later.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.077 align:middle line:90%
What happens to our psyche?

00:07:02.077 --> 00:07:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Well, what happens
is feelings of feeling

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.700 align:middle line:84%
unsafe, unprotected,
unloved, uncared for.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.980 align:middle line:84%
They stay inside, and
they will come out later.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.150 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.910 align:middle line:84%
In all the years I've been
doing this, they will come out.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:21.960 align:middle line:84%
No matter what you try, exercise
programs, diet, relaxation

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.822 align:middle line:84%
techniques, they will come
out in some form or another.

00:07:25.822 --> 00:07:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you find this with
quite a few of your clients

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.930 align:middle line:84%
through the years, that
starting really early on,

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.250 align:middle line:84%
nobody responded to
what they needed?

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.274 align:middle line:90%
Is this a pretty common pattern?

00:07:35.274 --> 00:07:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: With the ones I
do work with, yes, not only

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.130 align:middle line:84%
didn't they respond to what they
needed, but some were beaten.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.730 align:middle line:90%
Some were sexually abused.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Some were raped by their
fathers or their step-fathers.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.060 align:middle line:90%


00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's various
ways you get abused.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Some were just
neglected totally.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, well, let's
talk about-- go ahead.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: I'm just remembering
one of the clients.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Please,
share the stories.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: He was an alcoholic.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And what happened, he
remembers-- when we went back

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:84%
into his childhood, he
actually remembered the crib

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.000 align:middle line:90%
that he was in.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.550 align:middle line:84%
It was down a
long, dark hallway.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.350 align:middle line:90%
No one came.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.660 align:middle line:84%
He could see these shadows,
his parents talking,

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:23.070 align:middle line:84%
and he remembers wishing that he
could reach the shadows to have

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.860 align:middle line:90%
some kind of comfort and love.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And nobody came, and
then he remembers

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:84%
getting up in the crib
and shaking the bars

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.289 align:middle line:84%
and just crying and crying until
he just fell asleep crying.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:37.190 align:middle line:84%
And then, years later
when he came to me,

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.830 align:middle line:84%
we brought this out,
but he was an alcoholic,

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.080 align:middle line:90%
to anesthetize that pain.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.360 align:middle line:90%
So I never tell anybody.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.910 align:middle line:90%
They ask me.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Because people who I
see, they have children.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.840 align:middle line:90%
They get married.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.511 align:middle line:84%
And, well, should
we let them cry?

00:08:51.511 --> 00:08:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Our pediatrician is
telling us to do that.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.540 align:middle line:90%
I say, never do that.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ever.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, in fact, my
son, when he was sleepy,

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.940 align:middle line:90%
he used to like to stay up.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And he used to like us to
be with him in the crib.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:84%
But we got to a point
where he was getting older,

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.120 align:middle line:84%
so we went into our
bedroom, my wife and I.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.590 align:middle line:90%
And then he was crying.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.780 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, let's put
a sleeping bag by our bed

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.370 align:middle line:84%
and let him come in
anytime he wants.

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:18.560 align:middle line:84%
So he would come in for a few
years, whenever he wanted to,

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.589 align:middle line:84%
just hold my hand as I reached
to the side, fell asleep.

00:09:21.589 --> 00:09:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And then, sure enough,
a year or two later,

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.540 align:middle line:84%
he went into his own
bed, and that was it.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I mean, there
is a natural process in there,

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:32.090 align:middle line:84%
some societies, often indigenous
societies in particular,

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:36.070 align:middle line:84%
where it's considered a crime
to let a child even sleep alone.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Until they get to
be a certain age,

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:84%
you have the company
of your parents,

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.320 align:middle line:90%
your siblings, your tribe.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.020 align:middle line:84%
You don't sleep alone with
the mysteries of the night

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.070 align:middle line:90%
surrounding you.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Correct, correct,
there is no purpose in that.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why those books
are still in existence.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't either because
of that inherent cruelty in it.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:58.939 align:middle line:84%
And with my son, it was similar,
although he didn't cry much.

00:09:58.939 --> 00:10:00.980 align:middle line:84%
By five weeks, he was
sleeping through the night.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And then he'd take a good,
long nap during the day,

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.510 align:middle line:84%
you know, two, even
three hours sometimes,

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.110 align:middle line:90%
and it was the opposite.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:09.180 align:middle line:90%
I was the irritating one.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.560 align:middle line:84%
I'd go and walk by and bump the
crib, hoping he might wake up

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.790 align:middle line:90%
so I say, hi, honey.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I was disturbing
his sleep, rather than

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.370 align:middle line:90%
him disturbing mine.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.522 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: That's funny.

00:10:22.522 --> 00:10:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, he must have felt safe
and secure with you, I'm sure.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah,
and vice versa,

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:31.030 align:middle line:84%
whenever his energy was in the
room, it was just like a tonic

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.992 align:middle line:84%
to my energy field
and vice versa.

00:10:32.992 --> 00:10:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: That's lovely.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it
was, so I didn't

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:37.100 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of that crying
through the night thing

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:37.900 align:middle line:90%
to deal with.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.450 align:middle line:84%
So I can't be judgmental
about it, you know.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:46.170 align:middle line:84%
So you call these cancers of
the past, these events that

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:48.110 align:middle line:84%
happen in our lives,
and you say they

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.991 align:middle line:84%
are as trapped in our bodies
as a physical disease.

00:10:50.991 --> 00:10:51.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: It's like that.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you
get food poisoning,

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.042 align:middle line:90%
your body wants to eliminate it.

00:10:57.042 --> 00:11:00.270 align:middle line:84%
In the case of emotions
that you store,

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.394 align:middle line:84%
also your subconscious
wants to eliminate it.

00:11:02.394 --> 00:11:03.560 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't like it in there.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.090 align:middle line:84%
It's really kind of eating us
away because it's coming out.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:09.330 align:middle line:84%
It's being pushed out
in these other things.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.990 align:middle line:84%
So they are like a cancer
because they just fester inside

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.570 align:middle line:90%
until they are released.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:14.880 align:middle line:90%
That's why I call it that.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you say
that we can't really

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:22.770 align:middle line:84%
be open to all of the magic and
all of the beauty in our lives

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:26.130 align:middle line:84%
until we've rid
ourselves of whatever

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:29.040 align:middle line:84%
these toxins, these
emotional toxins are.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Absolutely, I
say that, and I see how

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.210 align:middle line:90%
it is for the people at work.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.830 align:middle line:90%
I see how it is for myself.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, that's the truth
in my book, in my work.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So you must release
those poisons

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.200 align:middle line:84%
in order to be open to
the wonder and majesty

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.070 align:middle line:90%
that life can be.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:48.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do say that.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.783 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, but
you also have to be

00:11:49.783 --> 00:11:51.910 align:middle line:84%
able to recognize
kind of the symptoms

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.160 align:middle line:90%
of your emotional wounds.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Now we didn't bring the book
out on the table with us,

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.530 align:middle line:84%
but on page 14 it talks
about the symptoms.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us
so each one of us

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.710 align:middle line:84%
can see ourselves in
this conversation?

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Oh, sure,
there's plenty of them.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.130 align:middle line:84%
You could be feeling worthless,
inadequate, defective.

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:11.220 align:middle line:90%
You could have obsessions.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.590 align:middle line:90%
You could have phobias.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:16.050 align:middle line:84%
You could feel
afraid of commitment.

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:17.470 align:middle line:90%
You could feel withdrawn.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.740 align:middle line:84%
You could feel you have
to be a perfectionist

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.310 align:middle line:90%
to get approval in life.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and there
is a really common one

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.110 align:middle line:90%
which is fear of judgment.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: Correct.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.236 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of people
are afraid of judgment.

00:12:30.236 --> 00:12:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Right,
because in their house,

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.526 align:middle line:84%
they could have had
a father or an uncle

00:12:33.526 --> 00:12:36.840 align:middle line:84%
or a mother just judge them and
criticize them continuously.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.892 align:middle line:90%
And then they grew up that way.

00:12:38.892 --> 00:12:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm, and if
they don't do it themselves,

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.410 align:middle line:84%
they're still a slave-- I
mean, the beautiful thing

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:45.950 align:middle line:84%
about having a
chance to be a parent

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:47.866 align:middle line:84%
is that you can reverse
some of these patterns

00:12:47.866 --> 00:12:50.480 align:middle line:84%
within your own kind of
family history, your ancestral

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.280 align:middle line:90%
history.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.060 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
passed down to your child,

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't mean that you're
not still more or less a slave

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.450 align:middle line:90%
to it yourself.

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Yes, well, talking
about passing it down,

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.960 align:middle line:84%
that's what happens a lot,
unless the person goes

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.470 align:middle line:84%
into some help or
treatment or understands

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.020 align:middle line:90%
what's happening to them.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:12.530 align:middle line:84%
So most of my
clients, they thank me

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:15.350 align:middle line:84%
for saving their life and
their children's lives,

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.300 align:middle line:90%
so it is rewarding for me.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:21.216 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, just what
you wanted to do, you know.

00:13:21.216 --> 00:13:23.550 align:middle line:84%
So you talk about
the ways in which

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:28.350 align:middle line:84%
we kind of deflect attention
from our own emotions.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And one of it is through
the use of language.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was
really interesting,

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.540 align:middle line:84%
to depersonalize something
by using the word, it,

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:44.570 align:middle line:84%
or you, for example, or
everybody and people.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.440 align:middle line:84%
So I would like you
to give examples

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.340 align:middle line:84%
of what you're talking about
there, what it's actually

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.120 align:middle line:84%
covering up, and what
the person really

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.900 align:middle line:84%
is or should be saying
when they do this,

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.232 align:middle line:90%
because I think we all do it.

00:13:56.232 --> 00:13:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: Most people do, yes.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I just said, we.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I would never say,
of course, I do that.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Well, just a simple
one, you know what it's like.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Your father comes home,
and he's an alcoholic.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.410 align:middle line:90%
And everybody scatters.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.260 align:middle line:90%
No one wants to be with him.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.060 align:middle line:90%
You know it's like.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.650 align:middle line:90%
You've experienced it.

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.920 align:middle line:84%
So compare it to,
you know, I had

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.000 align:middle line:90%
a father who was an alcoholic.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And when he came
home, I was terrified.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:24.520 align:middle line:84%
I was scared, and I just
hid under my covers.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.890 align:middle line:84%
So there's a difference
in intensity and potency.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:29.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
so talk about

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.013 align:middle line:84%
that a little bit with some of
the clients you've worked with.

00:14:32.013 --> 00:14:34.650 align:middle line:84%
What happens when they
simply-- because I'm

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:38.040 align:middle line:84%
sure when they come in and first
sit down, this is their story.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: Right, yes.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When they
first start talking,

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:42.720 align:middle line:90%
maybe give us an example or two.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.840 align:middle line:10%
What happens when
you actually own it

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.460 align:middle line:10%
on a very personal level?

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Well, if it was
an example like I gave you,

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:52.350 align:middle line:84%
you know, my father,
he was cruel,

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:84%
mean, neglectful, judgemental,
never told me I was pretty,

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.154 align:middle line:90%
was absent.

00:14:59.154 --> 00:15:00.570 align:middle line:84%
What was more
important to him was

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:03.110 align:middle line:84%
the ice in the
alcoholic drink, so I

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.130 align:middle line:90%
would hear that in my head.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.130 align:middle line:84%
So personally, that's
what started it.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:07.930 align:middle line:90%
It hurt.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:10.540 align:middle line:84%
It hurt to have a
father like that.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:14.505 align:middle line:84%
It hurt, was there, a body
part, in the generic air.

00:15:14.505 --> 00:15:16.930 align:middle line:90%
I says, no, I really hurt.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And then the person
has to hear it,

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:22.060 align:middle line:84%
and then they're starting
to feel the experience

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.780 align:middle line:90%
and the pain of it.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
crucial in my therapy.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.060 align:middle line:84%
You have to feel
the pain, and that's

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.620 align:middle line:84%
what brings it to the surface
so it can be released.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's say we're
not in the therapist's office.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say we're in
a normal relationship.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's say we're even in
a marital relationship,

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.334 align:middle line:84%
or, you know, a
personal relationship

00:15:44.334 --> 00:15:45.750 align:middle line:84%
that has some kind
of depth, where

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.520 align:middle line:90%
it does trigger things in you.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.970 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that's what
you're speaking about here

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.770 align:middle line:84%
would be a very
wise practice really

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:57.050 align:middle line:84%
for anyone in a relationship
to another human being,

00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:00.250 align:middle line:84%
to just become aware
of this language issue.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Yes, it's a good
thing to do for all of us

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:07.210 align:middle line:84%
because we don't want to even
stuff feelings in the present

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:09.840 align:middle line:84%
because, again, if you stuff
these feelings in the present,

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.090 align:middle line:90%
that will fester.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So you always want
to be in touch

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:16.460 align:middle line:84%
with the feelings on the
depth and the intensity

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:17.670 align:middle line:90%
and be aware of that.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.169 align:middle line:90%
Be aware of what you're feeling.

00:16:19.169 --> 00:16:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How about kids?

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Are kids more
direct, or have they

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:25.030 align:middle line:84%
already learned to camouflage
it by their use of language?

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: It depends how hurt
they are or how safe they feel.

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:31.150 align:middle line:84%
If they are, if they
feel nurtured and loved

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:35.130 align:middle line:84%
and cared for, a lot of children
that I've seen or have worked

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.760 align:middle line:90%
with, they are OK with it.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.780 align:middle line:84%
They understand an
I. Others don't.

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And others will
suffer and do suffer.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the language
is relational to the kind

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:48.430 align:middle line:90%
of experience.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: I think so.

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:50.634 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do think that.

00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're not safe to
tell the truth, so to speak,

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:54.470 align:middle line:90%
to speak in personal terms.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: It's a protective
way of doing it, if they say,

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.800 align:middle line:90%
you, or a person, or a friend.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Also the language of I
guess, maybe, probably

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.099 align:middle line:90%
is also diversionary.

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:08.130 align:middle line:90%
It pushes the experience out.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like, I guess maybe
that wasn't the maybe best,

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.160 align:middle line:90%
you know, like that, yeah.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Yeah, versus,
well, no, when he beat me,

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.940 align:middle line:90%
I really hurt deep down.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.359 align:middle line:90%
And I felt shame.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And I withdrew, versus
I guess it hurt me.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.200 align:middle line:84%
It's really the
difference in owning that.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.669 align:middle line:90%
It's very powerful.

00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how
often do you find--

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.085 align:middle line:84%
I'm not looking for
numbers, really, but just

00:17:32.085 --> 00:17:35.390 align:middle line:84%
an experience-- that people
then somehow blame themselves

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.130 align:middle line:84%
for these things that
happened to them?

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:38.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: Oh, a lot do.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.660 align:middle line:84%
They think that they're
defective and inadequate.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
deserved it somehow?

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Some, yes,
deserved it, or they just

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.740 align:middle line:84%
felt they're inherently,
genetically defective

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:56.280 align:middle line:84%
because if I wasn't defective,
my father would have loved me.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.747 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what
I did, he didn't.

00:17:58.747 --> 00:18:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it makes
sense because as a child,

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.538 align:middle line:84%
you're automatically
putting your parents

00:18:02.538 --> 00:18:03.700 align:middle line:90%
in the superior role.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: Correct.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're right.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.690 align:middle line:90%
They're your parents.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:07.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: Correct.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if they're
doing something bad to you,

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.320 align:middle line:90%
it's your fault.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.569 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Right, that's how
they feel, and they grow up

00:18:12.569 --> 00:18:13.500 align:middle line:90%
feeling that way.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.730 align:middle line:90%
And it's hard to break that.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:19.400 align:middle line:84%
People I see, they do break it,
if they go back to the source.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.750 align:middle line:84%
But it's very painful
for them because they

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:25.760 align:middle line:84%
take that defectiveness to every
relationship that they have.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give us an
example of some of that.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.316 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have
a lot of examples

00:18:29.316 --> 00:18:32.070 align:middle line:84%
in your book of someone whose
self-worth was just so low,

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:37.010 align:middle line:84%
and then they go out and up
in kind of serial situations.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Do you have an example
you can share with us

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.330 align:middle line:90%
of how that shows itself?

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Well, someone
who feels defective,

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.180 align:middle line:84%
I can give you an example
of a person in business.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:52.550 align:middle line:84%
He felt really unloved by his
parents, especially his mother.

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:90%
She was cold and distant.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And any affection he would get,
in the form of a camera picture

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.200 align:middle line:84%
that his father had taken, she
would smile for the picture,

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.400 align:middle line:90%
but never for him afterwards.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.540 align:middle line:84%
So he was really hurt,
and he felt so unloved.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And whatever relationship
he has now, or recently,

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:17.100 align:middle line:84%
he would transfer that feeling
of defectiveness to it.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So if it was in
business, he would

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.850 align:middle line:90%
feel he's not good enough.

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:22.892 align:middle line:90%
What is he doing wrong?

00:19:22.892 --> 00:19:24.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, I can't
make this better.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:26.830 align:middle line:90%
There's something wrong with me.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And that would plague
him and hurt him deeply

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:31.590 align:middle line:90%
until he ended this process.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And we said, well,
the defectiveness

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:34.970 align:middle line:90%
you weren't born with.

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.670 align:middle line:84%
It's what your
parents made you feel.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And he does understand it now,
and he still works with me.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was this
completely hidden

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.540 align:middle line:90%
from his own self-awareness?

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.729 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: Correct, correct.

00:19:43.729 --> 00:19:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that
generally the case?

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Or do some people
come in and say,

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.940 align:middle line:84%
I know it's got to be
some issue of self-esteem?

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:50.850 align:middle line:84%
I know this used to
happen when I was young.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Do most people have an
awareness of where it came from?

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:54.670 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: It varies.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:55.840 align:middle line:90%
It's different shades.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.650 align:middle line:84%
The gentleman that I just spoke
about, he came in and told

00:19:58.650 --> 00:19:59.920 align:middle line:90%
me he had a great childhood.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.470 align:middle line:90%
His parents were terrific.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:04.090 align:middle line:90%
So that was one.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:08.050 align:middle line:84%
Another, I work now with
a young entrepreneur,

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:12.094 align:middle line:84%
and he was referred to
me by a local hospital.

00:20:12.094 --> 00:20:13.760 align:middle line:84%
He thought he was
having a heart attack.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.540 align:middle line:90%
He had pain down his arms.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.040 align:middle line:84%
His heart was beating
out his chest,

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.175 align:middle line:84%
it felt like,
throat was closing.

00:20:20.175 --> 00:20:20.975 align:middle line:90%
He was terrified.

00:20:20.975 --> 00:20:22.524 align:middle line:90%
He thought he was dying.

00:20:22.524 --> 00:20:23.940 align:middle line:84%
A hospital gave
him all the tests.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you
had a panic attack,

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:30.560 align:middle line:84%
so we're referring
you to Dr. Bleck.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.862 align:middle line:84%
So he came and saw me,
and he was terrified.

00:20:33.862 --> 00:20:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And I explained to
him what was going on,

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:37.720 align:middle line:84%
what a panic attack
basically is.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.330 align:middle line:84%
I used a glass of
water, and I said, OK.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:45.130 align:middle line:84%
What a panic attack
is, imagine the glass

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.330 align:middle line:90%
filled to the top with water.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's all the feelings that
you've stored inside for years.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.052 align:middle line:84%
Just take the stress
of everyday life.

00:20:53.052 --> 00:20:54.010 align:middle line:90%
You put a few drops in.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:55.100 align:middle line:90%
It overflows.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.530 align:middle line:84%
It's like your psyche
is in short circuit.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:59.170 align:middle line:90%
Your body is in short circuit.

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Everything is haywire,
and that's a panic attack.

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:04.850 align:middle line:84%
OK, he said, so
how do we help it?

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:08.904 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, tell me about
what's happened in your past.

00:21:08.904 --> 00:21:10.070 align:middle line:90%
What don't you want to feel?

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And he started discussing
it, and he's much better now.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And he has no more
panic attacks,

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:19.700 align:middle line:84%
and the relationships
he has in business

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:20.700 align:middle line:90%
are much better as well.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.866 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why did he feel
overwhelmed to begin with?

00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:23.120 align:middle line:90%


00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Very stressful,
the work that he does,

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.140 align:middle line:90%
his business.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:31.170 align:middle line:84%
He has a number of
businesses, and that stress,

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:35.260 align:middle line:84%
getting those extra drops,
pushed him over the list.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.060 align:middle line:90%
But it's allowed.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.870 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't even thinking
about it, you know,

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:84%
and now he's terrific
at the process.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.680 align:middle line:90%
He goes back.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.480 align:middle line:90%
He calls.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.580 align:middle line:84%
I have to source it, Doc,
meaning I have to go back

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.330 align:middle line:84%
and see where these
feelings really belong.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and in some
cases, such as, you know,

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:58.120 align:middle line:84%
a stressful business day
or events that occur,

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.640 align:middle line:84%
someone might be a little
more open to going back

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.650 align:middle line:84%
into that then incest
or something really

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:06.150 align:middle line:84%
deep and horrible
from their childhood.

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Correct, usually
when they work with me,

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:10.884 align:middle line:84%
they know they are going
to go back, you know.

00:22:10.884 --> 00:22:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they
know what you do, yeah.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: Correct.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:13.760 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:14.210 align:middle line:90%
I say that.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:15.250 align:middle line:90%
I ask them before.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:16.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, are you
aware of what I do?

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:17.670 align:middle line:90%
Most of them do.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:22.250 align:middle line:84%
They get referrals by people
that have been with me.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
the role of the clown.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.440 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:31.227 align:middle line:84%
We all know people who tend
to laugh at everything.

00:22:31.227 --> 00:22:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Everything, you know, is like
the world is one big joke,

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.310 align:middle line:84%
but there is a nervousness
that underlies the laughter.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:42.749 align:middle line:84%
So what is the hallmark
deep inside of the clown?

00:22:42.749 --> 00:22:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And I know you have a couple
of anecdotes in your book.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: I do.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's say, I talk about a
comedian I had seen years ago.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.620 align:middle line:84%
He was on that one
of the talk shows,

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:52.940 align:middle line:90%
and he was telling fat jokes.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.000 align:middle line:90%
He happened to be heavy.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's hysterical
in the audience.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:57.650 align:middle line:90%
They're laughing.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:59.520 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, the
pilot asked me to move

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.811 align:middle line:90%
to the other side of the plane.

00:23:00.811 --> 00:23:03.790 align:middle line:84%
I had to balance out the
plane to make it fly.

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And the audience is
really hysterical.

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And he had to take two seats
in the theater, you know.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.560 align:middle line:84%
So I said, I don't
think that's funny.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.050 align:middle line:90%
I think something's wrong.

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:13.990 align:middle line:90%
And sure enough--

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.156 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You talked to him.

00:23:15.156 --> 00:23:16.020 align:middle line:90%
Or did you see him?

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: I saw him
on another talk show.

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Someone was asking
him about his life.

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:23.750 align:middle line:10%
And sure enough, he said
his father was an alcoholic,

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:26.280 align:middle line:10%
and he left his family
for another woman.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And it devastated him, and
he never talked about it.

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And he used both food
and humor, comedy,

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.540 align:middle line:90%
to divert from that pain.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And that was it, so people
who use humor, laughter,

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:43.140 align:middle line:84%
when it's inappropriate, most
people are aware of that.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.530 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people do that.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A lot of people do it.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: Correct.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:47.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the Western world.

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: They do, and I
never really find it funny.

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:53.760 align:middle line:84%
They use sarcasm, which
I don't find funny.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.080 align:middle line:84%
When someone is sarcastic,
they are deflecting again

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:57.880 align:middle line:90%
their feelings.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.050 align:middle line:84%
They're focusing on
someone else's weaknesses

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:03.030 align:middle line:84%
rather than looking
inside of themselves,

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:05.219 align:middle line:84%
so that's really
what's going on.

00:24:05.219 --> 00:24:07.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some of
it is just so subtle.

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:08.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been
confused over it

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:12.470 align:middle line:84%
because I know some people
who are very capable.

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.750 align:middle line:84%
They seem very
confident in their lives

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.500 align:middle line:90%
and excellent at what they do.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:23.840 align:middle line:84%
But everything is
hidden up with a laugh.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.332 align:middle line:84%
So what is that laugh
actually saying?

00:24:27.332 --> 00:24:28.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: It's diverted.

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:30.947 align:middle line:84%
It means that they're
diverting from something.

00:24:30.947 --> 00:24:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know unless I've spoke
to them or saw something.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so it's just
another form general diversion?

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: It is.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:38.670 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:40.280 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
ways we divert.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.185 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, that's one of
the forms, criticism of others.

00:24:43.185 --> 00:24:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're
going to go there next.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that, where you have

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:49.590 align:middle line:84%
very strong patterns of
criticism, of everybody else

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:50.390 align:middle line:90%
is wrong.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:51.765 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting
next to someone

00:24:51.765 --> 00:24:54.290 align:middle line:84%
on the airplane the other
day, having at his wife.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And the pilot was
doing-- everybody

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.290 align:middle line:90%
was wrong in his world.

00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh, gosh,
that must be painful.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Right, right,
so this person is really

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:03.990 align:middle line:90%
hurting inside.

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:07.440 align:middle line:84%
So he focuses on everybody
else and criticizes them

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.940 align:middle line:84%
so he doesn't have to look
internally and feel that pain.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:12.540 align:middle line:90%
So that's what that is.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Rage,
because people, you

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.390 align:middle line:84%
know-- I tend to know people
who have worked on themselves.

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:24.000 align:middle line:84%
They've tried to figure
out the essence of life

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.120 align:middle line:84%
and their place in
it and so forth.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.860 align:middle line:84%
But still, something
happens and boom.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.050 align:middle line:84%
You see this rage come
pouring out of them,

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:35.060 align:middle line:90%
roaring out of them, and--

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: It's scary, isn't it?

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I saw it
last weekend in someone,

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.770 align:middle line:90%
and I was absolutely shocked.

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:44.710 align:middle line:84%
I was witnessed happening
from one person to another.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.470 align:middle line:90%
I thought, oh, my God.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:47.270 align:middle line:90%
What's under there?

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:48.350 align:middle line:90%
Where does it come from?

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.600 align:middle line:84%
I live in kind of a
new-age community,

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.720 align:middle line:84%
so that makes it all
the more shocking

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.610 align:middle line:84%
because you don't
behave like that, right?

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:57.690 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about rage.

00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:59.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Well,
again, it's a person

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.000 align:middle line:84%
who has been abused or damaged
or betrayed in some way.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Again, they stuff that feeling
down, and it's in there.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.110 align:middle line:90%
OK, it's in there.

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:09.990 align:middle line:84%
I have an example in the
book of a rage experience

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:11.900 align:middle line:84%
that I had on the Long
Island Expressway.

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:12.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm from New York.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, tell us about it.

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:16.578 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Yeah, sometimes it
looks like a parking lot,

00:26:16.578 --> 00:26:17.780 align:middle line:90%
it's get so crowded.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And one day, I was with my
wife, and we were driving.

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was bumper to
bumper-- actually, stopped.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.070 align:middle line:90%
The traffic was stopped.

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking in the mirror
because I hear honking.

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:28.507 align:middle line:90%
And it's a pickup truck.

00:26:28.507 --> 00:26:30.590 align:middle line:84%
A gentleman in a pickup
truck is honking the horn.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:31.320 align:middle line:90%
There was no way to go.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:31.790 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't go to the right.

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:33.022 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't go to the left.

00:26:33.022 --> 00:26:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a parking lot.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Correct, so there's
totally nowhere to go,

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:40.360 align:middle line:90%
and I'm uncomfortable, you know.

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.040 align:middle line:90%
It's getting a little scary.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, we start to
move-- because his hand was

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:46.270 align:middle line:90%
on the horn.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:48.670 align:middle line:84%
His hand was on the horn,
and I went like this.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.830 align:middle line:90%
So he pulls around finally.

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:53.230 align:middle line:84%
We start to move, maybe
three miles an hour.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And he pulls up to me
and starts cursing at me,

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.065 align:middle line:90%
saying, learn how to drive.

00:26:58.065 --> 00:26:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going
to say the curses.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't, I'll
get out of the car,

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:03.390 align:middle line:90%
and I'll slap your face.

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:08.390 align:middle line:84%
So what I know from what I do
is that he's not seeing me.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:11.200 align:middle line:84%
He's enraged at
someone else, anger

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.590 align:middle line:84%
that he has stored for
most of his life, probably.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a way of
deflecting it onto me.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.430 align:middle line:84%
So I do know that,
but it is scary

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:21.530 align:middle line:90%
when you see that in real life.

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
everybody experiences it,

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:26.410 align:middle line:84%
either in themselves
or in someone else,

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:28.990 align:middle line:84%
especially on the road because
here you're driving along.

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:31.520 align:middle line:84%
You consider anyone
else an impediment,

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.360 align:middle line:90%
and they're anonymous.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.300 align:middle line:84%
So this seems to be a place
for particularly bad behavior.

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: It is.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.308 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You wouldn't do
it in a grocery store line,

00:27:39.308 --> 00:27:42.020 align:middle line:84%
right to someone's face, but you
can't see their face, you know,

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:47.020 align:middle line:84%
especially if you're behind them
and you're moving at a pace.

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And that anonymity
seems to embolden

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.210 align:middle line:90%
people to behave even worse.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:53.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: It does.

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:53.950 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Even though when you don't
have the anonymity, like,

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.270 align:middle line:90%
I've seen people get rageful.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:03.260 align:middle line:84%
I have my coffee in the
morning at a local diner.

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And at times, I see
people get angry, furious,

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:11.000 align:middle line:84%
at the waiter or waitress
for some minor infraction.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that
anonymous there,

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.670 align:middle line:84%
but they're protected
by one serving them.

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:18.740 align:middle line:84%
So they think they can
bully the other person.

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's say
you're on the road, you know,

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:24.490 align:middle line:84%
or in a diner and you have
a slow waiter or something.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:27.132 align:middle line:84%
And you feel that blood
rising up inside yourself,

00:28:27.132 --> 00:28:28.340 align:middle line:90%
and you're getting impatient.

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:31.720 align:middle line:90%
And you're like, come on.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:32.710 align:middle line:90%
What do you suggest?

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Because I think most people
go through that experience.

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:39.840 align:middle line:84%
That means most people have
rage at some place buried

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.902 align:middle line:90%
inside themselves.

00:28:40.902 --> 00:28:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: I would agree.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do you recommend
the average person confront

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:46.480 align:middle line:90%
rage in themselves?

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.210 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not all going
to go to the therapist or even

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:48.980 align:middle line:90%
read the book.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:50.563 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: No, well,
it's really simple,

00:28:50.563 --> 00:28:53.870 align:middle line:84%
if they want to really know
the answer to that question.

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:56.825 align:middle line:84%
What I tell people is,
just ask yourself, well,

00:28:56.825 --> 00:28:58.660 align:middle line:90%
what don't I want to feel?

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:01.950 align:middle line:90%
And who really made me rageful?

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:05.387 align:middle line:84%
And what feelings have I been
storing for all those years?

00:29:05.387 --> 00:29:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's it.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.270 align:middle line:84%
A couple questions
and pretty much boom.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:10.040 align:middle line:84%
When the who comes
up, you see it.

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: Who caused the rage?

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.220 align:middle line:90%
Who made you this angry?

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.770 align:middle line:90%
It can't be me.

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:17.160 align:middle line:84%
You don't really
know me that well.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.670 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't have caused this.

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else in
your life hurt you

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.415 align:middle line:90%
or betrayed you in some way.

00:29:22.415 --> 00:29:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you get a lot
of anger directed at you

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:26.120 align:middle line:90%
during your therapy sessions?

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.159 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: At first, when my
clients first start coming--

00:29:29.159 --> 00:29:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You start
hitting the soft spots.

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:34.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Yes, and I had
to make a rule, actually.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.907 align:middle line:84%
Before they actually
start the therapy,

00:29:36.907 --> 00:29:38.990 align:middle line:84%
I say, you're not allowed
to throw anything at me,

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:40.570 align:middle line:84%
because you might
get angry at me.

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:43.496 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, you
can't punch me.

00:29:43.496 --> 00:29:44.430 align:middle line:90%
You can't kick me.

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:46.740 align:middle line:84%
OK, physical harm to
me is not allowed.

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:49.150 align:middle line:84%
I have to say that actually
because what happens

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:52.830 align:middle line:84%
is when I start
probing them, they'll

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:55.480 align:middle line:84%
get so angry at the
questions because they

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.770 align:middle line:90%
don't want to touch this.

00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:59.010 align:middle line:90%
So that's one source of anger.

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:01.744 align:middle line:84%
And the other is
all of a sudden,

00:30:01.744 --> 00:30:03.410 align:middle line:84%
they think I'm the
person who hurt them.

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:06.310 align:middle line:84%
They'll transfer that
anger because I'm a man.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was a man that hurt them,
their father or their husband.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.810 align:middle line:90%
So that comes out in two ways.

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:13.230 align:middle line:90%
So I had to cushion myself.

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:16.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For a
sensitive guy, yeah,

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.300 align:middle line:90%
you do have to cushion yourself.

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.216 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: I had to cushion
myself in many ways.

00:30:20.216 --> 00:30:22.990 align:middle line:84%
But the ones I have met for
years that work with me,

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:24.630 align:middle line:90%
they're not at that level.

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:26.177 align:middle line:90%
So they understand that.

00:30:26.177 --> 00:30:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And I just ask the question,
oh, who is this from?

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.580 align:middle line:90%
It's from my father, you know.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
OK, done with that,

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.430 align:middle line:84%
OK, so no anger, the
subject of anger,

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:36.110 align:middle line:84%
because most
everybody has it, you

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:42.330 align:middle line:84%
say you need to learn to discern
between diversionary anger

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:47.039 align:middle line:84%
and genuine or justified
anger in some way.

00:30:47.039 --> 00:30:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that a little bit,

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:53.470 align:middle line:84%
because I'm sure people
can be confused over this?

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Diversionary anger
would be the rageful kind,

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.292 align:middle line:90%
you know, that just comes up.

00:30:58.292 --> 00:30:59.250 align:middle line:90%
It has really no place.

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.240 align:middle line:90%
It's inappropriate.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:04.310 align:middle line:84%
But I could be angry with
you if you promised me

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:06.480 align:middle line:84%
you'd meet me somewhere,
you didn't show up,

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.040 align:middle line:90%
and I was waiting an hour.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.255 align:middle line:90%
So I would be disappointed.

00:31:09.255 --> 00:31:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And I would be angry,
and I would be annoyed.

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And that would be
appropriate feelings.

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:18.130 align:middle line:84%
But if I was so rageful that
I grabbed you or hurt you

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:20.540 align:middle line:84%
in some way, that would
be really inappropriate.

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.950 align:middle line:84%
So that would be diversionary
because that infraction is not

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:27.190 align:middle line:84%
enough to cause hurting
you in some way.

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:28.605 align:middle line:90%
So that's the difference.

00:31:28.605 --> 00:31:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and you
say entire nations

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.620 align:middle line:84%
go through these diversionary
practices with anger

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:37.590 align:middle line:84%
and violence and that
wars even are often

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:40.874 align:middle line:90%
a diversionary tactic at large.

00:31:40.874 --> 00:31:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Yes, the
example in my book-- I

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.040 align:middle line:84%
mean, the whole
world is doing that.

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:47.134 align:middle line:84%
I mean, tons of
countries do that now.

00:31:47.134 --> 00:31:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Create a war here.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.549 align:middle line:84%
Oh, what's going on over
there where no one's looking?

00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Correct, the one in the
book, I mean, it's so powerful.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Germany, after World War
I, they were depressed.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:57.640 align:middle line:90%
They were starving.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.400 align:middle line:84%
They felt humiliated by
the European countries.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:04.140 align:middle line:90%


00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:07.000 align:middle line:84%
They built up their armed
forces, and they used war.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.110 align:middle line:84%
They went to war with
England and Poland

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:12.740 align:middle line:84%
as a diversion for
those feelings.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of Humiliation.

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Correct,
humiliation was there also.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And then they started going
after races of people--

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:21.210 align:middle line:90%
the Jews, blacks.

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:23.026 align:middle line:90%
They went after religions.

00:32:23.026 --> 00:32:25.025 align:middle line:84%
The Bolsheviks, I believe,
they went after, too.

00:32:25.025 --> 00:32:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And people who
were gay and practicing,

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:29.914 align:middle line:90%
Gypsies, other lifestyles.

00:32:29.914 --> 00:32:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Correct,
everyone who they felt

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.880 align:middle line:84%
was different than them,
they went after them.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.650 align:middle line:84%
In the concentration camps, they
murdered millions and millions

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:40.729 align:middle line:84%
in the name of a
diversion, basically

00:32:40.729 --> 00:32:43.270 align:middle line:84%
for not wanting to look at their
country, look at themselves.

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's
that say about the US

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:46.828 align:middle line:84%
and what we're doing and
have been doing for decades?

00:32:46.828 --> 00:32:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Right, so
that's the same thing.

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:54.980 align:middle line:84%
We divert our own problems,
economic or political, social,

00:32:54.980 --> 00:33:00.230 align:middle line:84%
and we give the people
a war to divert from it.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I mean, we
have major problems right now,

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.620 align:middle line:84%
economically, serious
problems in the trenches.

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:09.267 align:middle line:84%
And all we hear on the
nightly news is about war.

00:33:09.267 --> 00:33:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Correct,
so it's just, again,

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:14.260 align:middle line:84%
a diversion to keep us away,
from looking at ways that we

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.500 align:middle line:90%
need to deal with it.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Even if those ways
are painful, maybe we

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:21.600 align:middle line:84%
have to cut here, cut
there, and do what's right.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And obsessions and
compulsions, that's a big one.

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.140 align:middle line:90%
That's a big diversion.

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:27.070 align:middle line:90%
They can look healthy.

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:28.528 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some people
would say, wow.

00:33:28.528 --> 00:33:30.682 align:middle line:84%
That guy, he's
really good at that.

00:33:30.682 --> 00:33:32.890 align:middle line:84%
He's a little obsessed, but
he's really good at that.

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:35.524 align:middle line:84%
But often underneath of it
is something else, right?

00:33:35.524 --> 00:33:36.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Right,
well, one person I

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:39.300 align:middle line:84%
had had a number of
compulsions and obsessions.

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.090 align:middle line:90%
I'll go through that.

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.890 align:middle line:90%
It was a woman.

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:45.640 align:middle line:90%
I started seeing her in her 30s.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:49.680 align:middle line:84%
She would have a cigarette
in her hand or mouth

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.390 align:middle line:84%
at the time, a drink
in the other hand,

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:54.290 align:middle line:90%
and she would love to gamble.

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:55.750 align:middle line:90%
So she had that.

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And she'd take about five
showers a day, to keep clean.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.153 align:middle line:90%
She was obsessed with that.

00:34:00.153 --> 00:34:06.810 align:middle line:90%


00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:07.730 align:middle line:90%
She was functioning.

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:10.840 align:middle line:84%
She was going to school and
taking care of the family.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.460 align:middle line:84%
One day, when she was
washing one of her sons,

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.889 align:middle line:90%
he got annoyed with something.

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:19.929 align:middle line:84%
And she started to
choke him in the shower.

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:24.010 align:middle line:84%
So she came to me
and said, you know,

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:26.239 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to hurt my babies.

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:27.690 align:middle line:90%
Help me, please.

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So we had to go back and look
at where these came from,

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.840 align:middle line:84%
all these obsessions
and phobias.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:36.870 align:middle line:84%
They served the purpose of
her not dealing with the pain

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:41.840 align:middle line:84%
from an alcoholic father who
was judgmental and critical and

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.540 align:middle line:84%
abusive, who would
beat her brother.

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:48.830 align:middle line:84%
She would hear the slaps and
the screams from her brother.

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:52.320 align:middle line:84%
So all of that,
she'd just push down

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:56.236 align:middle line:84%
with drinking and
smoking, gambling.

00:34:56.236 --> 00:34:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She hit them all.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Correct,
she had them all.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's an example of
a number of them there.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And there was one
person who was obsessed

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.820 align:middle line:90%
with her physical health.

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:13.330 align:middle line:84%
Any scratch, any
cough, any indigestion,

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:15.130 align:middle line:84%
anything, she would
think she was going

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:17.217 align:middle line:84%
to be brought to the
hospital, would be hooked up

00:35:17.217 --> 00:35:18.800 align:middle line:84%
to all the machines,
and all she would

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.915 align:middle line:84%
hear was the beeps, the
buzzes, and she would be dying,

00:35:20.915 --> 00:35:21.830 align:middle line:90%
deteriorating.

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:22.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For everything.

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:23.283 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: Everything.

00:35:23.283 --> 00:35:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you
would call that almost

00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:28.270 align:middle line:90%
like an extreme hypochondriac.

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:31.650 align:middle line:84%
But, in fact, yeah,
I remember reading

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:33.945 align:middle line:84%
about that in the book,
the extremes in her mind

00:35:33.945 --> 00:35:37.220 align:middle line:84%
that she went to for just a
tiny, like you say, a scratch.

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:38.820 align:middle line:90%
She's dying.

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a life-threatening
infection that's

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:42.016 align:middle line:90%
going to get into your wound.

00:35:42.016 --> 00:35:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Right, how
she came to see me,

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:48.050 align:middle line:84%
she discovered a lump under
her ear, and she panicked.

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:50.650 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't function anymore.

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:52.870 align:middle line:84%
When they can't function
anymore, a lot of people

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:54.140 align:middle line:90%
come in to me.

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:57.180 align:middle line:90%
So it really goes into extremes.

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:58.560 align:middle line:84%
She thought it
was cancer, so she

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.577 align:middle line:84%
went to the doctor,
a number of doctors.

00:36:00.577 --> 00:36:01.910 align:middle line:90%
And they all told her it wasn't.

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And they said it
was a lymph node.

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:06.230 align:middle line:84%
She didn't believe
them, so she got

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:09.230 align:middle line:84%
obsessed with poring
over the medical journals

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:10.890 align:middle line:90%
and researching it.

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And finally, they gave her all
the tests that she asked for.

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.850 align:middle line:90%
It was OK.

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And then she coughed, and
then she went on to pneumonia.

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:21.420 align:middle line:84%
She thought she had pneumonia,
so it was a constant.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So sad.

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Yes, very
sad, tormented.

00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tormented, yes,
what about the notion

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:30.030 align:middle line:84%
of the connection
between-- this is

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:33.190 align:middle line:84%
one we hear about commonly--
but your experience of it,

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:39.230 align:middle line:84%
sexual abuse and overeating
for women in particular?

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:40.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: Yes, it is common.

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:42.420 align:middle line:84%
They use that as a
diversion, you know,

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.090 align:middle line:90%
and then they'll obsess.

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:47.870 align:middle line:90%
That becomes an obsession also.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:51.240 align:middle line:84%
They'll hate themselves after
they overeat, or binge eat,

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.300 align:middle line:90%
I call it.

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And they are out of
control with eating,

00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:59.840 align:middle line:84%
and it's very tormenting,
very torturous.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.230 align:middle line:90%
So they're tortured in two ways.

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:04.740 align:middle line:84%
They're tortured by what was
done to them in the past,

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:09.180 align:middle line:84%
and then the obsession of
the food is also torturous.

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:11.520 align:middle line:84%
So they're just
really in misery.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about the type
of brain chemicals involved

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:18.540 align:middle line:84%
with being raped or molested,
especially as a child,

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:22.850 align:middle line:84%
and then the crossover to
eating, because a lot of time

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:25.660 align:middle line:84%
it's usually carbohydrates
and that kind of thing?

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: OK, I'm not
that familiar with that.

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:31.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm familiar with the serotonin
levels and norepinephrine

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:32.310 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:33.780 align:middle line:84%
What happens in
there, any really

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:37.430 align:middle line:84%
stress that's
happening to a person,

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:39.640 align:middle line:84%
serotonin and
norepinephrine basically

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:43.060 align:middle line:84%
are our body's
natural tranquilizers.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:46.170 align:middle line:84%
We go to sleep without
taking a pill, most of us.

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:50.460 align:middle line:84%
But when you're experiencing
such trauma and such stress

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:53.320 align:middle line:84%
at such high,
emotionally-intense levels,

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.510 align:middle line:84%
your serotonin levels and
norepinephrine levels,

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:56.310 align:middle line:90%
they drop.

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:59.360 align:middle line:90%


00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.540 align:middle line:84%
With a lot of people, they
experience that with me.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:04.240 align:middle line:84%
I work with a psychiatrist
who I refer to.

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.740 align:middle line:84%
He gets their levels
up, and then we

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:07.749 align:middle line:84%
can go through my
therapy, my process.

00:38:07.749 --> 00:38:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they have
to have that intact

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.498 align:middle line:84%
beforehand because it
could be too destructive?

00:38:11.498 --> 00:38:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Correct, they could
get clinically depressed then.

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And then they don't
go out of the house,

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.295 align:middle line:84%
and they just want
to kill themselves.

00:38:20.295 --> 00:38:22.250 align:middle line:90%
Like, they're suicidal.

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So the psychiatrist, he
knows that I refer to him,

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:28.370 align:middle line:84%
and he'll get them
on the medication.

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:30.374 align:middle line:84%
That helps them start
to function again.

00:38:30.374 --> 00:38:31.790 align:middle line:84%
But then I said,
well, then now we

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:34.280 align:middle line:84%
have to go back because
once they start functioning,

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.602 align:middle line:90%
we go back to heal them.

00:38:36.602 --> 00:38:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
think that would be

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:40.480 align:middle line:84%
some of the more painful
type of experiences.

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say,
about 20 years ago

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:45.870 align:middle line:84%
I became aware, on
a personal level,

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:47.920 align:middle line:84%
of friends, friends
and even a couple

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.990 align:middle line:84%
of kind of distant
family members,

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:53.730 align:middle line:90%
how prevalent sexual abuse was.

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:55.860 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:56.890 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty common.

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: Yes, it's very common.

00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:59.300 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot in my book.

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:02.860 align:middle line:84%
If you've read it,
it's all over, yes.

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if it's not in
your family, you tend to think,

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:13.070 align:middle line:84%
oh, well this is just some kind
of extreme example of someone

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:14.910 align:middle line:90%
whose dad went berserk.

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:16.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's certainly
not in the norm.

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:18.860 align:middle line:90%
But that's not a fair statement.

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:23.700 align:middle line:84%
It's been prevalent throughout
history, across all cultures,

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:25.980 align:middle line:90%
across classes.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:29.630 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't seem to be just--

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: It is.

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:32.080 align:middle line:84%
It is prevalent, and
it's heartbreaking

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.760 align:middle line:90%
because it continues.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And it depresses me
just to know that.

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:43.050 align:middle line:84%
I do the best I can to heal,
but it's a very sad commentary

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:45.156 align:middle line:90%
on society.

00:39:45.156 --> 00:39:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm, and there
are a lot of other implications

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:50.250 align:middle line:84%
if you want to go
metaphysical on it, too.

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: And, again, it can
happen in any household,

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:53.820 align:middle line:90%
like you were saying.

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to give
you another example where

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:58.080 align:middle line:84%
the household had
seemed on the outside,

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.880 align:middle line:84%
everybody, oh, they
had a lovely family.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.630 align:middle line:84%
The mother was a
professional, the father.

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:04.360 align:middle line:90%


00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.150 align:middle line:84%
The woman that I'm
going to talk about,

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:08.930 align:middle line:84%
she came to me, also
in her late 30s,

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:12.580 align:middle line:84%
with a number of symptoms,
a lot of withdrawal,

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:16.480 align:middle line:84%
difficulty in commitment
to relationships.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And what we uncovered
was that when

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:21.770 align:middle line:84%
she was about four
years old, her father

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:24.670 align:middle line:84%
would come into her bed
each night and make her rub

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:28.050 align:middle line:90%
him in the genital area.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And she really
deposited that down

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.960 align:middle line:84%
and stuffed it and repressed
that down very, very deeply.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So tell us
more about that woman.

00:40:36.540 --> 00:40:40.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Yes, so he would
make this little girl

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:41.960 align:middle line:90%
rub him each night.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And she, you know, is
depressed, all these feelings.

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And what she did
as she grew older

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:50.700 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that
they were repressed,

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:52.780 align:middle line:90%
she used what's called numbing.

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:54.700 align:middle line:90%
It's another diversion.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.250 align:middle line:84%
She numbed herself
so much physically

00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and emotionally that she
would go to a mirror.

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And she would look in the mirror
and take a knife or a scalpel,

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:08.430 align:middle line:84%
and she would cut her
cheeks to make sure she

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:11.020 align:middle line:90%
couldn't feel any pain.

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And when she knew she
wasn't feeling any pain,

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.540 align:middle line:84%
she felt great
because she says, I'm

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.630 align:middle line:90%
still not able to feel any pain.

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: So that's
really, really powerful.

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.003 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did she
have scars all over?

00:41:21.003 --> 00:41:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: I didn't see them.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.280 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see them.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:25.196 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She must have
just done little cuts,

00:41:25.196 --> 00:41:26.290 align:middle line:90%
and they healed OK.

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:29.460 align:middle line:84%
But still, to think that a
person has to go that far just

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.690 align:middle line:84%
to prove they can't
feel something horrible

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:32.750 align:middle line:90%
that was perpetrated.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Correct, and that's
a powerful example of that.

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was
another situation

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.430 align:middle line:84%
about transference
and projection

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.990 align:middle line:84%
in your book which
is pretty common.

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was about
a man named Kenny

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:47.270 align:middle line:84%
who had had early
bed-wetting experiences.

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:49.320 align:middle line:90%
He ended up hating all women.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.165 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about Kenny and what
happened with him, sensitive,

00:41:52.165 --> 00:41:53.000 align:middle line:90%
little guy.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: He was
sensitive, very sensitive.

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, he was wetting his
bed, and he was older.

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:01.080 align:middle line:90%
He was four or five or six.

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And his mother had
no patience, and she

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:06.980 align:middle line:84%
thought by humiliating
him, it would

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.720 align:middle line:84%
get him to change that, it
would get him to stop wetting.

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:16.470 align:middle line:84%
So what she would do in the
morning when he went to school,

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:19.020 align:middle line:84%
she would hang his
sheets out of the window

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.220 align:middle line:84%
so when his classmates
would walk by,

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:24.380 align:middle line:90%
they would see what he has done.

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And so little Kenny felt
humiliated and shamed and maybe

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.550 align:middle line:84%
something, again, defective,
like something was wrong with.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.110 align:middle line:84%
So he transferred
all those feelings

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:37.100 align:middle line:84%
onto every woman,
women teachers.

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:40.220 align:middle line:84%
He thought that they were
going to hurt him in some way.

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Women that he would try to
have some relationships with,

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:46.260 align:middle line:90%
he was mistrustful always.

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:48.926 align:middle line:90%
So it was very sad.

00:42:48.926 --> 00:42:51.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that poor guy, it

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.630 align:middle line:84%
sounds like he had one
relationship after another

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:56.050 align:middle line:84%
and just always
ended up transferring

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:57.010 align:middle line:90%
that hatred on them.

00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Correct, and
fear, it was hatred

00:42:58.870 --> 00:43:01.620 align:middle line:90%
and fear and humiliation.

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:04.930 align:middle line:84%
He felt that they were
going to humiliate him.

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:06.300 align:middle line:90%
And, well, he came to me.

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:10.200 align:middle line:84%
We worked it through, and
he ended a relationship.

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's fine.

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and in your
book, you give these examples.

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And you also have, like,
the self scripting.

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:23.720 align:middle line:84%
For a person to help themselves
go through this recognition

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:27.480 align:middle line:84%
process in areas that they
have been extremely limited in,

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.220 align:middle line:84%
or their joy, or their
productivity in life

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:31.790 align:middle line:84%
has been limited,
it's almost always

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:34.180 align:middle line:84%
from something of
the past, right?

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:35.265 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: Yes.

00:43:35.265 --> 00:43:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your
intention, I assume,

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:38.930 align:middle line:84%
was to allow people--
not everybody is going

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:40.680 align:middle line:84%
to be able to fly to
New York and do this,

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:43.980 align:middle line:84%
right-- was to allow people
to take this on on their own.

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Yes, that's why
I did write this book.

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:49.070 align:middle line:84%
I wanted the public
to understand

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:52.520 align:middle line:84%
the mechanisms for their
pain and their diversions

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.240 align:middle line:90%
and their symptoms.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to do it in a clear
way because a lot of the books

00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:59.270 align:middle line:84%
I read, even when I
was going to school,

00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:01.550 align:middle line:84%
seemed kind of
convoluted and not clear.

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:05.505 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to give the lay
person a chance at healing.

00:44:05.505 --> 00:44:07.380 align:middle line:84%
So that was the purpose
of writing this book.

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and as I
said, you did a beautiful job.

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:15.160 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm saying, write
some fantasy or fiction.

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.010 align:middle line:84%
You're just such
a beautiful writer

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:19.120 align:middle line:84%
that it makes it a
breeze to go through,

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:23.230 align:middle line:84%
although some of the anecdotes,
of course, are quite painful.

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:29.620 align:middle line:84%
One area that we
don't have enough time

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:31.950 align:middle line:84%
to go into with
a lot of depth is

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:33.930 align:middle line:84%
the notion of dreams
and then also working

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:35.310 align:middle line:90%
with your dream time.

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And so from your
therapeutic point of view,

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:40.020 align:middle line:90%
what does that look like?

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Well, what I
like to have a person do

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:49.040 align:middle line:84%
with their dreams is every
person or thing in the dream

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:51.700 align:middle line:90%
represents a part of themselves.

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So that's how I like to help
them interpret the dream.

00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you'd like me to
go through one of those--

00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, do.

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: OK, one of the ones
in the book that I particularly

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:04.980 align:middle line:84%
like, this gentleman
saw himself up

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:07.140 align:middle line:84%
at the top of a roller
coaster on a hill.

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:08.270 align:middle line:90%
He was on the tracks.

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:10.980 align:middle line:84%
He was straddling the tracks,
but he was on top of it.

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And on the sides of
the tracks, going up,

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:15.420 align:middle line:90%
were different people.

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And at the very bottom was
this rageful man with a spear.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:25.420 align:middle line:84%
So this person, watching
a person with a spear,

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:27.492 align:middle line:84%
he would spear each
person on the tracks

00:45:27.492 --> 00:45:28.700 align:middle line:90%
and throw them over the side.

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Jeez,
what an awful dream.

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Right, and everyone,
he would spear all of them.

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.090 align:middle line:90%
And he knew the-- my person.

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [INAUDIBLE]
sooner or later.

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Correct, he knew that
this person's coming for me.

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:43.470 align:middle line:90%
So that was the dream.

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, so tell me
about that each person is you.

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:48.420 align:middle line:90%
What's that about?

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So he says, well,
the people that

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:53.910 align:middle line:84%
are getting murdered are the
parts of me that were destroyed

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and killed, my mother destroying
the innocence and pure part

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.480 align:middle line:90%
of me by how she treated me.

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Then my teachers
and some girlfriends

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:06.500 align:middle line:84%
I have are parts of that
were creative and fun loving

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:07.300 align:middle line:90%
and enjoyed--

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:08.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're all skewered.

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Skewered and
thrown over, and he said,

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and even the man himself is
a rageful part of me that

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:18.970 align:middle line:90%
feels rage about what happened.

00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:21.160 align:middle line:90%
And I understand that.

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And the man wore a plaid
jacket, so, he says,

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:27.310 align:middle line:84%
the checks in there are like
the crossroads of my life,

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:30.490 align:middle line:84%
that I was so angry I
missed opportunities

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:34.300 align:middle line:84%
with relationships and
careers that I blew.

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:37.700 align:middle line:84%
So that's how he interpreted
that and he understood it.

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:38.730 align:middle line:90%
And he went back--

00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a lot
of insight, though.

00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Well, I guided
a little bit in terms

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:44.640 align:middle line:90%
of what person is this?

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:45.440 align:middle line:90%
Who is he?

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so it's there
if someone asks the question.

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:49.688 align:middle line:84%
You just wouldn't maybe think
to ask the question yourself.

00:46:49.688 --> 00:46:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Correct,
in the book, they

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:54.970 align:middle line:84%
get an idea in their other
dreams that they can see.

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:57.650 align:middle line:84%
If you just remember
every person is you,

00:46:57.650 --> 00:47:00.130 align:middle line:84%
all you have to ask is the
question, what part of me

00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:02.397 align:middle line:90%
is that?

00:47:02.397 --> 00:47:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it always, always
starts making more sense.

00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:06.060 align:middle line:90%
Well, I told you.

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Before the cameras
started rolling,

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:10.790 align:middle line:84%
we were sitting here,
doing mic checks and such,

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:15.725 align:middle line:84%
and I said, well, I had a good
one a couple nights ago of ants

00:47:15.725 --> 00:47:18.822 align:middle line:84%
stuffing a mattress
with blackberries.

00:47:18.822 --> 00:47:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And you said, well,
now what do you

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.950 align:middle line:90%
think that-- I haven't a clue.

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:23.910 align:middle line:84%
But then anyway,
after that, then it

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:25.940 align:middle line:84%
triggered just a memory
of something else,

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:27.580 align:middle line:90%
more from childhood.

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And I always wondered
about it because it

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:32.710 align:middle line:84%
wasn't for many years that I
actually even questioned it.

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:36.140 align:middle line:84%
But this particular dream,
which was a repetitive dream,

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:38.660 align:middle line:84%
started at about maybe
age four or five,

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:42.400 align:middle line:84%
in which this huge, black
spider-- I'm afraid of spiders.

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Black spider, it was
a room-sized spider

00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:47.600 align:middle line:84%
would be in the
room, and I noted

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:51.320 align:middle line:84%
that all of the people outside,
my family, everybody else,

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.490 align:middle line:90%
was dead.

00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:54.780 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't see them, but
I knew they were dead.

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'm standing there, cornered
by this huge black spider.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And the spider just
telepathically said to me,

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:03.760 align:middle line:90%
you will not be harmed.

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And for years, I thought
the spider had actually

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:07.592 align:middle line:90%
killed everybody.

00:48:07.592 --> 00:48:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have any
evidence of that.

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:10.590 align:middle line:84%
It was just an
assumption because I

00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:12.450 align:middle line:90%
was afraid of the spider.

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:14.970 align:middle line:84%
But, in fact, they're
saying you're safe.

00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:16.190 align:middle line:90%
You will not be harmed.

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:18.490 align:middle line:90%
I never did make sense of that.

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:21.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and I still
haven't, except that it

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:24.650 align:middle line:84%
seems as though is was
an early kind of message

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:26.730 align:middle line:90%
that you're being protected.

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:27.980 align:middle line:90%
You have protection, you know?

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:31.575 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Yes, and I think it
was a part of you saying that,

00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:33.900 align:middle line:84%
that you were going to
take care of yourself.

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:35.910 align:middle line:84%
You knew how to do it,
and you would be OK.

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and that's one
of those childhood dreams that

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.310 align:middle line:90%
seems one thing, terrifying.

00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:41.832 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they killed everyone.

00:48:41.832 --> 00:48:44.040 align:middle line:84%
No, not necessarily, I don't
know why they were dead.

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I never saw their
bodies or anything.

00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Right, it could be a
comforting thing in a sense.

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, it could have
been a comforting thing,

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.291 align:middle line:84%
even though it's the one
thing you're really afraid of.

00:48:51.291 --> 00:48:53.900 align:middle line:84%
So that diving a little
deeper, even into something

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.860 align:middle line:84%
like that, it just kind
of popped out of nowhere.

00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:57.660 align:middle line:90%
I thought, hey.

00:48:57.660 --> 00:48:59.870 align:middle line:84%
I just remembered a
dream from my childhood.

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And those repetitious
dreams are usually there

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.650 align:middle line:84%
to reinforce or teach
us something, right?

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Correct, the
subconscious is talking to us.

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's trying to get
up to the conscious

00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:13.550 align:middle line:84%
in your mind, whether
it's pain or whatever

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:14.819 align:middle line:90%
it wants you to feel.

00:49:14.819 --> 00:49:16.360 align:middle line:84%
So we just have to
piece it together,

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:18.510 align:middle line:84%
like an archaeologist
kind of, and one way

00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:21.120 align:middle line:84%
that I do it is with
each part is you.

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I think that's
a good way to go about it.

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a beginning place to
start making sense of it.

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:31.342 align:middle line:84%
So any final thoughts
on what we, as people,

00:49:31.342 --> 00:49:32.800 align:middle line:84%
can-- because I
don't think there's

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.341 align:middle line:84%
a family that doesn't have some
dysfunctional-- I don't think

00:49:35.341 --> 00:49:37.010 align:middle line:84%
there's a person
that doesn't have

00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:40.400 align:middle line:84%
some dysfunctional behavior
that we have stuffed down.

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:43.340 align:middle line:84%
What is it going to take for
us to just first acknowledge it

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:44.250 align:middle line:90%
even?

00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Well, you don't want
to go through life that way

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:49.930 align:middle line:84%
because you're
limiting yourself.

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:51.920 align:middle line:84%
So what you want to
do, you want to get

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:54.540 align:middle line:84%
to the source of
the pain, what's

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:56.720 align:middle line:90%
happening, with the symptom.

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.080 align:middle line:84%
You want to relive
it, and then you

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:02.420 align:middle line:84%
want to confront the
source that caused that.

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:06.110 align:middle line:10%
And then if you do all that,
then all those feelings

00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:08.100 align:middle line:10%
are released, and
then you can really

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:10.980 align:middle line:10%
be open to the magic and
the wonder that is life.

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:12.170 align:middle line:90%
And I do believe that.

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And is that
how it went for you?

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BLECK: It did.

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:15.614 align:middle line:90%
It was, yes.

00:50:15.614 --> 00:50:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very good, well,
thank you so much for your time

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:19.350 align:middle line:90%
and for writing the book.

00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'd seriously consider
writing something.

00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:23.350 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to write
about depressing topics,

00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:24.350 align:middle line:90%
but use those skills.

00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:25.766 align:middle line:84%
>>BLECK: Well,
you're really kind.

00:50:25.766 --> 00:50:27.380 align:middle line:84%
I thank you for
your graciousness.

00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm sure all of
us saw bits of ourselves

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:30.956 align:middle line:84%
in these stories
and realized what

00:50:30.956 --> 00:50:34.480 align:middle line:84%
a shame it is to be held hostage
to our own personal history.

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, this is the
start of self-recognition.

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:39.910 align:middle line:10%
Again, the name of the book
is "Give Back the Pain."

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:42.710 align:middle line:10%
until next time, thank you
for joining us here on Gaia.
