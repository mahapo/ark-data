00:00:17.572 --> 00:00:19.530 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Doris
Cohen has been hacking

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.200 align:middle line:10%
into people's subconscious
minds for decades

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.600 align:middle line:10%
and has found patterns
to our dreams.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.940 align:middle line:10%
Her mission has been to
decode them and reflect them

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.710 align:middle line:10%
back to us through her book
"Dreaming on Both Sides

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.510 align:middle line:10%
of the Brain."

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.647 align:middle line:10%
And I'm looking forward to
this conversation because--

00:00:32.647 --> 00:00:33.447 align:middle line:10%
>>DORIS COHEN: Yes.

00:00:33.447 --> 00:00:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --you also used
to do regression work.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Mm-hmm.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I love
regression work.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.390 align:middle line:90%
I love dreams.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And everybody watching this
has experienced certainly

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.299 align:middle line:84%
dream time, but even a lot of
regression time in some cases.

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:47.340 align:middle line:84%
So this is just something
where people can really

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.180 align:middle line:84%
find themselves or see
themselves in your story.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
let's hear your story

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.770 align:middle line:84%
and how you were inspired to go
into these areas to begin with.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Oh, I
have a long story,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.304 align:middle line:84%
because I've been
around for a while.

00:01:00.304 --> 00:01:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you can
give us the thumbnail.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.300 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: I will.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm a clinical psychologist.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.360 align:middle line:10%
And I started out as a regular
psychotherapist consultant.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.250 align:middle line:84%
I've done everything
in psychology,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.510 align:middle line:90%
but it was never enough.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.230 align:middle line:10%
I always felt that
something is missing

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.200 align:middle line:10%
in terms of really getting into
the nitty gritty and the depth

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.030 align:middle line:10%
with patients.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.890 align:middle line:10%
So I started looking into past
lives after reading a book.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was like [GASPING],,
like Aladdin going over

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:90%
to the mountain.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which book?

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: "You Have
Been Here Before."

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.240 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.406 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: And it was amazing.

00:01:34.406 --> 00:01:37.260 align:middle line:90%
She wrote this book in the 19--

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260 align:middle line:90%
maybe the late '60s in fact.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.790 align:middle line:90%
It was fascinating.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I had to
remain under the radar

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.220 align:middle line:90%
as a psychologist.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Because I'm
very ethical and proper,

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.400 align:middle line:84%
but you couldn't go
around and say I'm

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.980 align:middle line:84%
doing past life regressions
because your license would

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.930 align:middle line:90%
be at risk.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: At any rate, so
that was the door opener.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.400 align:middle line:90%
And I began to communicate.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was very spontaneous with
guides and angels of the light.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And they have inspired
me and taught me.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:84%
May I call you by
your first name?

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes, of course.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Regina.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Regina, they have inspired
me to understand human beings

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.370 align:middle line:84%
and what really goes
on way beyond any PhD

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:84%
level of psychology that I
acquired in all my training

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.990 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And that was the beginning,
doing the past life regressions

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.390 align:middle line:84%
and helping people realize
that whatever they are going

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.270 align:middle line:84%
through, this is not the
first or only time that they

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.500 align:middle line:90%
live here.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.170 align:middle line:90%
We have been here so many times.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.384 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure that if
you've done regressions,

00:02:39.384 --> 00:02:40.550 align:middle line:90%
you know who Edgar Cayce is.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Uh!

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.750 align:middle line:84%
This man, may his
soul rest in peace.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.860 align:middle line:90%
He literally saved my life.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.660 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I used to be
terrified of dying.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Because I grew up in an
observant home, not orthodox,

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.530 align:middle line:90%
observant.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.404 align:middle line:84%
And I always used to think,
OK, I have to be a good girl.

00:02:59.404 --> 00:03:01.320 align:middle line:84%
I better be a good girl,
because there will be

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.780 align:middle line:90%
a time of reckoning at the end.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.000 align:middle line:90%
And what if I miss by a point?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.153 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And does that mean
that God would banish me?

00:03:08.153 --> 00:03:09.319 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What would happen?

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, what would happen if
you miss by a point, right?

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Exactly.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And once I read the stuff
about Edgar Cayce, it's OK.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like taking an
incomplete in college.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.414 align:middle line:84%
You know, you come back,
and you do it over again.

00:03:20.414 --> 00:03:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And this time,
hopefully, you'll fix it.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.250 align:middle line:84%
You'll probably mess
up something else.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.810 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime,
you can always fix it.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And that was-- it literally
pulled the charge out--

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.070 align:middle line:84%
the plug out of the wall
of any fears about death.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm not afraid anymore at all.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Which is going to
be my next book, by the way,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.360 align:middle line:90%
but this is for another time.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:90%
Now, how did I get into dreams?

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.650 align:middle line:84%
As a psychologist, you work
on dreams with your patients.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And one day I'm sitting
with my patients

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.380 align:middle line:90%
and I hear a voice in my head.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't hear voices.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.075 align:middle line:84%
And we were working on a dream,
and it was very constipated.

00:04:00.075 --> 00:04:01.850 align:middle line:90%
We were uh-uh.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.010 align:middle line:84%
We were not really moving
or getting very far at all.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.490 align:middle line:84%
I hear a voice in
my head saying,

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.640 align:middle line:90%
why don't you try it this way?

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.390 align:middle line:84%
So I can operate on two,
three different channels

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.210 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.180 align:middle line:84%
I've trained myself to
do that over the years.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: When I asked,
are you from the light?

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.730 align:middle line:84%
Silently asked, because if
I would have told my patient

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.575 align:middle line:84%
she would have probably said,
who should sit here, me or you?

00:04:23.575 --> 00:04:24.375 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:28.170 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: You know, because
if I'm hearing voices,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.360 align:middle line:90%
what's going on with my head?

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.780 align:middle line:84%
The long and the short of it is
after she left, I said prayers.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.630 align:middle line:90%
And it was a male voice.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.740 align:middle line:90%
He gave me his name.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I will be with
you anytime you work on dreams.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.260 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.880 align:middle line:84%
I have come to help
you with dreams.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.392 align:middle line:84%
It's been the most
amazing journey.

00:04:48.392 --> 00:04:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I'm sure.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: I have learned
about dreams beyond anything

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.240 align:middle line:84%
that I ever learned
psychologically,

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.850 align:middle line:90%
professionally, academically.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And what is wonderful is it
resonated so much with who I am

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.260 align:middle line:90%
and what I want to do.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Whatever I do, I want
it to be practical.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.700 align:middle line:84%
I want to give the tools to
my patients or my clients.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.900 align:middle line:90%
And you go do it on your own.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.230 align:middle line:90%
You don't need me anymore.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.270 align:middle line:84%
It's very nice to have
therapists for a while,

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.520 align:middle line:90%
but go, go and share the light.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.680 align:middle line:84%
So he taught me what to do and
how to give those tools simply,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.190 align:middle line:84%
easily, and yet
profoundly effectively.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.810 align:middle line:90%
So that's how I got into it.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:38.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
just for a moment--

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.370 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was there a crossing
point where after learning

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.550 align:middle line:84%
about the value of regression
work-- well, a couple things--

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.390 align:middle line:84%
did you have to kind of
backdoor it with your clients

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.516 align:middle line:84%
on the regression and
not necessarily say

00:05:53.516 --> 00:05:54.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing a past
life regression,

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.080 align:middle line:84%
but let's just go back
and see where you end up?

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Did you have to do it like that
or did you straight up tell

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.935 align:middle line:90%
them, this is what we're up to?

00:06:00.935 --> 00:06:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: No, I did not
straight up tell them.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my first
experience with a patient

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.910 align:middle line:84%
was someone who was
straight as an arrow.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Kind of-- and
this is not a judgment.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.170 align:middle line:90%
He was very kind of square.

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.178 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: And very left brain.

00:06:15.178 --> 00:06:16.490 align:middle line:90%
He worked in a bank.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.800 align:middle line:90%
He was very proper.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And we did all
the behavior therapy.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And he got a little better,
but it still wasn't working.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it
was a sexual problem.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.727 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me ask you a question
before you go any further.

00:06:29.727 --> 00:06:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, at this point when
you determined that,

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.500 align:middle line:90%
did another voice?

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: No.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or did one of
your beings speak to you

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.486 align:middle line:84%
and say, you need to
kind of go this way

00:06:36.486 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:84%
or did you just know at this
point, we're going there?

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Over the
years I have learned

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.480 align:middle line:84%
to trust inner guidance and
guides and angels of the light

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.590 align:middle line:90%
very much so.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.070 align:middle line:84%
So I very often-- but when
I say I heard the voice,

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.880 align:middle line:90%
that was my dream guide.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.060 align:middle line:90%
It was so distinct, Regina.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.242 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It was like I'm
hearing you across the table.

00:06:58.242 --> 00:06:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I understand.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: But the others, when
they communicate with me,

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.640 align:middle line:84%
it's not like you and
I are sitting in a room

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.660 align:middle line:90%
and we are interacting.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It's not
quite like that.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's more subtle,
in a sense, maybe of knowing.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you just know
to go a certain direction.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.660 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Exactly.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this man,
so now you're seeing him.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: So I said
to him, listen,

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.870 align:middle line:90%
we've tried everything else.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to try
something that's not intrusive?

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.670 align:middle line:84%
It might seem a
little different.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:24.740 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.200 align:middle line:90%
So he said, OK, fine.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.290 align:middle line:90%
I will.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.090 align:middle line:90%
We did.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:90%
We accessed the past life.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And the story is
fascinating, because if we

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.489 align:middle line:90%
get into the story--

00:07:34.489 --> 00:07:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love these stories.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.505 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:07:36.505 --> 00:07:36.760 align:middle line:90%
We've got a little time.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.560 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: OK.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.850 align:middle line:84%
He had trouble
maintaining an erection.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And he was married,
divorced, and now he

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.800 align:middle line:84%
had a girlfriend that he loved
very much, but he was really--

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, struggled.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:47.856 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Up you know
what kind of street

00:07:47.856 --> 00:07:51.350 align:middle line:84%
he was struggling, because
he wanted to be with her,

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.870 align:middle line:90%
and he kept losing his erection.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.030 align:middle line:84%
So we did the
behavior modification,

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.000 align:middle line:90%
the breathing, the imagery.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he
got a little better.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.964 align:middle line:84%
Still not able to
really maintain it.

00:08:03.964 --> 00:08:05.630 align:middle line:84%
So when we did the
past life regression,

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.660 align:middle line:84%
it turns out what
happened is he had

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.620 align:middle line:90%
been living in the mountains.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.450 align:middle line:90%
He was a young man.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:15.590 align:middle line:84%
I think it may have been maybe
Oregon or Washington state.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And he goes down to
some kind of village.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And he goes to the
Saturday night dance.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:21.950 align:middle line:90%
He meets a young woman.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.690 align:middle line:84%
They fall madly in
love with each other.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:90%
He takes her up to his cabin.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.720 align:middle line:90%
They get married.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.190 align:middle line:84%
In love with each
other, everything

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.260 align:middle line:84%
is wonderful, wonderful,
wonderful, right?

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.360 align:middle line:90%
She gets pregnant.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And then she's getting ready
to deliver, but remember,

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.010 align:middle line:84%
he lived in a cabin
in the mountains

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.700 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of nowhere.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.360 align:middle line:84%
So she was having a
very difficult time

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.260 align:middle line:84%
with the delivery and
died giving birth.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.700 align:middle line:90%
He was devastated.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.300 align:middle line:84%
He gave the child to his
family, because there

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.550 align:middle line:84%
was no way he was going
to take care of the child.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.508 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:08:53.508 --> 00:08:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It was too painful
a reminder of her loss.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.080 align:middle line:90%
And he felt so guilty.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.210 align:middle line:84%
If I had not impregnated her,
she would still be alive.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And he becomes alcoholic,
and then remains alone

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:09.930 align:middle line:90%
in the cabin.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And after-- I don't
know-- maybe three or four

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.170 align:middle line:84%
years of just drinking,
he drank himself to death.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:19.130 align:middle line:84%
So it was a miserable,
unhappy, unhappy life.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.299 align:middle line:84%
And when there has been
this kind of trauma,

00:09:21.299 --> 00:09:23.840 align:middle line:84%
this unfinished business, like
we were saying earlier about--

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: You have an
incomplete in college.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.070 align:middle line:90%
He needed to come and fix it.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:29.510 align:middle line:90%
So here he is.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.330 align:middle line:84%
His sexual behavior
is incomplete.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Also, each time, when
does he lose the erection?

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.270 align:middle line:90%
Just when he is really excited--

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: --and ready to
have an orgasm, he stops,

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:47.140 align:middle line:84%
because if he has
an orgasm, he will--

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.370 align:middle line:84%
the probability of impregnating
this woman is there.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And unconsciously--
oh, my God, oh, my

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.650 align:middle line:84%
God, am I going to
kill another woman?

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:56.360 align:middle line:90%
Because that was his conclusion.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so of course
I had to disabuse him

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.420 align:middle line:90%
of that association.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.170 align:middle line:90%
And once he went through this--

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.010 align:middle line:84%
and it was only about two or
three sessions at the most--

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.040 align:middle line:90%
he was so relieved.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And then about three weeks
later he came back and he said,

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.290 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Cohen--

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:23.540 align:middle line:90%
at the time, it was not Cohen.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.370 align:middle line:90%
It was Eltawil.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.710 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Eltawil, I have to tell you.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:29.570 align:middle line:90%
I thank you.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:31.280 align:middle line:90%
My girlfriend thanks you.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And even my mother thanks
you, because she knows I'm not

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.370 align:middle line:90%
unhappy like that anymore.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.450 align:middle line:90%
And he was fine.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, regression
work is so powerful.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm a big fan of it.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I've been into loads
of my own past lives--

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:44.873 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: That's lovely.

00:10:44.873 --> 00:10:46.998 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and assisted
others, because I think it

00:10:46.998 --> 00:10:49.370 align:middle line:84%
has such incredible
value if you just know

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.040 align:middle line:90%
where the boogie man came from.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can talk
about that later.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.230 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, you don't
want to go through the trauma

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:58.310 align:middle line:90%
of something per se.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.850 align:middle line:90%
And there are--

00:10:58.850 --> 00:10:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Of course not.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.399 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:01.945 align:middle line:84%
So there are these
defining kind of--

00:11:01.945 --> 00:11:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Yeah,
but you don't have

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.036 align:middle line:84%
the person go through the
trauma and stay in it.

00:11:05.036 --> 00:11:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:06.510 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Because as a therapist,
I had a bag of tricks,

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.410 align:middle line:90%
so to say, a lot of tools.

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.160 align:middle line:90%
So I could relax the guy.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.710 align:middle line:84%
I could have him do some
breathing, relaxation, calming.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.890 align:middle line:90%
And he trusted me.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:22.230 align:middle line:90%
By then he really trusted me.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.497 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And that's the
safest place to open up--

00:11:25.497 --> 00:11:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: --and take
those risks, you see?

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And because I've acquired
a lot of experience--

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.830 align:middle line:84%
I started working with
children and adjudicated

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.530 align:middle line:84%
dependent and
delinquent children.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And I have always said, we
need to start working always--

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:84%
as psychologists, let's start
working first with children

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.380 align:middle line:84%
so we understand, how
do we eventually develop

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.480 align:middle line:90%
into such neurotic adults?

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.070 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: If you go
straight to the adults,

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:54.650 align:middle line:90%
you never fully understand.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:55.865 align:middle line:90%
You really don't.

00:11:55.865 --> 00:11:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because we're
talking about dreams,

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.460 align:middle line:84%
maybe what we'll do
is we'll get into kind

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.100 align:middle line:84%
of some of the definitions
of types of dreams here.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.457 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll play and talk
about dreams themselves.

00:12:06.457 --> 00:12:07.290 align:middle line:90%
I'll share a couple.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:08.100 align:middle line:90%
You share some.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.130 align:middle line:90%
And we'll just have fun.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: OK.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People can
jump in, and say, oh, I

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:12.410 align:middle line:90%
had that happen once.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's go
into the types of dreams.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And let's start with
precognitive dreams.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.709 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Before we even
start, what is a dream?

00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:20.791 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What is a dream?

00:12:20.791 --> 00:12:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: People think that--

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:25.820 align:middle line:84%
do you know how often I
hear, no, I don't dream?

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.230 align:middle line:90%
They will say, I don't dream.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.630 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:28.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't dream.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:29.630 align:middle line:90%
That's not correct.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.670 align:middle line:90%
Research has been done in labs.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Every single person has
between five to eight dreams

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:39.410 align:middle line:84%
a night, unless they're taking
medication, antidepressants,

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:44.750 align:middle line:84%
anti-anxiety, or
they're taking drugs.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:46.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, cocaine,
heroin, and so on.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.940 align:middle line:90%
It dampens the experience.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.200 align:middle line:90%
We all dream.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.230 align:middle line:84%
We just don't know how
to recall the dreams.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.750 align:middle line:84%
So your question was
about precognitive dreams,

00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:00.710 align:middle line:84%
because most people think, oh,
I had a dream that my father was

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.240 align:middle line:90%
in a car accident.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.720 align:middle line:90%
And he died in the dream.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.520 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.320 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean that my
father's going to die?

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And I am just picking
up on it, because we

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:13.610 align:middle line:84%
had a fight a month
ago and we are still

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.470 align:middle line:90%
on the outs with each other.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And I always reassure them,
and say, no, no, no, no.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:21.920 align:middle line:84%
The language of dreams,
don't take dreams literally.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:29.330 align:middle line:84%
This is not a defense
in a courthouse.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Every word has to
be accounted for.

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:34.070 align:middle line:84%
You have to be very
rational and justified.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:37.670 align:middle line:84%
The language of dreams, it's
like learning a new language.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.740 align:middle line:90%
I speak four languages.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And the language of
dreams is yet another one.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, 95% of the population
don't know that language, which

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.580 align:middle line:90%
is the language of symbols.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.080 align:middle line:84%
It's the language
of the unconscious.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.160 align:middle line:84%
So when you're dreaming about
the dream I was telling you.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.010 align:middle line:84%
I dreamed my father was
in this car accident.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:13:59.350 align:middle line:90%
He died.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:03.950 align:middle line:84%
What does my father represent
in my life symbolically?

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:08.960 align:middle line:84%
That's the language of symbols
of the unconscious, you see?

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.910 align:middle line:90%
And what is-- if he died--

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, the
dreamer is always

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.070 align:middle line:90%
dreaming about the dreamer.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:19.790 align:middle line:84%
So Regina is always dreaming
about Regina, not about

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.785 align:middle line:84%
her producers, her director,
her mother, her father,

00:14:22.785 --> 00:14:26.060 align:middle line:90%
her sweetie, her beloved.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Whomever appears in your
dreams is really whatever

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.239 align:middle line:90%
they represent in your life.

00:14:32.239 --> 00:14:33.530 align:middle line:90%
You're not dreaming about them.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:35.970 align:middle line:90%
You're dreaming about Regina.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So if I dream my father was
in that car accident and died,

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm dreaming about Doris.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.572 align:middle line:84%
I'm not dreaming about
my father, you see?

00:14:44.572 --> 00:14:47.150 align:middle line:90%
And death is only an ending.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.280 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily
physical death.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.460 align:middle line:84%
So per chance maybe the
message from my unconscious

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:58.040 align:middle line:84%
is that the impact that
my father had in my life

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.530 align:middle line:90%
may be coming to an end.

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:01.410 align:middle line:90%
That's what death is.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.761 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It's the end of
the life force, you see?

00:15:03.761 --> 00:15:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I do.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah.

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:07.460 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
OK, I've got to--

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.230 align:middle line:84%
I've been looking
forward to asking this,

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:13.010 align:middle line:84%
because I find there
are distinctly--

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:16.120 align:middle line:84%
not just these, but distinctly
different experiences

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.950 align:middle line:84%
within a dream, like within a
cognitive dream, for example.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If I'm just having
a normal dream in which I'm

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.304 align:middle line:84%
kind of noticing that
there's something

00:15:23.304 --> 00:15:24.950 align:middle line:84%
that might be happening
in the future,

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:26.510 align:middle line:90%
that seems to be one thing.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.240 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, I'll
have a very specific one

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.280 align:middle line:90%
where the voice comes in--

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.920 align:middle line:84%
that's different-- when I'm
told something in a dream.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's literal,
and that does happen.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.100 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: May I ask what--

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.380 align:middle line:90%
just pick any example.

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So one example, I was in a
dream, and all of a sudden,

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:46.670 align:middle line:90%
I was pouring--

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:49.790 align:middle line:84%
I was pulling into what
looked like a big box store,

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:52.820 align:middle line:84%
like a Costco or something,
but everything went white.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.647 align:middle line:84%
And the side of the
building-- instead

00:15:54.647 --> 00:15:57.230 align:middle line:84%
of going to the parking lot, the
side of the building came up.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:58.550 align:middle line:90%
It was all white.

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And I go to turn my car engine
off to go into the store,

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and boom, it turns itself back
on after I've taken the key out

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.910 align:middle line:90%
and the radio speaks to me.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And then that male voice,
which talks to me sometimes--

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: OK.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --comes
through, and says,

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.380 align:middle line:84%
we know you've been through
a great deal of loss,

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.270 align:middle line:90%
but there is more to come.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.127 align:middle line:84%
Understand we will be there
with you when this occurs.

00:16:20.127 --> 00:16:20.960 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: How lovely.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I had just
lost my mother, right?

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I thought,
oh, my God, is it my father?

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:26.740 align:middle line:90%
Is it my son?

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.610 align:middle line:84%
They were going in a helicopter
over Yosemite the next day.

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:34.730 align:middle line:84%
I canceled my son's trip, but
it was my surrogate mother

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.110 align:middle line:90%
and one of my best friends.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And she did die exactly
the same way my mother did

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.440 align:middle line:90%
within five days of the dream.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Wow.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in fact, she died
a day or two after the dream.

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.710 align:middle line:90%
I didn't find out for five days.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:48.230 align:middle line:84%
So in that case,
they were saying,

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:49.400 align:middle line:90%
this is going to happen.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.200 align:middle line:90%
Be calm.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.420 align:middle line:90%
We'll be with you.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
a literal message

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.420 align:middle line:90%
from other beings or myself.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: No.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.304 align:middle line:90%
It's very much of a guide.

00:16:59.304 --> 00:17:00.928 align:middle line:84%
It sounds very
definitely like a guide.

00:17:00.928 --> 00:17:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would
take it as a guide.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.540 align:middle line:90%
We have guides.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.599 align:middle line:90%
We have guides.

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:08.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's a difference
between guides and angels.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:09.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not the same.

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:13.520 align:middle line:84%
But rather than going into the
distinction between the two,

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.150 align:middle line:84%
they both offer
guiding information.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And they can come in in dream
time or not, or whenever time.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: However, they
came to reassure you,

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.180 align:middle line:84%
to support you, because they
can see the bigger picture.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: In the unconscious,
it's like going into a stadium.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.107 align:middle line:90%
Everything is out in the open.

00:17:32.107 --> 00:17:34.190 align:middle line:84%
So they can see the past,
the present, the future.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: But they're not
giving you a prediction.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.830 align:middle line:84%
They're giving you support,
because they could see

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:41.130 align:middle line:90%
something is going to happen.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:41.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: You didn't know.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.120 align:middle line:90%
You were afraid.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.895 align:middle line:84%
And you pulled back, but they
were so reassuring of you.

00:17:47.895 --> 00:17:48.695 align:middle line:90%
How wonderful.

00:17:48.695 --> 00:17:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
beautiful, because it

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.000 align:middle line:90%
was a very difficult year.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.490 align:middle line:90%
And then right after that--

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:54.230 align:middle line:84%
literally two
months after that--

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.460 align:middle line:90%
then my grandmother died.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Good Lord.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.864 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then I lost my job,
because that contract ended.

00:17:58.864 --> 00:17:59.780 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't renew.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.613 align:middle line:84%
And it's on the front
page of the newspaper,

00:18:01.613 --> 00:18:03.930 align:middle line:90%
because I was in television.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:07.130 align:middle line:84%
We were in a down economy at the
time, and then I got a divorce.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:08.670 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, it goes on and on.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:09.770 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: A lot of deaths.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:10.853 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A lot of deaths.

00:18:10.853 --> 00:18:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And they were saying
in the early phases

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.110 align:middle line:84%
that we're always
there with you.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.068 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: How wonderful.

00:18:16.068 --> 00:18:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so in that sense,
it wasn't a precognitive dream.

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Although, it would appear
to us when we have those

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:22.520 align:middle line:90%
that might be.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.330 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: There you go.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:23.585 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:23.585 --> 00:18:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It wasn't really
a precognitive dream.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: No, it wasn't.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And when we think
it's precognitive,

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:32.860 align:middle line:84%
this touches on a
very delicate theme.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.400 align:middle line:84%
They say at the
time of creation,

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.290 align:middle line:84%
God created individual
sparks of light.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:39.650 align:middle line:90%
And each spark is a sword.

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.020 align:middle line:84%
This is kabbalistic
Jewish mysticism.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.540 align:middle line:84%
But mysticism is very
comparable in all religions,

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:45.770 align:middle line:90%
so it doesn't matter.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.603 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The spark of
life, the soul, yeah.

00:18:47.603 --> 00:18:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And gave
each soul the gift

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:52.040 align:middle line:84%
of free choice,
which we exercise

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.400 align:middle line:84%
consciously and
unconsciously all the time.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.280 align:middle line:84%
So when they were
offering you this support,

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.910 align:middle line:84%
they were not telling you
what was going to happen.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.270 align:middle line:84%
They could see it, because
they are on the other side.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:08.600 align:middle line:84%
But the support was
wonderful, because no matter

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.880 align:middle line:84%
what, there was always going
to be support and loving

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.680 align:middle line:90%
light for you.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: But when there are
that many deaths and endings,

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.600 align:middle line:84%
that's a lot of
challenges, Regina.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.750 align:middle line:90%
It was a tough year.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.340 align:middle line:90%
I was just numb.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.960 align:middle line:90%
It was a year of numbness.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.056 align:middle line:84%
But I only say that because
some people may say, yeah,

00:19:27.056 --> 00:19:28.430 align:middle line:84%
but I did have a
dream like that,

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.330 align:middle line:90%
and it did happen that way.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying there are
different-- precognitive dreams

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.354 align:middle line:90%
are different in quality.

00:19:35.354 --> 00:19:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: I'll give
you an example.

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Someone wrote me after I
was on "Coast to Coast."

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And then one of the people
who listen to the show

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:48.320 align:middle line:84%
sent me an email and
said, I had a dream

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:53.510 align:middle line:84%
where I actually went through
the whole thing and I saw 9/11.

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:55.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.600 align:middle line:90%
What is your comment on that?

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.040 align:middle line:84%
Because it would
be precognitive,

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.030 align:middle line:90%
before it happened.

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.864 align:middle line:84%
I think it was two days
before or something.

00:20:00.864 --> 00:20:02.113 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I've had those, too.

00:20:02.113 --> 00:20:03.430 align:middle line:90%
And it does happen like that.

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:05.480 align:middle line:90%
It had been collective psyche.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: It might be.

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the person was a
psychic in a past life

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:16.610 align:middle line:84%
and tends to pick
up drastic energy.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually not only
dramatic, but traumatic,

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.290 align:middle line:84%
because the energy of
trauma is much more

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:25.260 align:middle line:84%
powerful than the
energy of joy in terms

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.580 align:middle line:90%
of having an impact on us.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.038 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And if they have
those kind of psychic abilities,

00:20:29.038 --> 00:20:31.440 align:middle line:84%
why wouldn't they be
picking them up on the field

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:36.552 align:middle line:84%
of an event that is mounting
in its capacity to manifest?

00:20:36.552 --> 00:20:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: But you
see we always have

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:39.430 align:middle line:90%
to come back to the dreamer.

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: The dreamer is always
dreaming about the dreamer.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:46.020 align:middle line:84%
So it begs the question,
what was going on

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:50.280 align:middle line:84%
in her life at that time
that it felt like everything

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.980 align:middle line:90%
was threatening to blow up?

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.720 align:middle line:90%
And she will need to rewrite.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.220 align:middle line:90%
There will be a lot of losses.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.530 align:middle line:84%
There will be a lot
of transformation.

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And she's going to need to
rewrite relationships, jobs.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Almost what you were
describing about, Regina.

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:04.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: You see?

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:06.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very true.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.625 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: So it's
still the dreamer

00:21:08.625 --> 00:21:09.750 align:middle line:90%
dreaming about the dreamer.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Because Carl Jung spoke
about the unconscious

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:18.210 align:middle line:90%
through the animus.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have very strong
opinions on different things.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:28.100 align:middle line:84%
But it was never practical
enough for my clients.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:28.900 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:29.500 align:middle line:90%
It's curious.

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:30.420 align:middle line:90%
But it's not practical enough.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: So why curious?

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.150 align:middle line:84%
What is happening
in Johnny's life?

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:40.500 align:middle line:84%
What is happening in
Annie's life now, today?

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And what can I do to help them
manage it a little more gently?

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:45.970 align:middle line:90%
Let's keep it simple.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:46.770 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
they're there for.

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: You got it.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:50.840 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.100 align:middle line:84%
So precognitive, and after
that is an intuitive dream.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.330 align:middle line:84%
So anything more you want
to do to bridge those two?

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:58.074 align:middle line:90%


00:21:58.074 --> 00:21:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: The best
thing you can do

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:01.920 align:middle line:90%
is start recording your dreams.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Keep a record, because
then you can step back

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:09.390 align:middle line:84%
and begin to view
your history, you see?

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:11.070 align:middle line:10%
The most important
thing is-- and that's

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:13.860 align:middle line:10%
what I do in the book
on dreams, "Dreaming

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.770 align:middle line:10%
on Both Sides of the
Brain," is to give you

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:17.925 align:middle line:10%
instructions, very simple.

00:22:17.925 --> 00:22:18.841 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, tools.

00:22:18.841 --> 00:22:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah, very simple.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.630 align:middle line:90%
This is what you do.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:24.337 align:middle line:84%
You say-- when you go
to bed, not as soon

00:22:24.337 --> 00:22:25.170 align:middle line:90%
as you get into bed.

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.540 align:middle line:84%
But just before you fall
asleep, your brain waves

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:29.110 align:middle line:90%
are slowing down.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:32.340 align:middle line:84%
So whatever your brain
hears, it will use it

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.830 align:middle line:90%
as a self-hypnotic suggestion.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:37.180 align:middle line:90%
So you say out loud three times.

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Make sure that if you have
a mate in the bed with you,

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.730 align:middle line:84%
that they're not going to
poo-poo it or make fun of it.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:43.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:46.980 align:middle line:84%
So you say, I will remember
my dreams clearly and well,

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.900 align:middle line:84%
and write them down
when I wake up.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Or nowadays, record them on
my iPhone when I wake up.

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: But be clear about
what you're going to do,

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.700 align:middle line:84%
because the brain will
take it very literally.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: You say it
out loud three times.

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.440 align:middle line:84%
When you awaken-- and
you say it every night.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.500 align:middle line:84%
When you awaken, before
you go and you empty out

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.424 align:middle line:84%
other end of you, before
you go with your routine

00:23:10.424 --> 00:23:12.840 align:middle line:84%
to the restroom, the shower,
brushing your teeth, whatever

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.060 align:middle line:84%
it is you're going
to do, lean over

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.810 align:middle line:84%
and start writing or
recording immediately

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:22.500 align:middle line:84%
whatever comes into
your awareness.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.950 align:middle line:84%
You may not even be comfortable
enough with dreams yet

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:27.400 align:middle line:90%
to call it a dream.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.200 align:middle line:90%
So you say, I don't know.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what I dreamed.

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Because you're still in alpha,
those slower brain waves,

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:39.480 align:middle line:84%
and therefore you're
still in this wavy world

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.940 align:middle line:84%
between the unconscious
and the conscious.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Say whatever comes
into your awareness.

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's fascinating how
it would be relevant.

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: You start by
keeping the record.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.880 align:middle line:90%
Write down the date.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.066 align:middle line:84%
And write down whatever
comes into your awareness.

00:23:53.066 --> 00:23:53.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.520 align:middle line:84%
I find the alpha
state fascinating.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
where you're not

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.200 align:middle line:84%
choosing to go
into a meditation,

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.700 align:middle line:90%
but you're somewhere else.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.180 align:middle line:90%
You're suddenly somewhere else.

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And I find that a lot
where before I fall asleep,

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:09.030 align:middle line:84%
I'll just be somewhere
where I'm watching

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:11.610 align:middle line:84%
people in a conversation,
listening to everything they're

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:12.510 align:middle line:90%
saying.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:13.335 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: People you know?

00:24:13.335 --> 00:24:14.335 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, strangers.

00:24:14.335 --> 00:24:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Oh, really?

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:18.460 align:middle line:84%
You kind of hang
out somewhere else?

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:19.260 align:middle line:90%
How interesting.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.884 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before
going into sleep time.

00:24:20.884 --> 00:24:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes, yes.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I always
think, who was that?

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:27.135 align:middle line:84%
Why was I listening
to their conversation?

00:24:27.135 --> 00:24:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Pay attention
to the content.

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:31.041 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I need
to start doing that.

00:24:31.041 --> 00:24:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Because
it's relevant to you.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.660 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is accidental.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:36.900 align:middle line:84%
So if they're talking
about divorce,

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:41.440 align:middle line:84%
if they're talking about the
unfairness of people getting

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:45.512 align:middle line:84%
dismissed fast, even if their
job is working at McDonald's.

00:24:45.512 --> 00:24:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sometimes
they're just cooking.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.136 align:middle line:90%
They're just chatting.

00:24:48.136 --> 00:24:49.498 align:middle line:90%
I'm just watching strangers.

00:24:49.498 --> 00:24:51.622 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Yeah, but whatever
they are talking about,

00:24:51.622 --> 00:24:51.870 align:middle line:90%
whatever the tone--

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah, I'll
start paying attention.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes, please do.

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:55.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And in the kitchen,
it's about nourishment.

00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Nourishment, symbolically,
is nurturance.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:03.355 align:middle line:84%
So it's issues of
love and kindness.

00:25:03.355 --> 00:25:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.260 align:middle line:90%
I'll pay attention.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Please do.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I
bring that up in case

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.710 align:middle line:84%
anyone else has that
crossover experience where

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:10.104 align:middle line:90%
you're not asleep yet.

00:25:10.104 --> 00:25:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: That's right.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.327 align:middle line:90%
You're still in that hazy world.

00:25:13.327 --> 00:25:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I find it interesting.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: You see, when
you and I are talking now,

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:18.660 align:middle line:90%
we are in beta.

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:22.310 align:middle line:10%
Beta is 12 to 48
cycles per second,

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:23.720 align:middle line:10%
because the brain is measured.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.520 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:27.290 align:middle line:10%
>>COHEN: Electricity
is measured in cycles.

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:28.200 align:middle line:10%
That's beta.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.000 align:middle line:10%
So we're talking.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:29.900 align:middle line:10%
We're interacting.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.360 align:middle line:10%
Now, the next phase is alpha.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.670 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That 8 to 12, right?

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:35.590 align:middle line:10%
>>COHEN: You got it.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:36.390 align:middle line:10%
You got it.

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:37.320 align:middle line:10%
8 to 12.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.450 align:middle line:10%
How come you know?

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:40.145 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, I've studied
a lot of this stuff before.

00:25:40.145 --> 00:25:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Good for you.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because I used to do
a lot of regressions and things.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Good for you.

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And then the
next one, that's theta.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's meditative.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:46.840 align:middle line:84%
That's usually our
meditative state.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.920 align:middle line:90%
Alpha is meditative.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you get into the
unconscious, and that's theta.

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's 4 to 8
cycles per second.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the
deepest is delta.

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And delta is 1/2 a
cycle to 4 cycles.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's very important that
we give ourselves a chance

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.480 align:middle line:84%
to go into deep sleep,
because that's when

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:13.230 align:middle line:90%
we release growth hormones.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.571 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And growth hormones
are crucial for our development.

00:26:16.571 --> 00:26:18.957 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's happening
in delta for the most part

00:26:18.957 --> 00:26:19.790 align:middle line:90%
when we're sleeping?

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: In delta, yes.

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:21.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.275 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: This is when we
release those growth hormones.

00:26:24.275 --> 00:26:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's talk
about this for a moment.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In today's
world, because people are

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.247 align:middle line:84%
so distracted, they've
got all these signals--

00:26:30.247 --> 00:26:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: You got it.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.455 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --literally
frequencies

00:26:32.455 --> 00:26:36.621 align:middle line:84%
running through their house,
and microwaves and so forth,

00:26:36.621 --> 00:26:38.120 align:middle line:84%
I would think a lot
of people aren't

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.447 align:middle line:90%
getting into delta state.

00:26:39.447 --> 00:26:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: You got it.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.571 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're not doing
the self-repair at night.

00:26:42.571 --> 00:26:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Uh-huh, exactly.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's part of why there is
so much restlessness, agitation,

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:51.860 align:middle line:90%
confusion,

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Chronic illness.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:52.820 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Loss.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:53.620 align:middle line:90%
Hmm?

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Chronic illness.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Oh, God, yes.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.558 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Inflammation.

00:26:56.558 --> 00:26:58.020 align:middle line:90%
If you can't recovery at night--

00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Exactly.

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Because growth hormone
repair your cells.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And of course, who
has the most delta?

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Babies, because they're
developing their brains.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: So it's crucial to be
in that deep state, you see?

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:18.470 align:middle line:84%
But you need to try your best
to try a little more sleep,

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:21.140 align:middle line:84%
try a little more sleep,
try a little more.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.180 align:middle line:84%
How important it
is to give yourself

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:24.630 align:middle line:90%
permission to do that, you see?

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:26.410 align:middle line:90%
So back to dreams.

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:27.440 align:middle line:90%
You can dream in delta.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.080 align:middle line:90%
You can dream in theta.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:29.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:34.087 align:middle line:84%
But you have to bring them on
up into ultimate awareness.

00:27:34.087 --> 00:27:36.170 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And the way you
bring them into awareness

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:39.890 align:middle line:84%
is by starting to
express it consciously.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:42.950 align:middle line:84%
That's why you write it
down or you record it

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:45.202 align:middle line:90%
as soon as you awaken.

00:27:45.202 --> 00:27:47.660 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, you may wake
up in the middle of the night.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:49.340 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that was a strange dream.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.815 align:middle line:84%
Or people always say,
oh, I had a weird dream.

00:27:51.815 --> 00:27:52.940 align:middle line:90%
But dreams are never weird.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.939 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we don't
understand the language,

00:27:54.939 --> 00:27:56.900 align:middle line:90%
so we call it weird.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.150 align:middle line:90%
And you say, OK, I'm too tired.

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:00.350 align:middle line:90%
I remember it tomorrow.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what.

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:01.880 align:middle line:90%
By the time--

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:02.088 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's gone.

00:28:02.088 --> 00:28:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: --it's
tomorrow, it's gone.

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:06.920 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't cross over to
the other side of the brain.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:11.750 align:middle line:84%
That's why we call it dreaming
on both sides of the brain,

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.840 align:middle line:84%
so that you can record
this consciously.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Because the divine gave
us two sides to the brain,

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:18.440 align:middle line:90%
why don't we use them?

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.609 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:19.609 --> 00:28:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: You don't have
to be only in one or only

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:22.827 align:middle line:90%
in the other.

00:28:22.827 --> 00:28:23.910 align:middle line:90%
You can go back and forth.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:26.600 align:middle line:84%
By the way, as females,
there is something

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.030 align:middle line:84%
that is called the
corpus callosum, which

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:30.530 align:middle line:84%
is the band of
nerves that connects

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:32.210 align:middle line:90%
the left and the right brains.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Women have a much thicker
callosum than men do.

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is not a put
down of men, guys.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.920 align:middle line:84%
This is just that we can go back
and forth more readily and more

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:44.720 align:middle line:90%
easily.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:46.853 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: So let us use
it for heaven's sake.

00:28:46.853 --> 00:28:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And also that shows up sometimes
in the world of intuition.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:54.020 align:middle line:84%
So we're going from
precognitive dreaming,

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.800 align:middle line:84%
another one is
intuitive dreaming.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, talk about the
difference between the two

00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:59.840 align:middle line:90%
and how that shows up.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Intuitive
dreaming is when

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:07.340 align:middle line:84%
you get what is referred to
very often as a warning dream.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to share
something with you,

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.240 align:middle line:84%
and I mentioned
that in the book.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.970 align:middle line:90%
I was dating a young man.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:15.270 align:middle line:90%
We were both divorced.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:19.310 align:middle line:84%
We had a lot in common
in terms of our goals.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:21.080 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to start a family.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.850 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to start a family.

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:23.670 align:middle line:90%
He was Jewish.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:24.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jewish.

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:26.124 align:middle line:90%
And so we got along very well.

00:29:26.124 --> 00:29:27.290 align:middle line:90%
And it was very interesting.

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:29.240 align:middle line:90%
A very brief period.

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.080 align:middle line:90%
I have a dream.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm walking down
the street, and I

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:34.460 align:middle line:90%
see a little kiosk on the side.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:39.400 align:middle line:84%
I walk in and I see that someone
had written my autobiography.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, note, it's very
interesting when you begin

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:44.240 align:middle line:90%
to pay attention to details.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.200 align:middle line:84%
No, if somebody else
wrote a book about me,

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.004 align:middle line:90%
it's a biography.

00:29:48.004 --> 00:29:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A biography.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Right.

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:51.240 align:middle line:90%
Not my autobiography.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like the unconscious is
saying, Doris, pay attention.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.395 align:middle line:90%
This is yours, honey.

00:29:55.395 --> 00:29:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Autobiography.

00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:59.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:00.690 align:middle line:90%
I buy the book.

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:02.510 align:middle line:90%
I start reading it in the dream.

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:04.730 align:middle line:84%
I start reading
it as I'm walking

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:07.100 align:middle line:90%
outside that little kiosk.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:08.720 align:middle line:90%
And then I slam the book shut.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And I say, this is not
my story, because I

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.670 align:middle line:90%
don't like the way it ends.

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:15.410 align:middle line:90%
And I wake up.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had been working
with dreams already.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And I knew exactly
what I needed to do.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.930 align:middle line:84%
I needed to end
that relationship,

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:27.180 align:middle line:84%
because I would not
like the way it ended.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.030 align:middle line:90%
I did end it.

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:29.100 align:middle line:90%
And he was upset.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was sad, but I
was so clear about it.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.140 align:middle line:84%
A few months later,
I found out that he

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:38.100 align:middle line:84%
had a very serious problem
with drugs and alcohol

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:42.010 align:middle line:84%
that he had kept hidden very
effectively, even from someone

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:46.180 align:middle line:84%
like myself, a therapist, a
healer, et cetera, et cetera.

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:50.170 align:middle line:84%
It was a caution from my
unconscious and my guides.

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:52.450 align:middle line:90%
That's a warning.

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's the intuitive
part that is being played up.

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's a
beautiful example of it.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:01.790 align:middle line:90%
But also, you are intuitive.

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:03.610 align:middle line:90%
You're also an intuitive person.

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:06.626 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes there's the
interpretation involved

00:31:06.626 --> 00:31:08.750 align:middle line:84%
where someone would have
that dream and think, gee,

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:09.400 align:middle line:90%
what was that about?

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.320 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't necessarily
think to apply it

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.360 align:middle line:90%
to their relationship, right?

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Absolutely.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.240 align:middle line:10%
But you see, I've
written my book

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.100 align:middle line:10%
on "Dreaming on Both
Sides of the Brain."

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.180 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Because the best
metaphor that my dream

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:26.930 align:middle line:84%
guide has offered that applies
always is we always dream.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:28.940 align:middle line:10%
Use the metaphor of
today's newspaper.

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:29.740 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.680 align:middle line:10%
>>COHEN: Whatever is
uppermost in waking life,

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.390 align:middle line:10%
your dreams will
be dealing with it.

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:36.160 align:middle line:90%
It's not literal.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:39.050 align:middle line:90%
The theme is always relevant.

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:43.285 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what's occupying
your thoughts in waking hours.

00:31:43.285 --> 00:31:43.600 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Exactly.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
response to that.

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Exactly.

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: So in the newspaper,
it deals with current events.

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And there is always
an editorial.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And the editorial would be
critiquing or also praising.

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:56.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And your unconscious
will do exactly the same thing.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.290 align:middle line:84%
So whatever is uppermost
in your waking life,

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:07.090 align:middle line:84%
your dreams will always
be not only related to it,

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:10.560 align:middle line:84%
but also giving you
guidance about it.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And our unconscious
is so patient.

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:17.620 align:middle line:84%
So they'll say, Doris,
pay attention to this.

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.160 align:middle line:90%
Doris doesn't, let's say.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And then pay attention
to it over and over.

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And finally, it's like someone
banging at the front door.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.110 align:middle line:84%
They bang so loud, and
that becomes a nightmare.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:31.470 align:middle line:84%
How do we wake up
from nightmares?

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:33.820 align:middle line:90%
You know, shaking, heart racing.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.904 align:middle line:84%
And you remember the dream
when it's a nightmare.

00:32:35.904 --> 00:32:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that means you
haven't been paying attention

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.430 align:middle line:90%
to the more subtle dreams.

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.220 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:40.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:41.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.080 align:middle line:84%
So that's a good example
of a warning dream.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And here we have
health-related dreams,

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.920 align:middle line:84%
which sometimes come
knocking on people's doors.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:48.720 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Subtly, and then
it scares them, right?

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: But pause and
begin to address your dreams

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:59.650 align:middle line:84%
as with a sense of
awe and curiosity.

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:02.915 align:middle line:84%
Not just, oh, I had a weird
dream and just dismiss it.

00:33:02.915 --> 00:33:05.500 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing weird
about your dreams.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.630 align:middle line:90%
It is fascinating.

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:09.350 align:middle line:90%
The stories are endless.

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:12.160 align:middle line:84%
As a very simple little
example, this woman

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.440 align:middle line:84%
kept dreaming about
a yellow sofa.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:19.810 align:middle line:84%
A yellow sofa, a yellow-orange
sofa, over and over.

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK, let's take
a look at waking life.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.190 align:middle line:90%
Do you like yellow sofas?

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:24.990 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Are you planning
on buying a sofa?

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:27.850 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:32.200 align:middle line:84%
What's going on in your life
that is yellow and orange?

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh,
I like oranges,

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:39.130 align:middle line:84%
but I haven't been
eating them lately.

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh,
what about apricots?

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:43.120 align:middle line:90%
Apricots are very yellow.

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And because I know a lot
about nutrition as well,

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:52.540 align:middle line:84%
it turns out it's also very high
in vitamin A. She was lacking

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.880 align:middle line:84%
in vitamin A. So
her unconscious kept

00:33:54.880 --> 00:34:00.880 align:middle line:84%
saying, yellow sofa, a yellow
sofa, a yellow-orange sofa.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.900 align:middle line:90%
Go get it.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:02.910 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:04.810 align:middle line:84%
It's as though you're
explaining what you're

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:07.430 align:middle line:90%
dreaming about to a Martian.

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:08.389 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:09.889 align:middle line:84%
That makes sense,
because really, it

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:11.770 align:middle line:84%
was the color
therapy aspect of it

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:13.030 align:middle line:84%
that they were trying--
that her dream was

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:14.230 align:middle line:90%
trying to get through to her.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:15.563 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: It was not a nightmare.

00:34:15.563 --> 00:34:16.719 align:middle line:90%
It was just a nudge.

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:18.635 align:middle line:84%
You know, like someone
tugging at your sleeve.

00:34:18.635 --> 00:34:20.949 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, a yellow
sofa wouldn't necessarily

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:24.009 align:middle line:84%
constitute a nightmare
in most people's dreams.

00:34:24.009 --> 00:34:26.520 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, they may not
like the color scheme.

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.451 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes, yes.

00:34:27.451 --> 00:34:28.659 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, it was
the color frequency that

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.659 align:middle line:90%
was trying to impress itself.

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: That's right.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.140 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:34.070 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:35.695 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
health-related dreams,

00:34:35.695 --> 00:34:39.399 align:middle line:84%
when someone dreams they have
the same disease over and over.

00:34:39.399 --> 00:34:40.630 align:middle line:90%
Because that's common.

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:42.699 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: They have the
same disease appear.

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, like they
discover they have a disease,

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:48.159 align:middle line:84%
but they have the same
dream over and over.

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: That's fear.

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:49.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:49.890 --> 00:34:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Invariably.

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:53.770 align:middle line:84%
First of all, because
I'm a holistic therapist

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and I have been blessed
with having amazing guides--

00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:59.680 align:middle line:84%
that's going to sound
very opinionated,

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.670 align:middle line:90%
so please bear with me.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:05.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't buy 90% of all
the diagnosis of cancer,

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:06.743 align:middle line:90%
of Alzheimer's.

00:35:06.743 --> 00:35:07.701 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm with you.

00:35:07.701 --> 00:35:08.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm with you.

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: You are?

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.727 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Alzheimer's,
or all these, oh,

00:35:11.727 --> 00:35:13.310 align:middle line:84%
it's all because
you're getting older.

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Ah, please, I
think it's a crock.

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:16.450 align:middle line:90%
It's ridiculous.

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: So it's not
because a person is sick.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:23.250 align:middle line:84%
It's because they're
afraid of getting sick.

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And the sickness symbolically
represents the worst of it all.

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:30.300 align:middle line:90%
Our body is our vehicle.

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.960 align:middle line:84%
That's why when you dream
about a car, being in a car,

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:38.190 align:middle line:84%
if you're driving the car
you're in charge of your body.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:40.170 align:middle line:84%
If someone else
is driving the car

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:42.090 align:middle line:84%
and you're in the
back seat, you're

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:46.110 align:middle line:90%
not in charge of your body.

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So you better start
paying attention.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Are you handing your power
over to someone else?

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:53.490 align:middle line:90%
This is about a power issue.

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:59.370 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to disease,
because we're so bombarded--

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:00.600 align:middle line:90%
this could lead to cancer.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.849 align:middle line:90%
And this could lead to cancer.

00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:03.900 align:middle line:90%
And this could lead to cancer--

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.860 align:middle line:84%
people might be
reassured if they go

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:09.930 align:middle line:84%
and they have some tests
in order to rule it out.

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, tests will
only lead to more tests.

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.520 align:middle line:90%
That's a Pandora's box.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And that, I find
very depressing.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah.

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:20.910 align:middle line:90%
So that's my view.

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:21.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a physician.

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: I'm a doctor.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:29.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm a PhD psychologist, but I
don't believe in any of this.

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.130 align:middle line:84%
You and I are on a very
similar page on that.

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:35.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I wanted to
know about health dreams,

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:37.620 align:middle line:84%
because those are
frightening to people,

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.360 align:middle line:84%
that they've just
been diagnosed with--

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:43.290 align:middle line:84%
well, cancer dreams,
because cancer is ubiquitous

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:44.740 align:middle line:90%
in our world around us.

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:47.550 align:middle line:84%
You can't go through a magazine
without reading about cancer

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and seeing advertisements
about cancer or pink ribbons

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:51.970 align:middle line:90%
about cancer.

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:52.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:54.519 align:middle line:10%
>>COHEN: You know, Dr.
Christiane Northrup

00:36:54.519 --> 00:36:56.460 align:middle line:10%
wrote the foreword
to both of my books.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:00.960 align:middle line:10%
She's a very well-known
OB-GYN, and really a pioneer.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.280 align:middle line:90%
And she put it very well.

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Why do we march for
cancer, breast cancer?

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:05.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Why don't we
march for breast health?

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we all
salute each other

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and say, wow, we have
beautiful breasts that can

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.930 align:middle line:90%
nurture and nourish each other.

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:18.739 align:middle line:90%
And pink, I can't stand it.

00:37:18.739 --> 00:37:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I can't either.

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
subconscious-- to me,

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:23.170 align:middle line:90%
this is a subconscious program.

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That creates
this acceptance

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.180 align:middle line:90%
of cancer in our lives.

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 1 in 3 of you
is going to have cancer.

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Thank you.

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Get used to it.

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.200 align:middle line:90%
Accept it.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.630 align:middle line:90%
It's a social club.

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:35.430 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: You know, and
this brings up something

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:39.270 align:middle line:90%
so important and valuable.

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:43.020 align:middle line:90%
We manifest whatever we believe.

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:47.699 align:middle line:10%
The seminal work on that was
done by Bruce Lipton, PhD.

00:37:47.699 --> 00:37:48.990 align:middle line:10%
Are you familiar with his work?

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:49.206 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:37:49.206 --> 00:37:50.400 align:middle line:10%
I did one of the first
interviews with him--

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.358 align:middle line:10%
>>COHEN: Is that right?

00:37:51.358 --> 00:37:53.730 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: --when he was
just getting started.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:55.110 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: It's wonderful.

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And it is alarming how
the medical profession

00:37:58.290 --> 00:37:59.625 align:middle line:90%
dismisses him outright.

00:37:59.625 --> 00:38:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.766 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And we change our
genes in the process as well.

00:38:03.766 --> 00:38:04.566 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:38:04.566 --> 00:38:05.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's the genetics.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.392 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:38:07.392 --> 00:38:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I would
say to anyone who

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:11.345 align:middle line:84%
hasn't read his first book,
"The Biology of Belief."

00:38:11.345 --> 00:38:12.270 align:middle line:10%
>>COHEN: "The
Biology of Belief."

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:13.300 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It's very important.

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:13.770 align:middle line:10%
I think it's valuable to life.

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:14.920 align:middle line:10%
>>COHEN: I recommend
it to everybody.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:15.720 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:16.860 align:middle line:10%
>>COHEN: Yeah.

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:20.890 align:middle line:10%
I have a niece who is a
physician and brilliant.

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:21.690 align:middle line:90%
She's brilliant.

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:23.810 align:middle line:90%
But she's not holistic.

00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And as much as I've said,
oh, please, open up.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.930 align:middle line:90%
Open up.

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:30.600 align:middle line:84%
You have such a
strong foundation.

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:33.840 align:middle line:84%
As a conventional physician,
great, you have the data.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.670 align:middle line:90%
You have the tools.

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:36.720 align:middle line:90%
Now, open up.

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.556 align:middle line:90%
How amazing it would be.

00:38:38.556 --> 00:38:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: No.

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:43.816 align:middle line:90%
It's very discouraging.

00:38:43.816 --> 00:38:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:47.220 align:middle line:84%
But there are more people
who are opening up.

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:48.734 align:middle line:90%
So I mean, en masse we're--

00:38:48.734 --> 00:38:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Enough of us.

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:51.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, enough are.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:51.800 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.966 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to another
big fear dream; death.

00:38:53.966 --> 00:38:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: OK.

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Hence, this is going to be
the subject of my next book.

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Tell me, how many people do
you know who did not die?

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:05.850 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: We say Jesus ascended.

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:07.161 align:middle line:90%
Maybe Moses did.

00:39:07.161 --> 00:39:08.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about the Buddha.

00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:10.590 align:middle line:90%
I think he actually died.

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Two or three people that we know
of who became whatever and did

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:16.770 align:middle line:90%
not die.

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Since we're all going
to die, shouldn't we

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.784 align:middle line:84%
try and get to know
what it is about?

00:39:20.784 --> 00:39:22.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And arguably,
have died many times before.

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:23.060 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Exactly.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not new.

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Exactly.

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:25.620 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:28.320 align:middle line:84%
You see, I am very
spiritual inclined.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about
religion, again.

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:33.420 align:middle line:84%
But a loving God has
created all of us.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Do you think a loving God is
going to give each soul just

00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:38.130 align:middle line:90%
one chance?

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Make it or break it.

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't,
you know, tough.

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:45.147 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
banished, or you lost out.

00:39:45.147 --> 00:39:46.230 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make any sense.

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:47.563 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It doesn't make sense.

00:39:47.563 --> 00:39:48.917 align:middle line:90%
No, it doesn't.

00:39:48.917 --> 00:39:50.292 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And my
guides and angels

00:39:50.292 --> 00:39:52.710 align:middle line:84%
have always said,
everything in God's world

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:56.220 align:middle line:84%
makes sense if we look long
enough and deep enough.

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:58.560 align:middle line:90%
And God loves us.

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:02.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure God looks from up
there at us and says, oy,

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:05.610 align:middle line:84%
they take everything
so seriously.

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:07.320 align:middle line:90%
You know, lighten up already.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:07.571 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:07.571 --> 00:40:08.695 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Go dance a little.

00:40:08.695 --> 00:40:09.727 align:middle line:90%
Laugh a little.

00:40:09.727 --> 00:40:11.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And on the
subject of death,

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:14.040 align:middle line:84%
even, I mean, I've
interviewed a lot of people

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:17.230 align:middle line:84%
on the subject of near-death
experiences and Raymond Moody.

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:19.480 align:middle line:84%
I was with him a couple
of times and all that.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that
seems to come through

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:23.560 align:middle line:84%
is when people go
through this process,

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:26.680 align:middle line:84%
however far they go through
after the heart stops beating

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:29.530 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, most of them
don't want to come back.

00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Most of them say
it was beautiful.

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:34.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's very, very rare
that someone says, oh, my God.

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:36.730 align:middle line:90%
That was a horrid experience.

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:38.470 align:middle line:84%
I dread having to
go through it again.

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:39.805 align:middle line:90%
It's the opposite.

00:40:39.805 --> 00:40:40.605 align:middle line:90%
It's a grace.

00:40:40.605 --> 00:40:43.099 align:middle line:84%
There's a grace in
letting go of one life.

00:40:43.099 --> 00:40:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: That's a
wonderful way you put it.

00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:46.090 align:middle line:90%
Grace.

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:49.900 align:middle line:84%
It's gracious because
God loves us all the time

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:51.250 align:middle line:90%
unconditionally.

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:52.750 align:middle line:90%
What is unconditional?

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:54.160 align:middle line:90%
No conditions.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So we can't say God loves
us only if I'm a good girl.

00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Or a good boy.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:40:59.680 align:middle line:90%
You see.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.890 align:middle line:84%
So dreams about death,
death is an ending.

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:04.420 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And when we want to talk
about death literally,

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:09.070 align:middle line:90%
it's a doorway.

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:12.970 align:middle line:84%
You move from-- the soul
resides in-- your soul

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:18.040 align:middle line:84%
chose to live in a female
body this time around, Regina.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure many a
time before it has

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:24.580 align:middle line:90%
chosen to live in a male body.

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Whether that body was
African-American, Asian, small,

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:33.400 align:middle line:84%
big, short, tall, thin,
fat, whatever, it's

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.960 align:middle line:90%
just the vehicle.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And we lived so many
times, so many times.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:42.310 align:middle line:84%
So when we can begin to set
aside our fear of death,

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:47.030 align:middle line:84%
look at how much more joy it
would be to live your life.

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:49.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not that bugaboo
that's at the end.

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.530 align:middle line:90%
Are you going to die?

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:52.680 align:middle line:90%
So you will also live.

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:53.510 align:middle line:90%
So you will die.

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:54.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:54.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:54.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And if you haven't
finished, you come back

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:57.530 align:middle line:90%
and you fix it.

00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:00.850 align:middle line:84%
You and I are on the
same page on that.

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:01.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:02.870 align:middle line:90%
Another one is pregnancy.

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: I love it.

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:05.582 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do men ever
dream of pregnancy?

00:42:05.582 --> 00:42:06.540 align:middle line:90%
Is that just a female--

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:07.498 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Not as common.

00:42:07.498 --> 00:42:08.450 align:middle line:90%
Females typically.

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Now with all of this
transgender stuff--

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be politically
incorrect again.

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:16.370 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
not the time for it.

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:18.430 align:middle line:90%
So I will set it aside.

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Typically, in my experience, men
do not report pregnancy dreams.

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And maybe because they are so
conditioned that they're not

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.140 align:middle line:90%
supposed to have that.

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:31.330 align:middle line:84%
So they don't choose it
as a vehicle to express.

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:32.300 align:middle line:90%
What's pregnancy?

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.091 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
why I ask, because--

00:42:34.091 --> 00:42:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: When you're
ready to create

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.620 align:middle line:90%
a new being, a new situation.

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.230 align:middle line:90%
So what pregnancy dreams--

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:44.472 align:middle line:84%
I've had a pregnancy
dream in my 60's.

00:42:44.472 --> 00:42:45.550 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Even the women have given
birth in their 50's and 60's.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.810 align:middle line:84%
It had nothing to do with
being pregnant biologically.

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:55.670 align:middle line:90%
But pregnancy is getting ready.

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:57.820 align:middle line:84%
It's making all the
necessary preparations

00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:01.240 align:middle line:84%
to give birth to a
new aspect of you.

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the dreamer is always
dreaming about the dreamer.

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:08.650 align:middle line:84%
So if you're 60, or if
you're 20, or if you're 40,

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:09.670 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:11.590 align:middle line:84%
If you're having
a pregnancy dream,

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:13.570 align:middle line:84%
it's that you're getting
ready to give birth

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:15.440 align:middle line:90%
to new aspects of self.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Again, related to what
is uppermost in your life

00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:20.620 align:middle line:90%
in waking life.

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:21.421 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:21.421 --> 00:43:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: You see?

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that makes sense.

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:23.860 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.858 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to toss
something at you.

00:43:25.858 --> 00:43:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So I was told I could
never have children

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:30.790 align:middle line:90%
when I was very, very young.

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:32.140 align:middle line:90%
It's a long story.

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And they said, that's
it, so get used to it.

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So for about 12 to 15
years, I had a dream

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:38.610 align:middle line:90%
I had this perfect baby son.

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Wow.

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:41.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when he
came into the world,

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:43.990 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to protect him,
because I didn't want anyone

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:45.040 align:middle line:90%
to take him away from me.

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And we'd go on a
run together, and it

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:47.810 align:middle line:90%
was me and my little boy.

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Wow.

00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:50.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
as it turned out,

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:52.390 align:middle line:84%
I knew what he looked
like, what his disposition

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:53.560 align:middle line:90%
was like and everything.

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And when I did get pregnant,
which was a miracle according

00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:00.784 align:middle line:84%
to modern medicine,
he was exactly

00:44:00.784 --> 00:44:01.950 align:middle line:90%
like the being in my dreams.

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:02.360 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Wow.

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.526 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I always feel
like he was working with me,

00:44:04.526 --> 00:44:06.580 align:middle line:90%
like our guides and angels do.

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:09.480 align:middle line:84%
On the other side, we were
working together again.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Again, this companionship
during dream time.

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:18.190 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: One of my clients,
happily married for years.

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:20.112 align:middle line:84%
Both she and her
husband, no children.

00:44:20.112 --> 00:44:21.570 align:middle line:84%
No, no, we don't
want any children.

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:23.140 align:middle line:90%
So I'm also a Reiki master.

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:25.660 align:middle line:84%
So I was doing some
healings on her.

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:27.010 align:middle line:90%
And I kept getting--

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:31.270 align:middle line:84%
hearing a voice saying,
I'm getting ready.

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:32.360 align:middle line:90%
I want to come in.

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.160 align:middle line:90%
I want to come in.

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: So I would
tell her, I hear

00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:40.090 align:middle line:84%
a soul saying that he
or she wants to come in.

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:41.350 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no, no.

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Finally, she started
looking at it.

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:43.750 align:middle line:90%
She was ready.

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Her husband was
not ready at all.

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:46.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: But finally, he was
so opposed to it because they

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:54.780 align:middle line:90%
were very comfortable.

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:56.340 align:middle line:90%
They had everything they wanted.

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:57.140 align:middle line:90%
It was fine.

00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:58.750 align:middle line:90%
It was OK.

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:00.820 align:middle line:90%
He resisted it and resisted it.

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:02.170 align:middle line:90%
And finally, she got pregnant.

00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:04.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, women can
trick men very easily.

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:08.020 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have that
thicker corpus callosum.

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:09.330 align:middle line:90%
We can go back and forth.

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Trickery.

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And he now
adores this boy.

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:14.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Adores him.

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it was-- I
found it interesting.

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:19.930 align:middle line:84%
I found it almost like
a series of dreams

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:23.160 align:middle line:84%
over the years that was prepping
both of us for that experience.

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes, yes.

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:26.440 align:middle line:90%
And also preparing you.

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:29.020 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you a hypothesis
that's just kind

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:31.870 align:middle line:90%
of a hunch that's coming up.

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:35.650 align:middle line:84%
You must have had a past life
where your baby, your son,

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:37.580 align:middle line:84%
was wrenched or
taken away from you

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:42.550 align:middle line:84%
so horrifically or died
accidentally so painfully.

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:43.930 align:middle line:90%
And you felt so guilty.

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was one where
that definitely happened.

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Really?

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And my son
in this lifetime and I

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:52.570 align:middle line:90%
have been each other's parents.

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:55.510 align:middle line:84%
We kind of rotate
back and forth.

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'd actually taken a
break for a few lifetimes,

00:45:58.570 --> 00:45:59.370 align:middle line:90%
because I had not--

00:45:59.370 --> 00:45:59.496 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Exactly.

00:45:59.496 --> 00:46:00.750 align:middle line:90%
You didn't want it anymore.

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.640 align:middle line:90%
I had--

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it was too much.

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And I did lose one little
boy that I absolutely

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:08.980 align:middle line:84%
adored in a lifetime
not that long ago.

00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:09.924 align:middle line:90%
It was very sad.

00:46:09.924 --> 00:46:12.340 align:middle line:84%
The house caught on fire and
he was upstairs, and he died.

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Oh, my God.

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And of course, as a
parent, losing a child

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:20.890 align:middle line:84%
is the single most wounding
experience that we can have.

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:22.750 align:middle line:90%
And we feel guilty.

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:24.880 align:middle line:84%
So what we do, we
do something funky.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.270 align:middle line:90%
We vow.

00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:27.070 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:28.900 align:middle line:84%
I'll never have
another child again.

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:30.460 align:middle line:90%
I cannot go through this.

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:32.265 align:middle line:90%
Well, vows are very powerful.

00:46:32.265 --> 00:46:33.265 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very powerful.

00:46:33.265 --> 00:46:34.065 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:34.065 --> 00:46:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And they
transcend time and place.

00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:37.780 align:middle line:90%
So I'm sure for a few lifetimes.

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:39.740 align:middle line:84%
So the work, the
ongoing work you

00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:42.760 align:middle line:84%
were doing through
the dream context

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:46.100 align:middle line:84%
was to prepare you to
open up to receive again.

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:48.774 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Because you
were not going to do it.

00:46:48.774 --> 00:46:50.920 align:middle line:84%
You were not going
to allow a pregnancy

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.010 align:middle line:90%
to take place otherwise.

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:54.110 align:middle line:90%
No, I agree with you on that.

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And my body was set up
perfectly to never get pregnant.

00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:59.340 align:middle line:84%
That was kind of a
miracle, which is good

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.190 align:middle line:90%
that it worked out that way.

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:02.450 align:middle line:90%
But I do agree with you.

00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:03.720 align:middle line:90%
And it was preparatory time.

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Sure.

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:05.894 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sometimes,
again, there

00:47:05.894 --> 00:47:08.710 align:middle line:84%
can be these
communications happening

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:10.660 align:middle line:84%
between other beings
and other dimensions

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:12.239 align:middle line:84%
during dream time
with ourselves.

00:47:12.239 --> 00:47:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Yes, there
is, but remember,

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:15.060 align:middle line:90%
the focus is still you.

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:15.802 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it's still you.

00:47:15.802 --> 00:47:16.626 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: It's still self.

00:47:16.626 --> 00:47:17.426 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:17.426 --> 00:47:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: So when people say, as
I said earlier, anima, animus,

00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:23.020 align:middle line:90%
you dream about your tribe.

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:24.970 align:middle line:90%
You dream about it.

00:47:24.970 --> 00:47:26.530 align:middle line:90%
There have been dreamers.

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Like in ancient times, someone
that was particularly intuitive

00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:32.300 align:middle line:84%
might be the dreamer
for the group.

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:33.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:35.720 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And by warnings,
cautions, or whatever.

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:38.455 align:middle line:84%
But generally speaking,
it's all about you.

00:47:38.455 --> 00:47:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:40.470 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:43.282 align:middle line:90%
So we're having so much fun.

00:47:43.282 --> 00:47:44.740 align:middle line:84%
We only have about
10 minutes left.

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And I have only gotten to like
point two on my little script

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:48.340 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.130 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into a couple of
areas like-- oh, this one,

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:51.930 align:middle line:90%
I love.

00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:53.800 align:middle line:90%
Get into some common dreams.

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:56.010 align:middle line:90%
Like we show up naked in public.

00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Oh.

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:58.463 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I used
to show up on set

00:47:58.463 --> 00:47:59.740 align:middle line:90%
as a news anchor in my dreams.

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:01.030 align:middle line:90%
I'd show up naked.

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And they had nothing to
clip my microphone to.

00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:06.510 align:middle line:84%
But other people show
naked for a lot of things.

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
showing up naked.

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: If we just refer to
yours, that's fascinating.

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:11.927 align:middle line:90%
Naked is what?

00:48:11.927 --> 00:48:13.260 align:middle line:90%
Always remember it's very easy--

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:14.135 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Vulnerable.

00:48:14.135 --> 00:48:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Ah, bravo.

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:18.550 align:middle line:84%
If you are going to explain
what naked is to a Martian,

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:19.750 align:middle line:90%
you say, without clothes.

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:21.460 align:middle line:90%
What do clothes do?

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:24.710 align:middle line:90%
They are the roles that we play.

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:26.230 align:middle line:90%
They also are protective.

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:29.300 align:middle line:84%
You wear a coat if it's
raining and so forth.

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:31.600 align:middle line:84%
So when you're not wearing
anything and you're naked,

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.250 align:middle line:90%
you're very vulnerable.

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And you might feel
so self-conscious.

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:38.770 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating in your
dream is there was nothing

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:40.990 align:middle line:90%
to hook up the mic to.

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:42.460 align:middle line:90%
And what was that about?

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:43.810 align:middle line:90%
It was about your work.

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Your work is all about
connecting with a mic

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:46.780 align:middle line:90%
and speaking.

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: So you felt very
vulnerable about whatever

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:54.060 align:middle line:84%
was going on in
waking life regarding

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:57.010 align:middle line:84%
the fluidity, the
flow, and the ease

00:48:57.010 --> 00:49:01.560 align:middle line:84%
with which you wanted to
express the questions,

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.930 align:middle line:84%
the interviewing, the
experience of being the reporter

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:06.860 align:middle line:90%
that you've been.

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:10.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so for all
of us, when we show up naked,

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.920 align:middle line:84%
look at the context
of, again, what's

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.350 align:middle line:84%
happening in your everyday
life that is on your mind

00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:14.695 align:middle line:90%
or of concern.

00:49:14.695 --> 00:49:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Exactly.

00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:15.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:16.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: That is
uppermost in your--

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're feeling
vulnerable in that area.

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And that is uppermost
in your life.

00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:26.245 align:middle line:84%
So if, let's say, you have
a job offer very high,

00:49:26.245 --> 00:49:28.240 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful and
amazing job offer,

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.820 align:middle line:84%
let's say, to go
to another country,

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.280 align:middle line:84%
and you've always been
nervous about travel

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.020 align:middle line:84%
because you're afraid
of flying, but this

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:37.000 align:middle line:90%
will entail a lot of flying.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's great, and
you're terrified.

00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:44.370 align:middle line:84%
So you may have the
dream of you showing up

00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:47.800 align:middle line:84%
at your new place of
work, but you're naked.

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And there is nowhere
to place that mic.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:50.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's like [GASPING].

00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:51.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:52.730 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen?

00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:54.830 align:middle line:90%
I am worthy, but my am I worthy?

00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Can I do it?

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:56.600 align:middle line:90%
Can I even get there?

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.400 align:middle line:90%
You see.

00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:58.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: So a much more common--

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:02.270 align:middle line:84%
there are two very
common dreams.

00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:03.070 align:middle line:90%
Very common.

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:05.159 align:middle line:90%
One is looking for a bathroom.

00:50:05.159 --> 00:50:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the next
thing I was going to ask you,

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:10.750 align:middle line:84%
is these dreams about the
bathroom and our elimination

00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:11.550 align:middle line:90%
processes.

00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:12.350 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: A toilet.

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:13.184 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:13.184 --> 00:50:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: If you're looking for a
toilet and you're going to pee,

00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:17.200 align:middle line:90%
it's being pissed off.

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.910 align:middle line:84%
It's issues of
anger, symbolically.

00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:22.560 align:middle line:84%
You want to discharge
issues of anger.

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:24.819 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't find a
place, I've go to pee.

00:50:24.819 --> 00:50:26.360 align:middle line:84%
I've got to pee,
but I can't find it.

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:29.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're in
a street downtown.

00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:32.140 align:middle line:84%
You can't find the
vehicle, the setting

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:36.110 align:middle line:84%
that is safe and appropriate
to get your anger out.

00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:38.900 align:middle line:84%
That's what your
unconscious is saying.

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:42.260 align:middle line:84%
The other, if you are
going to be releasing feces

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.350 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
have a bowel movement,

00:50:44.350 --> 00:50:45.350 align:middle line:90%
you want to get rid of--

00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:48.260 align:middle line:84%
I will not use the
four letter word.

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:52.610 align:middle line:84%
You want to get rid of burdens
that are toxic in your life.

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And you can't find the means
or the vehicle to do it.

00:50:56.210 --> 00:51:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about the
different qualities of poo?

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:03.314 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people dream
about all kinds poo.

00:51:03.314 --> 00:51:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: This is very
important to pay attention to.

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:06.813 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, talk about that.

00:51:06.813 --> 00:51:10.800 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: If you dream about your
feces coming out very watery,

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:14.720 align:middle line:84%
you may really need to take
a look at your waking life.

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.720 align:middle line:84%
First of all, am I having
regular bowel movements?

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:21.980 align:middle line:84%
Because if I'm not having
regular bowel movements,

00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:24.170 align:middle line:90%
it's going to affect my health.

00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:28.200 align:middle line:84%
So my unconscious is cautioning
me and saying, it's watery.

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention.

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:31.070 align:middle line:90%
Go do something.

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:32.390 align:middle line:90%
Get some supplements.

00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:33.680 align:middle line:90%
Get some herbs.

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:36.080 align:middle line:90%
Eat differently, you see.

00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:39.830 align:middle line:84%
If I'm having
constipation, same message.

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:40.790 align:middle line:90%
You see.

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And if it's constipated in the
dream, it means I am so uptight

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm holding on to all the
things I need to release,

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.842 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not releasing them.

00:51:48.842 --> 00:51:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then in
the case of other people,

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.790 align:middle line:84%
they'll have dreams
about every color

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:56.660 align:middle line:84%
and type and volume
of poo imaginable.

00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: If you're
releasing a lot,

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:01.340 align:middle line:84%
congratulate yourself
in the morning.

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:04.310 align:middle line:90%
And say, yay for Regina.

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:05.680 align:middle line:90%
Good for you, honey.

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:07.160 align:middle line:90%
You're releasing so much.

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.320 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:10.109 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:52:10.109 --> 00:52:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's go
to another one that's

00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:14.233 align:middle line:84%
common to people, which is
they'll find themselves going

00:52:14.233 --> 00:52:18.680 align:middle line:84%
back to, say, a similar house
or home or place over and over.

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Over and over.

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:21.590 align:middle line:90%
Or to school.

00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, school, that's
probably the most common.

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:26.172 align:middle line:84%
Failing or not showing
up in time for your exam.

00:52:26.172 --> 00:52:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: For your exam.

00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or to
turn your papers in.

00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:29.845 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: But you
asked about the house.

00:52:29.845 --> 00:52:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.546 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: What is a
house if you're going

00:52:31.546 --> 00:52:32.900 align:middle line:90%
to explain that to a Martian?

00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:36.180 align:middle line:84%
It is a place where you
reside, where you live.

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So it has to do
with how you live.

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:43.040 align:middle line:84%
If that house is in a setting
or it reminds you of something

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:47.270 align:middle line:84%
you used to do 20 years ago, so
what is your unconscious saying

00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:48.320 align:middle line:90%
to Regina?

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:52.370 align:middle line:84%
You need to go back to this
particular theme, because you

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:54.240 align:middle line:90%
need to review it again.

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you need to change
how you used to react then.

00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:01.700 align:middle line:84%
When you're going back
maybe 20 years ago,

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:03.860 align:middle line:84%
you were a little too
impatient, or if I

00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:09.170 align:middle line:84%
will say it about myself, I was
a little too hasty, let's say.

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And maybe my
unconscious is saying,

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:12.770 align:middle line:90%
you were too hasty then.

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:15.550 align:middle line:84%
How about now making a change
of being a little more patient

00:53:15.550 --> 00:53:16.420 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:16.850 align:middle line:90%
That's the message.

00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:17.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: That's the message.

00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:19.915 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
the quality of the home?

00:53:19.915 --> 00:53:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Maybe going to something
that's a little hovel, dirty,

00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:26.390 align:middle line:84%
disorganized versus something
spacious and rambling and

00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:27.440 align:middle line:90%
beautiful.

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:32.000 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: When you go into a
home that is like a hovel,

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.640 align:middle line:84%
the unconscious is
desperately trying

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.320 align:middle line:84%
to get your attention
to do something

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:40.160 align:middle line:84%
about how you live your
everyday life when you're awake.

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:41.120 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:46.670 align:middle line:84%
That you're living with
beliefs that are constricting.

00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:49.190 align:middle line:84%
It's as though emotionally,
physically, financially,

00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:53.000 align:middle line:84%
you feel impoverished,
whether it is directly related

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.990 align:middle line:84%
to how much money, dollar signs,
you have in the bank or not.

00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:59.560 align:middle line:84%
But you're
constricting yourself.

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you're in
a relationship that

00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:06.690 align:middle line:84%
is so painful and damaging
that it feels as though you

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:08.520 align:middle line:84%
are like the
poorest of the poor,

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:09.770 align:middle line:90%
and you don't have choices.

00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:11.570 align:middle line:90%
You don't have options.

00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:13.760 align:middle line:84%
When you're actually
dreaming about a house

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:15.550 align:middle line:84%
that has a lot of
light coming in.

00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:16.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A lot of room.

00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:17.675 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: And a lot of room.

00:54:17.675 --> 00:54:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And you discover rooms you
didn't even know were there.

00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:20.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: I love it.

00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:22.434 align:middle line:90%
A lot of times.

00:54:22.434 --> 00:54:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love those, too.

00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah.

00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Then what's the
unconscious saying?

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:28.575 align:middle line:90%
There is so much more to Regina.

00:54:28.575 --> 00:54:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:33.080 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Begin the process of
discovering and bringing up,

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:37.730 align:middle line:84%
because you will discover
other layers, other skills,

00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:40.160 align:middle line:84%
other gifts that you
have never developed yet

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.570 align:middle line:90%
that will bring more light.

00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we would
like to have those dreams.

00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Oh, yeah.

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:45.174 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Those are good dreams.

00:54:45.174 --> 00:54:45.973 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:45.973 --> 00:54:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Not all
dreams are useful.

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:49.760 align:middle line:84%
If we say one is a bad
dream, one is a good dream,

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:50.690 align:middle line:90%
we're judging them.

00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:51.350 align:middle line:90%
And therefore--

00:54:51.350 --> 00:54:51.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: --we're losing
some of the value.

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I take it back.

00:54:54.350 --> 00:54:55.070 align:middle line:90%
I take it back.

00:54:55.070 --> 00:54:57.069 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: No, oh, please,
I'm not correcting you,

00:54:57.069 --> 00:55:00.296 align:middle line:84%
but it's just to point out
that all dreams are helpful.

00:55:00.296 --> 00:55:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
yeah, absolutely.

00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:03.410 align:middle line:84%
So we have these
in homes, and we

00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:06.720 align:middle line:84%
have these with places,
physical places, in the world.

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was telling
you one very briefly

00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:13.430 align:middle line:84%
just before we start rolling
that I would go into in dream

00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:16.730 align:middle line:84%
time for years and years
into a secret city,

00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:19.010 align:middle line:84%
a walled ancient
city within a city.

00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:20.032 align:middle line:90%
And it could be within--

00:55:20.032 --> 00:55:22.240 align:middle line:84%
it could be anywhere in the
world I'd been to before.

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.040 align:middle line:90%
It could be Paris.

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:24.580 align:middle line:90%
It could be San Francisco.

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:26.170 align:middle line:84%
But in the middle,
I'd think, oh,

00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:29.110 align:middle line:84%
it's time to go to my
ancient sacred city.

00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'd go find the
way into the wall.

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:32.530 align:middle line:90%
It was a walled city.

00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:33.350 align:middle line:90%
And it was ancient.

00:55:33.350 --> 00:55:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the color of
the stones and everything.

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:37.510 align:middle line:84%
I'd go to all my
favorite places there.

00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Every time the same
people were there.

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:44.740 align:middle line:84%
But then one day,
in 2005, I went to--

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:47.730 align:middle line:84%
in real life, I went to
Jerusalem, the walled city.

00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And as I was walking down the
stairs toward Via Dolorosa,

00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:52.550 align:middle line:90%
my feet knew--

00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:53.350 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Wow.

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the
way, and I thought--

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Oh, my God.

00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --I've
been here before.

00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: You've
been there before.

00:55:57.900 --> 00:55:58.858 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I had chills.

00:55:58.858 --> 00:56:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, my
feet know this place.

00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:02.050 align:middle line:90%
They know these stones.

00:56:02.050 --> 00:56:04.330 align:middle line:84%
I never dreamed about
the walled city again.

00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Wow.

00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Done.

00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:08.927 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: If we look at the
symbolism of the walled city,

00:56:08.927 --> 00:56:11.260 align:middle line:84%
since the dreamer is always
dreaming about the dreamer--

00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:12.593 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's why I'm--

00:56:12.593 --> 00:56:13.540 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: It's your center.

00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:18.130 align:middle line:84%
It's the center of
whomever Regina is.

00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:20.390 align:middle line:84%
So it would be a
good idea to look at,

00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:26.590 align:middle line:84%
what am I secretly holding
in or protecting in myself

00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:29.200 align:middle line:84%
that I don't feel
safe enough to share?

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
something happened.

00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:32.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, absolutely.

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:33.810 align:middle line:90%
I just put it together.

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:34.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:56:34.650 --> 00:56:37.210 align:middle line:84%
I know what happened when I was
there in Israel at that time.

00:56:37.210 --> 00:56:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: What did you realize?

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:42.654 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I went into a cave at
the John the Baptist monastery.

00:56:42.654 --> 00:56:43.570 align:middle line:90%
The John the Baptist--

00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:44.500 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes, yes.

00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Above
that baptismal well

00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:49.840 align:middle line:84%
is a cave they say John
the Baptist meditated

00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:53.140 align:middle line:84%
in all the time up in those
wild hills of Ein Karem.

00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I had a profound
experience in opening

00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:59.020 align:middle line:84%
that was probably the most
profound experience of my life.

00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:00.460 align:middle line:90%
Never put it together till now.

00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:03.690 align:middle line:84%
That happened while spending
my time in Jerusalem.

00:57:03.690 --> 00:57:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Isn't that wonderful?

00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
freed something.

00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:07.150 align:middle line:90%
I never dreamed of it again.

00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And you may have
been at the time of Jesus.

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:11.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Possibly.

00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And did
not feel safe enough

00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:18.310 align:middle line:84%
to share the impact of
John the Baptist or Jesus

00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:20.426 align:middle line:84%
because they were
both persecuted.

00:57:20.426 --> 00:57:21.550 align:middle line:90%
You were a man, by the way.

00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:23.170 align:middle line:90%
You were a man in that lifetime.

00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And you may have felt so
moved and touched and amazed.

00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:29.410 align:middle line:84%
But it was very
unsafe to share that.

00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:30.984 align:middle line:90%
So it became a walled city.

00:57:30.984 --> 00:57:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:57:31.900 --> 00:57:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And the
recurring dreams,

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:35.380 align:middle line:84%
recurring dreams are
just the unconscious

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:36.620 align:middle line:90%
knocking at your door.

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:37.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Trying to work it out.

00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yes.

00:57:38.370 --> 00:57:39.310 align:middle line:90%
And again and again.

00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Until you pay attention and
make some change in awareness

00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:45.970 align:middle line:84%
in waking life, it'll just
keep knocking at your door.

00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's so true.

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:49.300 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for that.

00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:51.666 align:middle line:84%
This isn't supposed to be a
personal session, but hey,

00:57:51.666 --> 00:57:54.040 align:middle line:84%
I love it, because I just put
a piece together for myself

00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:54.433 align:middle line:90%
that maybe people watching--

00:57:54.433 --> 00:57:54.826 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: I love it.

00:57:54.826 --> 00:57:55.626 align:middle line:90%
I'm so glad.

00:57:55.626 --> 00:57:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --are putting
their own pieces together

00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:59.470 align:middle line:84%
where they've been
through similar things.

00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: You know
what's delightful?

00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:03.370 align:middle line:10%
How quickly you put it together.

00:58:03.370 --> 00:58:07.300 align:middle line:10%
And by extension, I hope that
people looking at this program

00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:11.620 align:middle line:10%
or hearing it could also
generalize that I, too,

00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:15.170 align:middle line:10%
can understand some of my dreams
and make some connections very

00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:15.970 align:middle line:10%
easily.

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:17.920 align:middle line:90%
We are out of time.

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And we could go on for hours
just sharing and having fun.

00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:23.370 align:middle line:90%
You're just a blast to be with.

00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Thank you.

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:25.711 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've
done a beautiful job

00:58:25.711 --> 00:58:28.300 align:middle line:84%
of making your book very
practical and useful to people.

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:31.120 align:middle line:84%
So anyone that feels it's
time to start paying attention

00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:33.370 align:middle line:84%
to what's happening in the
other third of their lives,

00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:35.890 align:middle line:84%
I think you have a really
good guide for that.

00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:37.310 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Oh, thank you so much.

00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:39.160 align:middle line:84%
It was a pleasure
talking with you.

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:42.850 align:middle line:10%
You're so open and so welcoming.

00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:43.915 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:58:43.915 --> 00:58:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Doris.

00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: OK.

00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:45.730 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:58:45.730 --> 00:58:46.870 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again,
the name of the book

00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:49.180 align:middle line:10%
is "Dreaming on Both
Sides of the Brain," which

00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:51.810 align:middle line:10%
you can find at all major
booksellers, including Amazon,

00:58:51.810 --> 00:58:52.610 align:middle line:10%
of course.

00:58:52.610 --> 00:58:54.526 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:58:54.526 --> 00:58:55.570 align:middle line:10%
