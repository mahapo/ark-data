00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:29.670 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: There
are people who make history

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.770 align:middle line:10%
and people who record it.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.010 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes there
are people who do both.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.350 align:middle line:10%
One such man is Daniel Sheehan.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.240 align:middle line:84%
In our last
conversation with Danny,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.070 align:middle line:84%
we looked at his
profound influence

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.840 align:middle line:90%
in high profile legal cases.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And today, we begin a discussion
that few people in the world

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.420 align:middle line:90%
have ever been privy to.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.740 align:middle line:84%
We begin with the high stakes
political scene in the United

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.290 align:middle line:84%
States, and move on to
its seedy secret routes

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.150 align:middle line:90%
and how we evolved from there.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Good to have you back Danny.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>> DANIEL SHEEHAN:
Thank you Regina.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I've got to make
the standard disclaimer

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.830 align:middle line:90%
to everyone.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.370 align:middle line:84%
You have such
information rich stories

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.570 align:middle line:84%
that people need to
just sit back, relax,

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and go back and watch it a
second time and take notes, OK?

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Because you teach this
stuff, so I get it.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And this came from
a conversation

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.390 align:middle line:84%
we had in the studio last time
we recorded, looking at really

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.070 align:middle line:84%
what's at stake here
in the United States

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.200 align:middle line:84%
with this, what seems
to be insane scenario

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.230 align:middle line:90%
that's developed politically.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: The larger tactical
moment in which this logistical

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.810 align:middle line:84%
moment of the present
election takes place,

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.570 align:middle line:84%
the larger tactical moment
that we find ourselves

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.635 align:middle line:84%
in in American history is
the end of the Cold War.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And we're-- yes.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.093 align:middle line:10%
>> SHEEHAN: We're still in that.

00:01:45.093 --> 00:01:46.530 align:middle line:10%
We're still in that period.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.190 align:middle line:10%
Those of us who went through
the entire period, not

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.930 align:middle line:10%
just of the 45 year
Cold War, but really

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.470 align:middle line:10%
what was basically
a 75 year Cold War

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:10%
that began right with the
Bolshevik Revolution in 1917

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.790 align:middle line:10%
at the end of World
War I, all the way up

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.730 align:middle line:10%
to December 31st of 1991,
a 75 year period basically

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.620 align:middle line:10%
of the Cold War with
this confrontation

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.190 align:middle line:10%
between Western
democratic representative

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.710 align:middle line:10%
capitalism and the international
or global socialism,

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.280 align:middle line:10%
or communism, that that was the
fundamental dialectical dynamic

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.320 align:middle line:10%
that characterized
the Cold War ever

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.960 align:middle line:10%
since the Bolshevik Revolution.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And that came to an
end, functionally,

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.890 align:middle line:84%
on the last day of 1991 with
the voluntary dissolution

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.890 align:middle line:84%
of the Soviet Union, the
resignation of Gorbachev

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.130 align:middle line:84%
as the head of the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.720 align:middle line:84%
So that's the larger
tactical moment

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.840 align:middle line:84%
in which we find ourselves
in this election.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And this election is a pure
function of that moment.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.530 align:middle line:84%
At the conclusion
of the Cold War,

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.840 align:middle line:84%
the Democratic Party that had
been basically a liberal party

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.820 align:middle line:84%
consciously shifted through
the formation of a thing

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.320 align:middle line:84%
called the Democratic
Leadership Conference,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.170 align:middle line:84%
instigated by people
like Richard Gephardt

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.560 align:middle line:84%
in the Congress and
Bill Clinton and others,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.660 align:middle line:84%
these moderate Democrats,
that they turned away

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.700 align:middle line:84%
from a liberal agenda
that had characterized

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.950 align:middle line:84%
the Democratic Party under
Franklin Roosevelt and Truman

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.680 align:middle line:90%
and Kennedy earlier.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And they adopted
a set of policies

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.290 align:middle line:84%
that were a new, more
moderate set of policies.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.050 align:middle line:84%
They became, in
effect, Republicrats.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, more
ordered toward industry.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.970 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So that happened right at
the end of the Cold War.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for it was
because the Democratic Party

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:84%
had become a liberal
Democratic Party in response

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.710 align:middle line:90%
to the Bolshevik Revolution.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.940 align:middle line:84%
The Bolshevik Revolution was
challenging the previous robber

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.990 align:middle line:84%
baron world view that went on
from 1868 to 1898 in the United

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.830 align:middle line:84%
States, all the way up
to the First World War.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.410 align:middle line:84%
This was the ascendancy of
a corporate dominated world

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.407 align:middle line:84%
where the corporations began
to take over the government.

00:04:10.407 --> 00:04:11.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The corporatocracies.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.031 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: The corporatocracy.

00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And these major moguls
inside the corporate world

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.560 align:middle line:84%
dominated the policies of
the United States government.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.100 align:middle line:84%
They actually sent US
military expeditionary forces

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.590 align:middle line:84%
around the world, vanquishing
any kind of resistance

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.790 align:middle line:84%
to the corporations in South
America-- United Fruit--

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.440 align:middle line:90%
and around the world.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And the British, you know,
established major colonial

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.400 align:middle line:90%
powers over India.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.200 align:middle line:84%
The Dutch went into South Africa
and set up the Afrikaner regime

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.000 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.580 align:middle line:84%
That was the whole
operation that

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.630 align:middle line:84%
was going on during that
period of the late 19th century

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.260 align:middle line:90%
and early 20th century.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.900 align:middle line:84%
The Soviet Union rose up
in opposition to that,

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:84%
declaring that they were an
antipodal, antithesis force

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.780 align:middle line:84%
in the world to that type
of nation state based

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:84%
corporate capitalist
imperialism.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
dynamic that went on.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And it ran the
world for 75 years,

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.650 align:middle line:84%
that dialectical confrontation
between those two forces.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.170 align:middle line:84%
But with the Soviet
Union voluntarily

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.560 align:middle line:84%
abandoning the field
at the end of 1901,

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.250 align:middle line:84%
those same forces
that had generated

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.460 align:middle line:84%
that particular worldview
of corporate imperialism

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:84%
rose back to the fore
in the United States.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And immediately-- in
fact, the very first week

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.180 align:middle line:84%
after the voluntary dissolution
of the Soviet Union on December

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.840 align:middle line:84%
31st of 1991, there was a
meeting held in the George HW

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Bush White House that was
chaired by Dick Cheney,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.560 align:middle line:84%
his secretary of defense, and
Paul Wolfowitz, his deputy,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.590 align:middle line:90%
and others.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And they actually promulgated
a 1992 United States Defense

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Department policy planning
guidance document calling

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.010 align:middle line:84%
for not the reduction of
the US military budget

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.260 align:middle line:84%
now that the Soviet
Union had dissolved,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.270 align:middle line:84%
that had been the entire
rationale for this massive,

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.020 align:middle line:84%
at the time, $350 billion
dollar a year military budget.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.370 align:middle line:84%
They proposed, instead, that
we increase the military budget

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:16.780 align:middle line:90%
to $500 billion a year.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.296 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Pick a new enemy.

00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: Not
even a new enemy,

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.520 align:middle line:84%
but to establish full
spectrum dominance.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, OK, a
little more aggressive.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.080 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: That was the
actual term they used.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Wow, full
spectrum dominance.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: And the purpose
of it was to maintain

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.460 align:middle line:84%
the continued privileged access
to the strategic raw materials

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.590 align:middle line:84%
that were needed by the
American corporations.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.250 align:middle line:90%
And that was what they said.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.230 align:middle line:90%
That's what they wanted to do.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Now fortunately when the
first release of that

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.910 align:middle line:84%
happened on March 18th
of 1992, copies of that

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.520 align:middle line:84%
were circulated to a limited
number of men at the Pentagon,

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and to a limited number of
people inside the George HW

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.760 align:middle line:90%
Bush administration.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is in
New York-- or actually

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.530 align:middle line:84%
the "Washington Post" got
a hold of a copy of it.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And then they wrote a
major attack against it,

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.390 align:middle line:84%
saying this was a return
to gunboat diplomacy.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.980 align:middle line:84%
It was a return to the
robber baron mentality

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.100 align:middle line:84%
that characterized
that late 19th century

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:22.540 align:middle line:90%
and early 20th century.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.110 align:middle line:90%
And they condemned it.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And so what George
HW Bush did is

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.730 align:middle line:84%
he issued a unique
public statement

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.120 align:middle line:84%
about a classified document,
saying they didn't acknowledge

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.500 align:middle line:90%
that it even existed.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.020 align:middle line:84%
But if it did, it
was only a draft,

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.450 align:middle line:84%
and that they were going to redo
the 1992 United States Defense

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Department policy planning
guidance document.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.680 align:middle line:84%
So they actually prepared a
second classified document

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.110 align:middle line:84%
called "The Projection
of US Military Power Into

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.030 align:middle line:90%
the 21st Century and Beyond."

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was coauthored
by George HW Bush

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.780 align:middle line:84%
himself along with
Theodore Shackley, who

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.320 align:middle line:84%
was his director of covert
operations for the Central

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.560 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence Agency.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And what they proposed
in that is they

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.740 align:middle line:84%
wanted to pursue full
spectrum dominance.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.786 align:middle line:84%
But they wanted to do
it not unilaterally

00:08:06.786 --> 00:08:08.160 align:middle line:84%
on the part of
the United States,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.030 align:middle line:84%
but multilaterally
with a new alliance

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.515 align:middle line:84%
that they referred to as the new
northern industrial alliance,

00:08:14.515 --> 00:08:16.390 align:middle line:84%
and that that was going
to include the United

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:20.280 align:middle line:84%
States, Canada, the
Mexican government-- not

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.450 align:middle line:84%
the Mexican government run
by the indigenous people

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.960 align:middle line:84%
of Mexico, but run by the
PRI, which was the Castilian

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Spanish, the Causaians--
the United Kingdom,

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:34.760 align:middle line:84%
France, Spain, Italy, the new
reunified Germany-- this is all

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.880 align:middle line:84%
in the document,
classified document--

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:43.450 align:middle line:84%
and also invading Russia to join
now that Russia has spun off

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.962 align:middle line:90%
all of its ethnic provinces.

00:08:45.962 --> 00:08:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You've got
a white boy agenda.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: So what's you've
got is the full Caucasian

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.170 align:middle line:84%
governments, which was the exact
same objective that Hitler had.

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A lot of
people who say, well,

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't really care
about politics.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:57.870 align:middle line:90%
It's just a sham.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.670 align:middle line:90%
It's just a show.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.980 align:middle line:84%
But I think after
people listen to you,

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.680 align:middle line:84%
it's very clear why
we do have to know

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.630 align:middle line:84%
the underside of
politics, that that fabric

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:12.250 align:middle line:84%
is based on virtually
every black market.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Every administration has their
assassination teams in place,

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.090 align:middle line:84%
paid for out of black
ops money over people

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.830 align:middle line:84%
whose names we know well in
the intelligence agencies

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:22.910 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:27.890 align:middle line:84%
It's important to understand the
darkness of the paradigm that

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.740 align:middle line:84%
has been running that
show for so long,

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.590 align:middle line:84%
and then also look
at where we have

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:35.120 align:middle line:84%
little cracks, little
fissures in the system

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.900 align:middle line:84%
where a little light came
to surface for a short time.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Because if we get
this in our belly,

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.610 align:middle line:84%
we can get that the
need for systemic change

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.460 align:middle line:90%
has to happen through us.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.250 align:middle line:84%
That's why I love you
telling your story.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.510 align:middle line:84%
So do you want to start
back with your dad

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:53.590 align:middle line:84%
as a prison guard,
Lucky Luciano?

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:54.460 align:middle line:90%
Where do we start?

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.418 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's a big story.

00:09:55.418 --> 00:09:58.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to relax,
get out of your way.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.840 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: The challenge of
this type of discussion is

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.830 align:middle line:90%
where to begin.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And so what I want to do
is I want to, first of all,

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.540 align:middle line:84%
I want to point out that at
the very founding of the United

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.470 align:middle line:84%
States government, the
Constitution of the United

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:18.020 align:middle line:84%
States, you'll notice that
it was a compromise, that

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.840 align:middle line:84%
people all talk about
it was a compromise

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.620 align:middle line:84%
between the localists, the
state people and the colonies,

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:27.180 align:middle line:84%
and those who sponsored a
stronger federal government.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.270 align:middle line:84%
But there was a lot
more than that going on,

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:32.560 align:middle line:84%
that Madison and
Jefferson, who were

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.710 align:middle line:84%
responsible for
the Bill of Rights

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.460 align:middle line:84%
and the rights of individuals
and the kind of egalitarian

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.110 align:middle line:84%
nature of the Constitution
of all people being created

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle line:84%
equal, endowed by their creator
with certain unalienable rights

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.826 align:middle line:84%
and all of that, was a major
element in the partnership.

00:10:47.826 --> 00:10:49.450 align:middle line:84%
But the other
partnership was headed up

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.430 align:middle line:90%
by Alexander Hamilton.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.545 align:middle line:84%
Alexander Hamilton represented
the mercantilists--

00:10:53.545 --> 00:10:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The money--
yeah, the money.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: --the large
company owners, the banks,

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.780 align:middle line:90%
the financial institutions.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And they were an
elitist group that

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.860 align:middle line:84%
sympathized with the Royalist
view of leadership that

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.950 align:middle line:84%
had dominated all of Europe,
and continued to dominate Europe

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:11.450 align:middle line:84%
at the time of the founding of
the United States government.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.120 align:middle line:84%
So what you got was a
compromise between these two.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:84%
The United States Constitution
was not a pure document

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.100 align:middle line:90%
for egalitarian democracy.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.576 align:middle line:84%
For example, the people could
not vote for the president.

00:11:21.576 --> 00:11:23.950 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't even vote for
their United States senators.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:25.616 align:middle line:84%
All they could vote
for were the members

00:11:25.616 --> 00:11:28.960 align:middle line:84%
of the House of Representatives
and their local state

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.890 align:middle line:90%
legislature.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And the legislatures
would pick their senator.

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
also be involved

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.100 align:middle line:90%
in picking the president.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.540 align:middle line:84%
So that type of elitist
view is being reflected now

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.140 align:middle line:90%
that we see in the conventions.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.400 align:middle line:84%
We see the Republican
and Democratic Party

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.640 align:middle line:90%
has these superdelegates--

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: --who are all--

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very similar.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.973 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: And the media don't
want to talk about them a lot.

00:11:50.973 --> 00:11:55.920 align:middle line:84%
They say oh, let's have all the
people vote in the primaries,

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.600 align:middle line:84%
in the caucuses for who their
nominees are going to be.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.920 align:middle line:84%
But then when they see who
they're actually picking,

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.825 align:middle line:84%
if they don't adequately comport
with what the establishment--

00:12:03.825 --> 00:12:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right,
go get someone else.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.128 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: --party
wants, they'll insert

00:12:06.128 --> 00:12:08.700 align:middle line:84%
the superdelegates and
they'll change the rules

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.570 align:middle line:90%
and they'll pick somebody else.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
challenge that we see.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.230 align:middle line:84%
But this has been integral to
the United States government

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:17.530 align:middle line:90%
since its very founding.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And so you've always had these
mercantilists, these elitists,

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.230 align:middle line:84%
these financial elite that
from behind the scenes

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.930 align:middle line:84%
basically reach out and
control the policies,

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.320 align:middle line:84%
the foreign policies
and domestic policies.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:84%
This challenge went out all the
way to the American Civil War.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the
Civil War in 1868,

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.180 align:middle line:84%
the Northern industrialists
and the urban people

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.150 align:middle line:84%
and the financial
institutions, the East Coast

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:43.780 align:middle line:84%
financial institutions,
won the war.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
suppressed the other people,

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.550 align:middle line:84%
the more egalitarian, the
more rural, agrarian people.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
is from 1868 to 1898,

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.544 align:middle line:84%
that simply next 30
year period, we're

00:12:55.544 --> 00:12:57.210 align:middle line:84%
talking about a period
that's as short--

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Post-civil war, yeah.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: --as short as the
period from when Ronald Reagan

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.570 align:middle line:90%
was elected up until now right.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.880 align:middle line:84%
In that short 30 year
period, these people

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.370 align:middle line:84%
rose to take complete
control of the government,

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and that they were invading
the Hawaiian Islands, Guam.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.330 align:middle line:90%
They invaded Cuba.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.646 align:middle line:90%
They took over all of that area.

00:13:15.646 --> 00:13:18.410 align:middle line:84%
They engaged in
manifest destiny,

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.070 align:middle line:84%
taking over all the lands
from the indigenous people,

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.180 align:middle line:84%
the Native American
people on the continent.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.720 align:middle line:90%
They did that entire thing.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And they established themselves
as a major world power.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And since that
time, the people who

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.110 align:middle line:84%
are favoring the United
States being a world power

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.880 align:middle line:84%
have dominated the
American government.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a dark side
of the American government.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And they espouse all
these egalitarian,

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:48.120 align:middle line:84%
democratic, idealist
values, but in fact they

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.155 align:middle line:90%
don't practice them.

00:13:49.155 --> 00:13:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And they try to convince
us, for example,

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:54.520 align:middle line:84%
that when they're
invading Vietnam,

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.790 align:middle line:84%
in constructing a
completely fabricated

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:59.240 align:middle line:84%
South Vietnamese government
and saying oh, this

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.950 align:middle line:84%
is a struggle between
communism in the North

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.940 align:middle line:84%
and democracy in
the South, you know,

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.850 align:middle line:84%
it was a completely
fabricated government.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:06.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: They flew Ngo Dinh
Diem out of Columbia University

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:13.106 align:middle line:84%
and flew him and put him in
power in the South and said,

00:14:13.106 --> 00:14:14.730 align:middle line:84%
oh here, there's a
separate government.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And because the American
people aren't thoroughly

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:22.110 align:middle line:84%
educated politically,
we believed it.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was only
because of the rising

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.640 align:middle line:84%
of a generation-- back in that
time, the baby boom generation

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.230 align:middle line:84%
coming into college and
studying what was really

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.190 align:middle line:84%
happening in
Southeast Asia that we

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:34.844 align:middle line:90%
withdraw our support from them.

00:14:34.844 --> 00:14:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And there was this whole
period that we went through

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:38.020 align:middle line:90%
of challenging those people.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Where the
youth drove that.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:40.660 align:middle line:90%
They were so active in it, yes.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.285 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: The baby
boomer generation,

00:14:42.285 --> 00:14:45.510 align:middle line:84%
the 82 million people in the
baby boomer generation rose

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.760 align:middle line:84%
into political power,
challenged them.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.840 align:middle line:84%
They had the Senator Frank
Church and the Senate Select

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.696 align:middle line:84%
Committee on Intelligence
Abuse, investigated the CIA

00:14:53.696 --> 00:14:55.570 align:middle line:84%
and found out that they
were murdering people

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:58.050 align:middle line:84%
and assassinating
people and smuggling

00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.390 align:middle line:90%
drugs around the world.

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And this whole dark side
of the American government

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.380 align:middle line:84%
started to be brought
into the light.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:10.100 align:middle line:84%
But what happened is that these
darker element struck back.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:15.140 align:middle line:84%
In 1980, they basically ousted
the new idealistic president,

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Jimmy Carter, that had come in,
a wonderful guy, an honest guy,

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.230 align:middle line:84%
a guy that was cutting
off military funding

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.710 align:middle line:84%
to fascist dictators
around the world,

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.600 align:middle line:90%
cutting off US military support.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.480 align:middle line:84%
But these people struck back and
they actually put into power,

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.630 align:middle line:84%
not Ronald Reagan,
but George HW Bush.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:34.980 align:middle line:90%
That's who they put into power.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And he, from the
vice presidency,

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.580 align:middle line:84%
ran all the major
functions of government

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.410 align:middle line:84%
and had Ronald Reagan,
the professional actor,

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.440 align:middle line:90%
be onstage as the president.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.650 align:middle line:84%
But he was not really making any
of that fundamental decisions.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And we're in that
period right now,

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:52.857 align:middle line:84%
that dark period, of those
people that rose back

00:15:52.857 --> 00:15:53.940 align:middle line:90%
into a position of power--

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The ones
who are still alive.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: Dick Cheney.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They're still alive.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: I mean,
they're still alive.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.223 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're still
exerting influence.

00:16:00.223 --> 00:16:02.580 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's back up
a little bit from there

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.740 align:middle line:84%
because the earlier part
of the story is critical.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.490 align:middle line:90%


00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm fascinated with
the elements I really

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.610 align:middle line:84%
had no understanding
of until-- of course I

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:13.990 align:middle line:90%
never do until I speak to you.

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:18.400 align:middle line:84%
But let's go back
to the origins.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.910 align:middle line:84%
We talked a little
bit about Hitler

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.970 align:middle line:84%
and him being installed
by the banking industries

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:23.770 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: We'll let's start
right there began because that

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.730 align:middle line:84%
gets us to the end of World War
II and the prison and all that.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:31.950 align:middle line:84%
What happened that
people don't understand

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:36.340 align:middle line:84%
is that at the end of
World War I, when Germany

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:40.440 align:middle line:84%
rose up and tried to
establish hegemony in Europe,

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.820 align:middle line:84%
and the United States
stayed out of that war

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.280 align:middle line:90%
all the way up until 1917.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Actually the Soviet Union
had already-- the Bolsheviks

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:52.730 align:middle line:84%
had risen to power,
overthrown the tsar Alexander,

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:56.350 align:middle line:84%
and withdrew Russia from
World War I. It was only then

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.930 align:middle line:84%
the United States came
in and stopped Germany

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.610 align:middle line:90%
from taking over the whole area.

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:05.349 align:middle line:84%
But what happened is that in
the Versailles peace treaty that

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:09.740 align:middle line:84%
took place in 1918, that the
United States-- people have

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.869 align:middle line:84%
heard about this
part-- they inserted

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:15.690 align:middle line:84%
into the Treaty of Versailles
a reparations demand, making

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Germany pay
reparations for having

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:19.670 align:middle line:90%
undertaken an aggressive war.

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.819 align:middle line:84%
What that really
was, those provisions

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:25.290 align:middle line:84%
of the Versailles treaty
in 1900 were actually

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:29.640 align:middle line:84%
inserted into the treaty
by two young lawyers that

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.640 align:middle line:84%
were brought to the Treaty
of Versailles process

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.490 align:middle line:84%
by the then Secretary
of State Robert Lansing,

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.110 align:middle line:90%
under Woodrow Wilson.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:41.310 align:middle line:84%
His nephews, two nephews, Allen
Dulles and John Foster Dulles,

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:44.320 align:middle line:84%
who were attorneys in the law
firm of Sullivan & Cromwell

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.220 align:middle line:84%
on Wall Street, were
brought into that,

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.850 align:middle line:84%
and they drafted into
the Treaty of Versailles

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.690 align:middle line:84%
these reparations
demands that demanded

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.290 align:middle line:84%
that the German government
pay billions of dollars

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:59.640 align:middle line:84%
in reparations to a number of
companies whose property they

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.560 align:middle line:90%
confiscated and had destroyed.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.440 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that
those people who

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.450 align:middle line:84%
were demanding the reparations
were all private investment

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:09.260 align:middle line:84%
clients of Brown Brothers
Harriman, a private investment

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.060 align:middle line:90%
firm.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.772 align:middle line:84%
Allen Dulles was
the legal counsel--

00:18:11.772 --> 00:18:12.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It was a conflict.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.271 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: --for those people.

00:18:14.271 --> 00:18:16.960 align:middle line:84%
A total conflict, but no
one was there to enforce it.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.519 align:middle line:84%
And so what he
did is he inserted

00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:21.060 align:middle line:84%
into the Treaty of Versailles,
he and his brother John Foster

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.187 align:middle line:84%
Dulles, these
reparations demands

00:18:23.187 --> 00:18:25.520 align:middle line:84%
that were paying the money
back to the clients for Brown

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.320 align:middle line:90%
Brothers Harriman.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And so Germany,
which had nothing,

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.170 align:middle line:84%
had to borrow in
order to get that.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And the loans that
were given to Germany

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.940 align:middle line:84%
were given by other
business investment

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.810 align:middle line:84%
clients of Brown Brothers
Harriman, all of whom

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:41.530 align:middle line:84%
the lawyer of whom
was Allen Dulles.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And Allen Dulles had become
the lawyer for Germany.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:48.210 align:middle line:84%
So he actually
negotiated these loans

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.560 align:middle line:84%
that were going to
Germany, rebuilding

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.000 align:middle line:84%
the massive military
power of Germany,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.722 align:middle line:84%
because these people wanted to,
in fact, to rebuild Germany--

00:18:57.722 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Industry--
the industry.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: --German
industry and their military,

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.520 align:middle line:84%
to become the bulwark
against Bolshevism in Europe.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And the chairman of the board
of Brown Brothers Harriman,

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:13.700 align:middle line:84%
or the chief executive officer,
was George Herbert Walker,

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:17.500 align:middle line:84%
the grandfather of George
Herbert Walker Bush, George HW

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.300 align:middle line:90%
Bush.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.610 align:middle line:84%
That was his grandfather,
his maternal grandfather.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And what they did
is they started

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.250 align:middle line:84%
giving these loans to
Germany, paying money back

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.490 align:middle line:84%
to pay the reparations
of their other clients,

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:90%
and building up the military.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And then what they
did is in 1924,

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.980 align:middle line:84%
George Herbert
Walker stepped out

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.810 align:middle line:84%
as the CEO of Brown
Brothers Harriman, appointed

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:44.370 align:middle line:84%
his son-in-law, Prescott Bush,
to be the new CEO of Brown

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:45.330 align:middle line:90%
Brothers Harriman.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And George Herbert
Walker set up a bank

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.260 align:middle line:84%
called the Union
Bank of New York,

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.040 align:middle line:90%
which began to give loans.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.520 align:middle line:84%
They set up a subsidiary in
the Netherlands called the Bank

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.820 align:middle line:90%
of Commerce and Shipping.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And they transferred
funds there and built

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:02.230 align:middle line:84%
the national headquarters
for the Nazi party.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And they actually begin
to fund the Nazi party

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.800 align:middle line:90%
and brought Hitler to power.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And actually on
January 3rd of 1933,

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.250 align:middle line:84%
there was a meeting held
deciding whether or not

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:15.635 align:middle line:84%
Hitler would be made the
chancellor of Germany.

00:20:15.635 --> 00:20:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And in the meeting was John
Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles.

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And they extracted
an agreement from him

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:23.970 align:middle line:84%
that he would continue
to pay off the loans

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:25.580 align:middle line:90%
and he would be made chancellor.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.840 align:middle line:84%
That's how Hitler rose
to power in Germany.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it's just to
underscore the notion that

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.770 align:middle line:90%
there is no morality.

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:39.010 align:middle line:84%
There are no ethics when
it comes to the money guys,

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:40.799 align:middle line:90%
in terms of who they loan to.

00:20:40.799 --> 00:20:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: Corporations.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.256 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They were loaning
to both sides the whole time.

00:20:44.256 --> 00:20:47.557 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: Well no, they're
not loaning to the Russians.

00:20:47.557 --> 00:20:48.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, not the Russians.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:49.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about--

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.005 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: They were
loaning to the Germans.

00:20:51.005 --> 00:20:52.171 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The Germans, yes.

00:20:52.171 --> 00:20:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: And there were no
two sides at that side except

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:56.810 align:middle line:84%
for the Bolsheviks
and the fascists.

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, I hear
what you're saying.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: What
happened is that--

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But this
was Wall Street.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: This
was Wall Street.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Wall Street, they
were implicated in that.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.228 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: Well
very specifically,

00:21:04.228 --> 00:21:08.080 align:middle line:84%
it was the Wall Street law
firm of Sullivan & Cromwell,

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.655 align:middle line:84%
with the senior partners of
which became Allen Dulles

00:21:10.655 --> 00:21:14.240 align:middle line:84%
and John Foster
Dulles, and others,

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.040 align:middle line:84%
such as Robert Lovett and a guy
by the name of Robert Anderson,

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.550 align:middle line:84%
that they were the
senior partners.

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:21.930 align:middle line:84%
But they were funding
the rise of Hitler

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:25.260 align:middle line:84%
to be the bulwark against
Bolshevism in Europe.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is when
Hitler rose to power,

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and like this fear that we
said got out of control,

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.140 align:middle line:84%
came out from under the
control of those people,

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.100 align:middle line:84%
and he was trying to get the
United States and England

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.740 align:middle line:90%
to join in a Caucasian alliance.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.741 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: See, now most
people don't know that.

00:21:41.741 --> 00:21:42.823 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: But it's true.

00:21:42.823 --> 00:21:44.240 align:middle line:90%
That's what he was trying to do.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And when the United
States didn't,

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:49.590 align:middle line:84%
because Franklin Roosevelt had
become elected, by that time.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Roosevelt was elected in
1932, and he did not support

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:56.320 align:middle line:90%
entering into an alliance.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.240 align:middle line:84%
If in fact the Republicans
had won in 1932,

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.240 align:middle line:84%
if Hoover had stayed
in power, they

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.227 align:middle line:84%
would have joined into
an alliance with them.

00:22:04.227 --> 00:22:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And they would have refused
to come into World War

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.750 align:middle line:90%
II against Germany.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:09.490 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
is was Roosevelt

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:12.180 align:middle line:84%
came into positions of
power, and he was resisting

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.510 align:middle line:90%
joining in the alliance.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And so these very people
that I'm talking about,

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:19.210 align:middle line:84%
the private investment clients
of Brown Brothers Harriman,

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:24.070 align:middle line:84%
they tried to mount a military
coup against Roosevelt, which

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:25.710 align:middle line:90%
nobody wants to talk about.

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Nobody talks about
it in high schools.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:28.820 align:middle line:84%
They don't teach
about in college.

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:35.640 align:middle line:84%
1934, the chief of staff of
JP Morgan, a guy by the name

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.260 align:middle line:90%
of-- I can't think of his name.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, they started trying
to organize a military coup

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.580 align:middle line:90%
against Roosevelt.

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And they tried to recruit the
commandant, the United States

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Marine Corps, Major
General Smedley Butler,

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:53.590 align:middle line:84%
to actually lead a
military coup against him

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.930 align:middle line:84%
so that they could keep the
United States from entering

00:22:55.930 --> 00:23:00.330 align:middle line:84%
into the war against Germany,
as Germany then began to move

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and eventually invaded Poland
and the Sudetenland and invaded

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:08.500 align:middle line:84%
France and were marching down
the Champs-Elysees firebombing

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:12.000 align:middle line:84%
England, and the United States
still hadn't gone into the war.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.320 align:middle line:84%
It was primarily because of
these major financial interests

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.170 align:middle line:84%
stopping the United States
from coming into the war.

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, add the piece
about Hitler then backing

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:22.540 align:middle line:90%
Japan.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: Well what happened
is when England and the United

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:30.860 align:middle line:84%
States would not join in, what
happened is the United States,

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.450 align:middle line:84%
the deal that Hitler
was offering to England

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:38.080 align:middle line:84%
and the United States was to
have Germany run all of Europe

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.370 align:middle line:84%
under a fascist form of
government that combined

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:45.670 align:middle line:84%
the corporations and the state,
where the state would subsidize

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:48.760 align:middle line:84%
the corporations and the
corporations would produce all

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.780 align:middle line:84%
the materials that were needed
for a major military state.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And the owners of the
stock of the corporations

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:56.789 align:middle line:84%
would continue to get
the private profits.

00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to
have the same kind

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:00.040 align:middle line:90%
of regime in the United States.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:03.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact Henry Luce, who owned
"Time" magazine and "Life"

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:07.450 align:middle line:84%
magazine and "Fortune" magazine
and several others, that

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:11.500 align:middle line:84%
from 1924 to 1934,
he actually put

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:15.400 align:middle line:84%
onto the cover eight of
his different publications

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.610 align:middle line:90%
Hitler and Mussolini and Franco.

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.605 align:middle line:84%
And they were openly
advocating fascism.

00:24:22.605 --> 00:24:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this was the most
popular magazine of the day,

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:27.630 align:middle line:84%
"Life" magazine,
"Time," "Fortune."

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:30.296 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: The most widely-read
magazines that they were openly

00:24:30.296 --> 00:24:31.110 align:middle line:90%
advocating fascism.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:33.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact Henry Luce
wrote an essay,

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:36.240 align:middle line:84%
or an editorial,
in "Time" magazine

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:41.520 align:middle line:84%
in 1941 called "The
American Century,"

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.240 align:middle line:84%
calling openly for the US
not to go to war in Europe

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.700 align:middle line:84%
against Germany, allow Germany
to take complete control

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:52.760 align:middle line:84%
of the area, but to turn our
attention toward the Pacific

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.874 align:middle line:84%
and toward Asia, to open
up all those markets

00:24:55.874 --> 00:24:56.790 align:middle line:90%
for our corporations--

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:57.665 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Resources.

00:24:57.665 --> 00:25:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: --and let
that be what we did.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
what the plan was.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:06.120 align:middle line:84%
But Roosevelt kept sticking
his thumb in this plan.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And what Roosevelt
did is, in fact,

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:15.830 align:middle line:84%
is he instigated an attack
against Pearl Harbor,

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:19.220 align:middle line:84%
because he was moving
into Asia and Japan

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:23.300 align:middle line:84%
wanted to be the dominant force
in Asia, the imperial power.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.420 align:middle line:90%
They'd invaded China.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:29.230 align:middle line:84%
They had huge forces
going into Southeast Asia.

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And in this financial group
that we're talking about

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.950 align:middle line:84%
was trying to maintain
control over the area.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.050 align:middle line:84%
They were in fact
financing, secretly,

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.090 align:middle line:84%
the shipping of
weapons into China

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:42.630 align:middle line:84%
to support the Kuomintang, the
so-called nationalist Chinese.

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:44.280 align:middle line:90%
And they were supporting them.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:48.925 align:middle line:84%
Henry Luce and Claire Boothe
Luce set up the Flying Tigers.

00:25:48.925 --> 00:25:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And they were flying,
you know, Terry--

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Military contracts.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: They were doing
this completely privately to try

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.100 align:middle line:84%
to maintain their
foothold in the East.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.800 align:middle line:90%
That's what was happening.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is
Roosevelt, eventually, he

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.370 align:middle line:84%
moved all the US
aircraft carriers

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:10.020 align:middle line:84%
and all of our major destroyers
into Pearl Harbor at one time.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It was
that provoking?

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.200 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: Oh absolutely.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There was
a pure provocation?

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.038 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: Absolutely.

00:26:14.038 --> 00:26:17.000 align:middle line:84%
He was doing it to try to lure
the Japanese into attacking

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Pearl Harbor so that he
could get the American public

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:21.580 align:middle line:84%
to resist the pressure
that was being put

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.180 align:middle line:84%
on by these major fans of
fascism in the United States

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.934 align:middle line:84%
and get them to
come into the war.

00:26:26.934 --> 00:26:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And so what he did is he put
all of the aircraft carriers,

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:31.815 align:middle line:84%
all the destroyers into
Pearl Harbor at one time.

00:26:31.815 --> 00:26:32.615 align:middle line:90%
And the Japanese--

00:26:32.615 --> 00:26:34.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Painted a big
red flag on it, yeah.

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: And then what he
did is two days before they

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.730 align:middle line:84%
arrived, he moved the aircraft
carriers out of Pearl Harbor,

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:43.890 align:middle line:84%
before they could know it, under
the cover of darkness actually.

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And so they weren't
there when they attacked.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And so there were a lot
of other battleships

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:52.055 align:middle line:84%
that were there that were
basically antiquated.

00:26:52.055 --> 00:26:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
mothball fleets.

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: Right.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.691 align:middle line:84%
And those are the people
that got attacked.

00:26:55.691 --> 00:26:59.070 align:middle line:84%
But he was willing to sacrifice
hundreds of US military people

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:00.840 align:middle line:84%
that were killed in
that attack in order

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.960 align:middle line:84%
to mobilize the
American people to get

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.560 align:middle line:90%
them to enter into the war.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And you need to remember-- most
people don't realize this--

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:10.310 align:middle line:84%
the United States
government never

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:13.880 align:middle line:90%
declared war on Germany, never.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.170 align:middle line:84%
What they did is they
declared war on Japan,

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.130 align:middle line:84%
after they were attacked,
and then Germany

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:20.020 align:middle line:84%
declared war on
the United States

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.930 align:middle line:84%
because they were
an ally of Japan.

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:23.790 align:middle line:84%
Because when the
United States refused

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:26.290 align:middle line:84%
to come into the
alliance with Germany,

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Hitler established an
alliance with Japan,

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:33.020 align:middle line:84%
to try to head off the
United States from being

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.300 align:middle line:90%
able to go into Asia.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.120 align:middle line:90%
So that's what was happening.

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And so it's important
to understand

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.210 align:middle line:84%
that those alliances
were all in place

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:43.190 align:middle line:90%
before World War II began.

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is
that the financing

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.780 align:middle line:84%
of the rise of Hitler into
power, by Brown Brothers

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Harriman financial clients,
the Union Bank of New York,

00:27:53.090 --> 00:28:00.920 align:middle line:84%
the Bank of Commerce and
Shipping in Netherlands,

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:05.960 align:middle line:84%
that whole group, they in fact
continued to fund Germany even

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.850 align:middle line:90%
after the war was going on.

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:09.071 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: From 1941, '42--

00:28:09.071 --> 00:28:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's just so slimy.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: --they continues
to fund them because they

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:16.190 align:middle line:84%
supported him, not Roosevelt.
And what happened is they were

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:19.470 align:middle line:90%
exposed by Smedley Butler.

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened is a
congressional hearing was held.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And they ordered
the confiscation

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:27.720 align:middle line:84%
of the assets of some
of these companies.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And the owners of
those companies

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.390 align:middle line:84%
hired Allen Dulles
to be their lawyer

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:36.870 align:middle line:84%
to hide their assets so they
wouldn't get confiscated.

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then also
to bump off any competition

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.120 align:middle line:90%
as the years went one.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: So the bottom line
is that World War II went on.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.650 align:middle line:84%
We come to the end of
World War II, 1945.

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:51.160 align:middle line:84%
The United States drops the
bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.410 align:middle line:90%
and the war comes to an end.

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is immediately
the head of anti-Soviet

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and anti-Eastern Bloc
intelligence for the Third

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Reich, Nazi Major
General Reinhard Gehlen

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:06.490 align:middle line:84%
turns himself in to the
101st Counter Intelligence

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Corps in Germany and
offers his services

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.310 align:middle line:84%
to the United States as
the chief of intelligence

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:18.280 align:middle line:84%
against the Soviet Union, and
brings in all of his allies

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.920 align:middle line:90%
and gets an agreement struck.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.210 align:middle line:84%
He gets an agreement
struck through--

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:25.040 align:middle line:84%
he was assigned a translator by
the 101st Counter Intelligence

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Corps, a young man by the
name of Theodore Shackley who

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.810 align:middle line:84%
was born in Germany and
came to the United States

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:36.520 align:middle line:84%
before World War II, and
entered the United States Army.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Because of his language
skills in Polish and German,

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.090 align:middle line:84%
he was put into the 101st
Counter Intelligence

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:42.490 align:middle line:90%
Corps in Germany.

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And so when Reinhard Gehlen the
Nazi anti-Soviet specialist,

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:50.590 align:middle line:84%
turned himself into the 101st
Counter Intelligence Corps,

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Theodore Shackley was
assigned to be his translator.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:56.807 align:middle line:84%
And Gehlen offered his
services to the Western allies.

00:29:56.807 --> 00:29:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we've heard
of this in other communities,

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:03.040 align:middle line:84%
because this was an influx
of intelligentsia of Germany,

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:03.995 align:middle line:90%
the scientists.

00:30:03.995 --> 00:30:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: Well
the scientists--

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:07.180 align:middle line:84%
two different programs
were established.

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right,
that's Paperclip.

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:10.118 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: The one,
Operation Paperclip,

00:30:10.118 --> 00:30:13.250 align:middle line:84%
the rocket scientists were
all brought over to the United

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:17.390 align:middle line:84%
States to develop rockets, and
to deprive the Soviet Union

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:18.350 align:middle line:90%
of as many of those.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:21.480 align:middle line:84%
But there was an additional
program, Operation Overcast,

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:26.230 align:middle line:84%
which is the anti-Soviet
spies all throughout Europe

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:27.400 align:middle line:90%
and Eastern Europe.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.410 align:middle line:84%
They were all under the
control of Reinhard Gehlen.

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And so what Reinhard
Gehlen agreed to do

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.130 align:middle line:84%
is that if the
United States would

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:38.220 align:middle line:84%
agree to take Reinhard Gehlen's
name off the Nuremberg war

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:41.900 align:middle line:84%
crime tribunal list,
and his hundred top men,

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.330 align:middle line:84%
that they would agree
to function on behalf

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:46.380 align:middle line:84%
of the Western
allies, and to have

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Rainer Gehlen made the new head
of West German intelligence.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:51.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he did.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And his deputy was
Theodore Shackley.

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:58.470 align:middle line:84%
A United States citizen was
his deputy, and stayed there.

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And that was what happened
at the end of World War II.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is that,
also, the leadership of the SS

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.810 align:middle line:84%
and the major Nazi party, they
realized that the war was lost,

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and so they began to
secretly ship people out,

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:17.656 align:middle line:84%
the leadership of the Nazi
party, out of Germany.

00:31:17.656 --> 00:31:19.030 align:middle line:84%
But with the United
States coming

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:22.870 align:middle line:84%
in with the invasion
in June 6, 1944,

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:26.200 align:middle line:84%
and the Russians were
invading from the east,

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.890 align:middle line:84%
and as they were
closing in on Germany,

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:30.120 align:middle line:90%
these guys all started fleeing.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And they fled down
to Argentina and--

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Brazil, all, yeah.

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:35.000 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: --and
Paraguay and Brazil.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And they all fled down
there with the support

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.880 align:middle line:84%
of Pope Pius XII, who was
also a fascist, the guy who

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:47.750 align:middle line:84%
signed the concordat with
Mussolini and Franco and Hitler

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:51.200 align:middle line:84%
to not oppose the
Nazis in World War II,

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.030 align:middle line:84%
in exchange for which they were
given custody of the Vatican

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:57.330 align:middle line:90%
state, by Mussolini.

00:31:57.330 --> 00:31:59.940 align:middle line:90%
So all of that was going on.

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And so what we saw was
that the leadership

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:04.610 align:middle line:84%
of the entire
fascist organization

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:06.720 align:middle line:90%
shifted down to South America.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And the financial
circles of people

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.290 align:middle line:84%
that helped finance
their rise to power

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:13.890 align:middle line:84%
continued their
alliance with them.

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And that thing has continued
at the end of World War II.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is that--
it's a long and involved story--

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:24.110 align:middle line:84%
but the bottom line is there was
discovered in the Philippines

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:29.380 align:middle line:84%
a whole buried set of treasure
that General Yamashita

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:33.760 align:middle line:84%
had been pilfering from all
of Asia on behalf of Japan

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.570 align:middle line:84%
under a thing called
the Golden Lily Project.

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And they were stealing
gold and platinum

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.594 align:middle line:90%
and diamonds and rubies.

00:32:39.594 --> 00:32:40.510 align:middle line:90%
And they brought them.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And when they knew
the United States was

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:45.690 align:middle line:84%
going to be invading Japan, they
secretly shipped them all out

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:47.430 align:middle line:84%
to the Philippines
and buried them

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:54.780 align:middle line:84%
in 176 different troves, each
of which contained $100 billion.

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that the G2, the head

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:59.540 align:middle line:84%
of US military intelligence
in the Philippines

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:01.870 align:middle line:84%
at the end of World
War II, a fellow

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:08.330 align:middle line:84%
named Edward Lansdale tortured
the driver of General Yamashita

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:10.900 align:middle line:84%
to find out where some
of these buried treasures

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:15.760 align:middle line:84%
were, recovered 12 of them,
$1.2 trillion in them.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And they used this as
a secret trove of money

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:22.370 align:middle line:84%
under the control of
Brown Brothers Harriman,

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:24.880 align:middle line:84%
actually the two
major senior partners

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.950 align:middle line:84%
are Robert Lovett and
Robert B. Anderson.

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's quite a trust.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: That's
quite a trust.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.268 align:middle line:84%
And what they did is
they used that money

00:33:31.268 --> 00:33:35.230 align:middle line:84%
at the end of World War
II to suppress the rise

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:36.910 align:middle line:84%
into positions of
power of people

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:38.590 align:middle line:90%
who were part of the partisans.

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:41.540 align:middle line:84%
All in Europe that
fought the Nazis.

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.760 align:middle line:84%
They suppressed
their rise to power

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:48.220 align:middle line:84%
and financed the rise to power
of Nazis, and Nazi supporters,

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:51.090 align:middle line:84%
so that you got these fascist
governments all around

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:54.900 align:middle line:84%
in Europe at the end of
World War II under the Truman

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.450 align:middle line:90%
Doctrine.

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And what they said is,
the Truman Doctrine,

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:03.050 align:middle line:84%
we cannot allow the reins of
power to fall into the hands

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:06.230 align:middle line:84%
of communists or socialists
even if it is the will

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:08.120 align:middle line:90%
of the majority of their people.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And so what they did is they
suppressed those people,

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.050 align:middle line:84%
raised up for governors
and mayors of cities

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:17.230 align:middle line:84%
and stuff the actual
supporters of Nazis.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:18.770 align:middle line:90%
And they put them into power.

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And that whole thing went on
under the Truman Doctrine.

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:23.050 align:middle line:90%
And we began this process.

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:25.260 align:middle line:84%
We set up the Central
Intelligence Agency.

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:27.350 align:middle line:84%
The Central Intelligence
Agency was set up

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:30.080 align:middle line:84%
by these same
financial services.

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And the first civilian
chairman was Allen Dulles.

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Allen Dulles
again, director of the CIA--

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.469 align:middle line:84%
now once he was into
that position as director

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:43.620 align:middle line:84%
of the CIA, let's talk about how
things start spinning from that

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:44.620 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:48.449 align:middle line:84%
We're going to start
moving into JFK.

00:34:48.449 --> 00:34:50.710 align:middle line:90%
We're going to move into Cuba.

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And everything that was
playing out at that time,

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.969 align:middle line:90%
a lot of boomers will remember.

00:34:54.969 --> 00:34:57.810 align:middle line:84%
But what was really going on,
the underbelly of that time?

00:34:57.810 --> 00:34:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Well what happened is that
at the end of World War II,

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:08.210 align:middle line:84%
this new regime
basically came in,

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:15.350 align:middle line:84%
because Franklin Roosevelt
died on April 12th of 1945

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:19.040 align:middle line:90%
and Truman came into office.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And these forces
that were mobilizing

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:25.720 align:middle line:84%
at the end of World War II,
bringing Gehlen in and agreeing

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.450 align:middle line:84%
that he'd be the head of
intelligence for the West

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:30.520 align:middle line:84%
German government,
that they would have

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.360 align:middle line:84%
him be the primary
source of intelligence

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:35.190 align:middle line:84%
against the Soviet Union,
that they would have

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:38.740 align:middle line:84%
this trust, this
Anderson trust of money

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:40.439 align:middle line:90%
to be raising fascists--

00:35:40.439 --> 00:35:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We didn't give
a name to it last time.

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.563 align:middle line:84%
That's the booty that they
had in the Philippines.

00:35:44.563 --> 00:35:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: Well here's
exactly what happened.

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:51.350 align:middle line:84%
What happened is that
there was some information

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:54.800 align:middle line:84%
around suspecting that the
Japanese government had

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.540 align:middle line:84%
moved some significant
amounts of treasure

00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:58.900 align:middle line:90%
into the Philippines.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And when the end
of the war came,

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:05.510 align:middle line:84%
this fellow by the name
of Edward Lansdale, who

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:07.780 align:middle line:84%
was the G2 in the
Philippines, now

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.650 align:middle line:84%
the head of intelligence,
Army Intelligence.

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:15.880 align:middle line:84%
He captured, and when General
Yamashita turned himself in,

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:19.170 align:middle line:84%
who had been the supervisor
of burying these treasures,

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:22.870 align:middle line:84%
that Lansdale
captured his driver.

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And Lansdale assigned a guy
by the name of Santa Romano

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:30.420 align:middle line:84%
to torture the guy, to
try to find out where

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.030 align:middle line:90%
some of these troves were.

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And through the torture
sessions, some of which

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Lansdale actually
personally witnessed,

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:43.160 align:middle line:84%
they extracted this information
for 12 of these troves.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And what Lansdale did,
they opened up two of them

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:48.030 align:middle line:84%
and found that there
was $100 billion

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:53.400 align:middle line:84%
of gold bullion,
platinum, silver,

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:57.530 align:middle line:90%
and jewels in these troves.

00:36:57.530 --> 00:37:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And so Lansdale actually
flew to Hong Kong,

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:07.340 align:middle line:84%
and flew eventually
to Singapore I

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:10.730 align:middle line:84%
believe, and met directly
with General MacArthur, who

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:14.960 align:middle line:84%
was the commander of the East,
the whole Pacific at the time,

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and told him that
they had found these.

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:19.380 align:middle line:90%
And there were 176 of these.

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.810 align:middle line:90%
They uncovered 12 of them.

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:22.610 align:middle line:90%
And they had--

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:23.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: $1.2 trillion.

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: --$1.2 trillion
already in possession.

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:26.751 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A lot of
money in the day.

00:37:26.751 --> 00:37:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: So what MacArthur
did is he brought his G2

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:34.070 align:middle line:84%
into the meeting, a guide
named Charles Willoughby.

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And Charles Willoughby
and Lansdale

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:39.450 align:middle line:84%
flew in MacArthur's
private plane

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:44.610 align:middle line:84%
back to back to the Philippines,
back to Hawaii, back

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:47.240 align:middle line:84%
to the United States, all
the way to Washington, DC

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:49.370 align:middle line:84%
To have a private
meeting with Truman

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:51.470 align:middle line:84%
to let him know that they
had come into possession

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:54.825 align:middle line:84%
of these $1.2 trillion in
gold and silver, platinum

00:37:54.825 --> 00:37:55.870 align:middle line:90%
and jewels.

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And they had to get
through the chief of staff

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:00.880 align:middle line:90%
first to get a meeting.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:03.270 align:middle line:84%
The chief of staff
was Clark Clifford.

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:05.180 align:middle line:84%
So they had to tell
them what they had.

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:07.640 align:middle line:84%
So Clark Clifford set up
the meeting with Truman.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And when they started to tell
Truman what they had uncovered,

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Truman brought into the meeting
Stimson, his secretary of war.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And Stimson brought
in with him two

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:20.220 align:middle line:84%
of his deputies-- well
three of his deputies,

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:24.170 align:middle line:84%
who were Robert Lovett-- who
was a senior partner at Brown

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:25.830 align:middle line:90%
Brothers Harriman.

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And Robert Anderson was a
senior partner in Brown Brothers

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.500 align:middle line:90%
Harriman-- and John Jay McCloy.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And they assigned them to be the
three trustees of this trust.

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.180 align:middle line:84%
They did not tell the
Congress about it.

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:41.420 align:middle line:84%
They did not take the funds into
possession of the government.

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:43.060 align:middle line:84%
They kept it outside
the government

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:44.434 align:middle line:84%
so they wouldn't
have to report--

00:38:44.434 --> 00:38:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Some kinds of
black ops, off the books cash.

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:48.666 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: It was an
off the books operation.

00:38:48.666 --> 00:38:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And they assigned Robert
Anderson and Lovett and McCloy

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:53.990 align:middle line:84%
to be the trustees for
this, with the understanding

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:57.720 align:middle line:84%
that they were going to be
financing the rise of, quote,

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:02.633 align:middle line:84%
sympathetic candidates around
the world to support capitalism

00:39:02.633 --> 00:39:03.433 align:middle line:90%
against communism.

00:39:03.433 --> 00:39:06.010 align:middle line:90%


00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:09.150 align:middle line:84%
So they had set up this
regime of having access

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:10.590 align:middle line:90%
to these funds.

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:13.430 align:middle line:84%
They adopted the Truman
Doctrine publicly

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:15.520 align:middle line:84%
of not allowing any
of these governments

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.580 align:middle line:84%
to fall into the hands of
socialists or communists.

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.340 align:middle line:84%
So they put them
under the control

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.860 align:middle line:84%
of these people that
were anti-communist

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:26.220 align:middle line:84%
which meant they were
pro-fascist for the most part.

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And that whole
regime was in place.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And so what they did is they
proposed-- the elite people

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:36.566 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about, Robert
Lovett, proposed to Truman

00:39:36.566 --> 00:39:41.700 align:middle line:84%
that they establish a Central
Intelligence group that

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:44.950 align:middle line:84%
would basically have the
power of covert operations

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:48.040 align:middle line:84%
that could help facilitate
and run this secret program

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:49.600 align:middle line:90%
they were going to be running.

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.290 align:middle line:84%
So Lovett headed up a
commission recommending

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:55.430 align:middle line:84%
the creation of a Central
Intelligence Agency.

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:58.920 align:middle line:90%
And they set it up in 1947.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And they set up the Central
Intelligence Agency.

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
provision, section 5412

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:11.250 align:middle line:84%
of the National
Security Act of 1947

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:13.980 align:middle line:84%
which authorized the
National Security

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Council to not only engage
in gathering intelligence,

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:20.370 align:middle line:84%
the Central Intelligence
Agency to gather and evaluate

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:23.900 align:middle line:84%
intelligence, but also,
from time to time,

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.070 align:middle line:84%
undertake other
assignments assigned

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:28.170 align:middle line:84%
to them by the National
Security Council.

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was under the color
of that particular provision

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:35.580 align:middle line:84%
that they set up the 5412
committee, which ended up

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:41.420 align:middle line:84%
being chaired, as of 1952,
with the election of Eisenhower

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:45.390 align:middle line:84%
and his vice president
Richard Nixon-- Richard

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Nixon was assigned to
chair the 5412 committee.

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:50.540 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
power of Richard Nixon

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:51.840 align:middle line:90%
really begins to arrive.

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Tell us about
the 5412 committee.

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:55.371 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: The 5412
committees is a subcommittee

00:40:55.371 --> 00:40:57.340 align:middle line:84%
of the National
Security Council.

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:59.200 align:middle line:84%
The National Security
Council is made up

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.910 align:middle line:84%
of the secretary of state,
the secretary of defense,

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:06.900 align:middle line:84%
the secretary of the
treasury, and the heads of all

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:11.620 align:middle line:84%
of the military commands-- the
Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps.

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.500 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have an
Air Force at that time,

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:15.520 align:middle line:90%
but they had the Army Air Force.

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And this became the
Security Council.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And they set up a special
subdivision, the 5412

00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:25.180 align:middle line:84%
committee, where
the CIA-- which was

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.605 align:middle line:90%
not a military organization.

00:41:26.605 --> 00:41:31.340 align:middle line:84%
It was a civilian intelligence
organization and a gathering

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:33.850 align:middle line:90%
and evaluation group.

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:37.320 align:middle line:84%
But what they did is because
of this section under 5412

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.570 align:middle line:84%
that authorized them to
engage in specific activities

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:44.620 align:middle line:84%
from time to time, what
happened is Richard Nixon began

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:48.590 align:middle line:84%
to assert power to
use the CIA to engage

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:52.230 align:middle line:84%
in covert operations, active
paramilitary operations.

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now the
CIA at that time,

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:56.480 align:middle line:84%
just so we can
get this straight,

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.264 align:middle line:84%
they were funded by
that Anderson trust?

00:41:59.264 --> 00:42:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: No, they had their
own funding from the United

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:02.240 align:middle line:90%
States government.

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But for this stuff
they're not supposed to be

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:05.430 align:middle line:84%
doing in their
strange alliances.

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:07.804 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: But the stuff that
they didn't want to inform

00:42:07.804 --> 00:42:10.195 align:middle line:84%
Congress about, there was
this other Anderson trust that

00:42:10.195 --> 00:42:10.995 align:middle line:90%
existed--

00:42:10.995 --> 00:42:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, that's what
I was getting to, right.

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: --off the books, and
that they had access to this.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Because what they did
is they brought in,

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:22.330 align:middle line:84%
as the first civilian director
of the CIA, was Allen Dulles.

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And so he was the
consigliere, actually,

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.492 align:middle line:90%
for this entire group.

00:42:27.492 --> 00:42:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's an
appropriate word because now

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.199 align:middle line:84%
you need to get
into the bedfellows.

00:42:31.199 --> 00:42:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: Because what
happened is that just as during

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:41.870 align:middle line:84%
the course of World War II, when
the Allies decided that they

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:45.820 align:middle line:84%
were going to invade Europe
and send US military forces

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:53.680 align:middle line:84%
into Europe-- they were going to
go in through Salerno and Anzio

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.600 align:middle line:90%
down in Sicily.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And then they were going to
invade in Normandy on June 6.

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:03.220 align:middle line:84%
But they sent in an
initial wave into Sicily,

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:06.250 align:middle line:90%
into Salerno and into Anzio.

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And so what they did is--
remember now, in 19--

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:16.410 align:middle line:90%
by this time now, this is 1944.

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:18.330 align:middle line:90%
So the war is still going on.

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
planning the invasion what

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:25.990 align:middle line:84%
happened is in the election
of 1940-- remember now,

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:34.884 align:middle line:84%
Truman came in
1945 when FDR died.

00:43:34.884 --> 00:43:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And so he served out the
remainder of the term

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:41.070 align:middle line:84%
that-- FDR had been
elected in 1944.

00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:43.130 align:middle line:90%
So that went to 1946.

00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:47.340 align:middle line:84%
So there was this-- or
excuse me, he died in 1945.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:50.920 align:middle line:84%
So he was until 1946 and
filled out the campaign.

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:54.520 align:middle line:84%
The next campaign when Truman
was going to run for election,

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.190 align:middle line:84%
remember, everybody
thought he was going

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:58.620 align:middle line:90%
to lose time to Tom Dewey.

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And so Tom Dewey had-- everybody
assumed he was going to be

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:04.170 align:middle line:84%
the new president, the
Republican president, right?

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:07.330 align:middle line:84%
So Tom Dewey sent one
of his representatives

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:10.530 align:middle line:84%
up to the Great Meadows
prison in northern New York,

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:12.410 align:middle line:84%
up north of Lake
George, in a place

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:14.180 align:middle line:90%
called Comstock in New York.

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was a big
white collar prison

00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:22.270 align:middle line:84%
where the organized crime people
had would get to go to, right?

00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out my father ended
up being a prison guard there.

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:33.800 align:middle line:84%
He was in the invasion,
actually, at Salerno.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And he was wounded there and
so he was sent back early.

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:39.475 align:middle line:84%
But he came in just
after these events

00:44:39.475 --> 00:44:40.600 align:middle line:90%
had happened at the prison.

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.170 align:middle line:90%
And so he found out about them.

00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:47.010 align:middle line:84%
What happened is Tom Dewey
sent a representative of him

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:51.300 align:middle line:84%
to the prison, whose
name is Murray Gurfein.

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:54.020 align:middle line:84%
He was a special assistant
district attorney in New York

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:57.540 align:middle line:84%
because Tom Dewey had been the
district attorney in New York,

00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.370 align:middle line:84%
and then become the
governor of New York.

00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And then he was running
as the Republican nominee.

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:05.020 align:middle line:84%
He sent Murray
Gurfein to the prison

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:07.170 align:middle line:90%
to meet with Lucky Luciano.

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And Lucky Luciano
had been sentence

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:13.980 align:middle line:84%
for white slavery, prostitution,
supervising prostitution.

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And he was in the state
prison up in New York.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So Murray Gurfein went in and
had a negotiation with him.

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And they agreed that they
would let Lucky Luciano out

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:32.480 align:middle line:84%
of prison, would set aside his
conviction, let him get out,

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.080 align:middle line:90%
and he'd go back to Sicily.

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And he would organize
the mafia in Sicily

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:42.300 align:middle line:84%
to be special scouts for the
invading forces at Salerno

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:44.080 align:middle line:90%
and Anzio.

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And they would guide them
up through all of Italy

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:51.850 align:middle line:84%
and send them in and
take back Italy and then

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:52.937 align:middle line:90%
go toward Rome, right?

00:45:52.937 --> 00:45:53.770 align:middle line:90%
It's the Fifth Army.

00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:55.925 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk about
the yellow ribbon and all that,

00:45:55.925 --> 00:45:56.725 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:45:56.725 --> 00:46:01.770 align:middle line:10%
>> SHEEHAN: So what happened
is that that was agreed to.

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:04.040 align:middle line:84%
So Lucky Luciano
went back to Sicily.

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And what they did is the
invading forces, when they came

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:11.010 align:middle line:84%
ashore, they had their tanks
and their armored personnel

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:14.620 align:middle line:84%
carriers, they would
tie a yellow bandana

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:18.540 align:middle line:84%
to the aerial, the antennas,
the communication antennas.

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
sign of the mafia.

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:22.550 align:middle line:90%
And that means--

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Protection.

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: --they were
protected by the mafia

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:26.830 align:middle line:84%
and people were to give
them their support.

00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:29.694 align:middle line:84%
And so people would give them
directions through the valleys

00:46:29.694 --> 00:46:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and through the
back roads and how

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:35.170 align:middle line:90%
they could move through Italy.

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is
when the war was over,

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:41.860 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the war, they
went back to these guys

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:45.310 align:middle line:84%
and what they agreed
to do is they set up

00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:49.860 align:middle line:84%
an opium trafficking operation
out of the Golden Triangle

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:52.130 align:middle line:90%
in Laos and Cambodia.

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And they were shipping opium
from the Golden Triangle

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.620 align:middle line:84%
to the Corsican
mafia in Corsica.

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And then they were
transformed it into heroin.

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And then it was coming
into the island of Cuba

00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:06.670 align:middle line:84%
under the control of
the fascist dictator

00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:09.540 align:middle line:90%
Batista, Fulgencio Batista.

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And the mafia was
based in Havana

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:15.440 align:middle line:84%
under Santos Trafficante,
who was the don there.

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And the CIA, after it
was created in 1947,

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:25.760 align:middle line:84%
had a full time guy assigned
to the embassy down in Havana.

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:29.260 align:middle line:90%
And he was there.

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And he set up a thing called the
SEA Supply Corporation, S-E-A,

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.120 align:middle line:90%
the SEA Supply Corporation--

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what
did they supply?

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:37.994 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: --for
Southeast Asia.

00:47:37.994 --> 00:47:39.404 align:middle line:90%
They supplied heroin.

00:47:39.404 --> 00:47:41.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that was
flooded into the US markets.

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:43.695 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: And Paul
Helliwell was this guy's name,

00:47:43.695 --> 00:47:47.160 align:middle line:84%
a full time Central Intelligence
Agency employee with dental

00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:48.600 align:middle line:90%
benefits, retirement benefits.

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And he
was running heroin.

00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: And he was
running the heroin.

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was coming up
into the United States.

00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And a portion of the
profits were then

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:59.230 align:middle line:84%
given over to a company called
the International Business

00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Corporation, the head of
which was William D. Pawley.

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And they were the
ones purchasing

00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:08.120 align:middle line:84%
weapons and explosives
and ammunition

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and flying it into to support
the Nationalist Chinese,

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:15.220 align:middle line:84%
the Kuomintang of General
Chiang Kai-Shek, who

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:19.030 align:middle line:84%
had been opposing the
Japanese and was now opposing

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Mao Zedong and the
communist forces in China.

00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:24.840 align:middle line:84%
So there was this
entire covert operation

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.600 align:middle line:90%
that was running through Cuba.

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And so it was central to
the power of the Central

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.670 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence Agency.

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:34.120 align:middle line:84%
It was a major covert operation
and a source of covert funding

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:37.580 align:middle line:84%
that supplemented their
access to the Anderson trust.

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And so it was critical
for them to maintain

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.090 align:middle line:90%
control of this place.

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
is, so you've got,

00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:48.460 align:middle line:84%
as of 1952, you've got
Eisenhower and Nixon in office.

00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:52.500 align:middle line:84%
You've got them in control,
Nixon running the 5412

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:53.300 align:middle line:90%
committee.

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:58.170 align:middle line:84%
In 1953, Allen Dulles is
made the head of the Central

00:48:58.170 --> 00:48:59.590 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence Agency.

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:04.465 align:middle line:84%
And so you have the
same cabal, made up

00:49:04.465 --> 00:49:06.340 align:middle line:84%
of the people who were
the private investment

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:10.920 align:middle line:84%
clients of Brown Brothers
Harriman, George Herbert

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Walker, who had now gone on
to head up the Union Bank that

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:15.680 align:middle line:90%
financed the rise of Hitler.

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:19.300 align:middle line:84%
You've got Prescott Bush as the
CEO of Brown Brothers Harriman,

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:21.589 align:middle line:84%
Allen Dulles,
their lawyer, being

00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:23.880 align:middle line:84%
the head of the Central
Intelligence Agency with access

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:25.100 align:middle line:90%
to the Anderson trust.

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:29.000 align:middle line:84%
All of this operation
is going on from 1953

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.930 align:middle line:84%
all the way up until 1959,
with Eisenhower being

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:36.160 align:middle line:90%
reelected in 1956 with Nixon.

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And so in 1959,
January, actually

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:48.380 align:middle line:84%
New Year's Day of January 1959,
Fidel Castro and Raul Castro

00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:49.980 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Che Guevera.

00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:53.880 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: --Che Guevera
and the others overthrow

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:57.280 align:middle line:84%
the fascist military
dictator of Cuba,

00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:02.260 align:middle line:84%
who was a business partner with
Paul Helliwell and with Santos

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:05.065 align:middle line:84%
Trafficante in running
the heroin through there.

00:50:05.065 --> 00:50:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Were
they fully aware?

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Was Castro aware of the business
dealings of the United States

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:13.640 align:middle line:84%
running through there,
of the mafia and the--

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: Oh yes, yes he was.

00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:14.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes he was.

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:16.091 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He knew
what was going on.

00:50:16.091 --> 00:50:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: He was a lawyer, an
intelligent guy, well informed.

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:19.520 align:middle line:90%
And so they--

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So he wanted out.

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: --ousted
all of them.

00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:21.940 align:middle line:90%
He ousted all of those people.

00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:23.880 align:middle line:84%
He shut down all the
gambling casinos,

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.400 align:middle line:84%
shut down the house
of prostitution,

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.110 align:middle line:84%
shut down the
heroin trafficking,

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:28.520 align:middle line:90%
and threw them all out.

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:30.530 align:middle line:90%
And so the mafia people fled.

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And they fled up to Florida,
up to Miami and Tampa.

00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And the Batista
supporters all fled.

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:40.300 align:middle line:90%
And they set up camp there.

00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is Richard
Nixon, as the head of the 5412

00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:48.430 align:middle line:84%
committee, issued an
ultimatum to Fidel Castro,

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:52.550 align:middle line:84%
and said look it, you have to
have no diplomatic relations

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:55.080 align:middle line:90%
with Russia or China.

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:57.680 align:middle line:84%
You're part of the
Monroe Doctrine,

00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:00.110 align:middle line:84%
of all of our control
over Latin America.

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And as a conditional
precedent to our

00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:04.070 align:middle line:84%
giving you any
recognition at all,

00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:06.410 align:middle line:84%
you have to agree to have
no diplomatic relations

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:08.520 align:middle line:84%
with either of these
two communist countries.

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And Fidel Castro
told him to bug off.

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.070 align:middle line:84%
They weren't going
to agree to do that.

00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:13.350 align:middle line:84%
They were going to have
diplomatic relations

00:51:13.350 --> 00:51:14.320 align:middle line:90%
with everyone.

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And so immediately
Richard Nixon,

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:19.880 align:middle line:84%
with the authority
of Eisenhower,

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:23.330 align:middle line:84%
mounted a covert campaign
against the government

00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:26.740 align:middle line:84%
of Fidel Castro and Raul
Castro and Che Guevara.

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And what they'd set up is
a private covert operation

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:31.600 align:middle line:90%
called Operation 40.

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And they began to recruit
anti-Castro Cuban exiles

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:38.140 align:middle line:90%
into this operation.

00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And they began to fund
them out of the Miami

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:41.610 align:middle line:90%
station of the CIA.

00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:44.470 align:middle line:84%
They set up a major
operation out of Miami.

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And they were funding
paramilitary attacks

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.330 align:middle line:90%
against the island.

00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:51.050 align:middle line:84%
They were blowing up bridges,
burning entire sugar fields,

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and poisoning sugar exports
to the Soviet Union.

00:51:55.310 --> 00:51:58.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Without any executive
or judiciary or any one

00:51:58.560 --> 00:51:59.814 align:middle line:90%
of the branches of knowledge?

00:51:59.814 --> 00:52:01.980 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: Well no, no,
no, this was a straight CIA

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:02.990 align:middle line:90%
operation.

00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:05.180 align:middle line:84%
This was a straight
up CIA operation,

00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:07.770 align:middle line:84%
congressional authorization,
presidential sign up,

00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:10.170 align:middle line:90%
oh yeah, the whole operation.

00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:15.446 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what was
going on as of 1959, 1960.

00:52:15.446 --> 00:52:21.130 align:middle line:84%
But then what happens is that
when Richard Nixon is, in 1960,

00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:24.120 align:middle line:84%
pursuing the
Republican nomination,

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:27.480 align:middle line:84%
and so as soon as Nelson
Rockefeller withdrew

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:30.922 align:middle line:84%
from the Michigan
primary in June 1960,

00:52:30.922 --> 00:52:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Richard Nixon
realized he was going

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:34.480 align:middle line:84%
to be the nominee for
the Republican Party.

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And he assumed he was going
to win the nomination.

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And he knew that
this young Kennedy

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:41.927 align:middle line:84%
kid was running for the
Democratic party nomination,

00:52:41.927 --> 00:52:44.260 align:middle line:84%
thought he wasn't going to
have any trouble beating him.

00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And so what he
did, Richard Nixon,

00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:48.920 align:middle line:84%
as the chair of the
5412 committee, still

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:52.660 align:middle line:84%
as vice president,
contacts Howard Hughes,

00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:55.280 align:middle line:84%
using a private phone they
had in the National Security

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Council, contacts
Howard Hughes who

00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:01.260 align:middle line:84%
had become an asset for the
National Security Council.

00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:02.779 align:middle line:90%
He was a covert asset.

00:53:02.779 --> 00:53:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And he had set up a thing
called the Summa Corporation.

00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And they, for example, had
built the Glomar Explorer,

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:10.180 align:middle line:84%
which was able to pick
up Russian submarines

00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:11.346 align:middle line:90%
off the bottom of the ocean.

00:53:11.346 --> 00:53:14.950 align:middle line:84%
He was engaged in a whole series
of technological support made

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:16.360 align:middle line:90%
for covert operations.

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Richard Nixon reached out
to him in a secure phone

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:23.710 align:middle line:84%
and asked Howard
Hughes in June of 1960

00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:26.700 align:middle line:84%
to set up a professional
assassination team,

00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:30.470 align:middle line:84%
to assassinate Fidel Castro
and Raul Castro and Che Guevara

00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:33.480 align:middle line:84%
and the other five comandantes,
the new revolutionary Cuban

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:34.290 align:middle line:90%
government.

00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Howard Hughes didn't agree or
disagree in the phone call.

00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:42.100 align:middle line:84%
But what he did is-- they
have the phone call-- he

00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:45.320 align:middle line:84%
brings in a young lawyer
by the name of Bob Maheu

00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:47.560 align:middle line:84%
and assigns him--
he says, Nixon's

00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:48.840 align:middle line:90%
getting ready to be president.

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.890 align:middle line:84%
He's asked us to set up
the assassination group

00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:52.848 align:middle line:84%
to keep it completely
away from the White House

00:53:52.848 --> 00:53:53.840 align:middle line:90%
so it's unknown.

00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I want you
to get this done.

00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Bob Maheu goes and sits down
with Johnny Roselli, who

00:54:01.810 --> 00:54:05.060 align:middle line:84%
is the bag man for
Sam Giancana, who

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:07.220 align:middle line:84%
was the head of the
mafia in Chicago.

00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:11.160 align:middle line:84%
He goes and meets
with Johnny Roselli,

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:14.230 align:middle line:84%
first in Las Vegas and then a
second meeting out in the Brown

00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:16.860 align:middle line:90%
Derby, out in Los Angeles.

00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And they have this meeting,
these set of meetings.

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And Bob Maheu asks Johnny
Roselli to get the mafia

00:54:24.850 --> 00:54:27.600 align:middle line:84%
to assassinate Fidel Castro
and these other people,

00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:29.950 align:middle line:84%
said you guys got your own
reasons for wanting him out

00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:31.280 align:middle line:90%
of there.

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.960 align:middle line:84%
He closed out your casinos and
the houses of prostitution.

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is
a win-win, right?

00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:37.803 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: If you guys
benefit, then we can reestablish

00:54:37.803 --> 00:54:39.030 align:middle line:90%
the heroin trafficking.

00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:41.230 align:middle line:84%
You guys are running
it for us, right?

00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And so Johnny Roselli
says look, I've

00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:46.492 align:middle line:84%
got to go meet with Sam
Giancana, my principal,

00:54:46.492 --> 00:54:48.700 align:middle line:84%
to know whether we're going
to be allowed to do this.

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So Johnny Roselli and Bob
Maheu went and sat down

00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:53.680 align:middle line:90%
with Sam Giancana up in Chicago.

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Giancana says, well look,
I'm supportive enough

00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:56.830 align:middle line:90%
of doing this.

00:54:56.830 --> 00:54:59.130 align:middle line:84%
But if we're going to
do this done in Cuba,

00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:01.210 align:middle line:84%
that's Santos
Trafficante's territory.

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:03.130 align:middle line:84%
We've got to go down
and meet with Santos.

00:55:03.130 --> 00:55:05.980 align:middle line:84%
So they go down and
meet in the end of June

00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:08.030 align:middle line:84%
or early July, that
first week of July.

00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:10.300 align:middle line:84%
They go down to
Fontainebleau Hotel.

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:12.260 align:middle line:90%
They hold three meetings.

00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Santos Trafficante's
telling me--

00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:16.930 align:middle line:84%
was telling my chief
investigator all this

00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:19.630 align:middle line:84%
because-- it's a long
story, but he was a client

00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:21.530 align:middle line:90%
of F. Lee Bailey's law firm.

00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And I was one of the three trial
attorneys at Lee Bailey's law

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:24.460 align:middle line:90%
firm.

00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:26.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's how I'm getting
all this information, right?

00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:29.020 align:middle line:90%
So Santos tells us all about it.

00:55:29.020 --> 00:55:32.310 align:middle line:84%
So what he does, he says,
"Look, I'm agreeable to do this.

00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:33.930 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm going
to do this thing--"

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:35.895 align:middle line:84%
which they kept referring
to it as this thing--

00:55:35.895 --> 00:55:38.987 align:middle line:84%
"if I'm going to do
this thing, then I

00:55:38.987 --> 00:55:41.070 align:middle line:84%
need to be assured that
this is coming from Nixon,

00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:46.630 align:middle line:84%
the president, and not just from
Howard Hughes or Bob Maheu."

00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, "I want a person
from Nixon to come to a meeting

00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and give me their assurances
this is from Nixon."

00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So they'd have
immunity if anything came down

00:55:55.970 --> 00:55:56.770 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:55:56.770 --> 00:55:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: Well, yeah, because
he just wanted to say that this

00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:00.340 align:middle line:90%
was authorized.

00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:01.839 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to know
it was authorized.

00:56:01.839 --> 00:56:03.340 align:middle line:84%
So a guy comes to
the third meeting

00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:06.590 align:middle line:84%
using the nom de guerre Mr. Ed,
who is Sheffield Edwards, who

00:56:06.590 --> 00:56:09.720 align:middle line:84%
was the chief of security for
the Central Intelligence Agency

00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:12.399 align:middle line:84%
under Allen Dulles and
under Richard Nixon.

00:56:12.399 --> 00:56:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And so he gives them
the green light.

00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:15.130 align:middle line:90%
So they go ahead and do it.

00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:17.210 align:middle line:84%
But Santos Trafficante
says, you know,

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:19.210 align:middle line:84%
I didn't fall off no
melon wagon, he said.

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to make the assassination

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:27.850 align:middle line:84%
team made up of 15 of
my former gunman who

00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:31.320 align:middle line:84%
are anti-Castro Cubans
who are now up in Miami

00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:34.790 align:middle line:84%
who are working for
Operation 40 for the CIA,

00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:36.720 align:middle line:84%
so that if any of
them get caught

00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.880 align:middle line:84%
attempting to
assassinate Castro,

00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:41.560 align:middle line:84%
the agency is going
to get blamed.

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to have to
move in and cover for them

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:46.990 align:middle line:84%
and shut down any kind of
investigation of these kinds.

00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So built
in protection.

00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:48.526 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: So he's the one.

00:56:48.526 --> 00:56:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Trafficante's the one
that set up this cover.

00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:54.570 align:middle line:84%
They're really going to be
functioning as off the shelf

00:56:54.570 --> 00:57:01.450 align:middle line:84%
agents for Richard Nixon,
at the behest of Bob Maheu.

00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
set this whole thing up.

00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:06.630 align:middle line:84%
But if they get
caught, the agency's

00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:11.267 align:middle line:84%
then going to have their
butt in a crack, as they say,

00:57:11.267 --> 00:57:13.100 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
have to jump in and try

00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:14.012 align:middle line:90%
to cover for that.

00:57:14.012 --> 00:57:14.970 align:middle line:90%
So that's what happens.

00:57:14.970 --> 00:57:17.050 align:middle line:84%
So they set up this
15 man group that

00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:18.770 align:middle line:90%
was code named the S-Force.

00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And they were going to
try to assassinate Castro.

00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:24.990 align:middle line:84%
But what happened is,
much to their chagrin,

00:57:24.990 --> 00:57:27.140 align:middle line:84%
they were also planning,
when Richard Nixon

00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:28.770 align:middle line:84%
gets elected
president, they were

00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:31.870 align:middle line:84%
going to send in a group
of anti-Castro Cubans

00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:34.720 align:middle line:84%
to quote, invade Cuba
at the Bay of Pigs,

00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:37.530 align:middle line:84%
and they were going to
go ashore on the beach.

00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And they were going
to immediately ask

00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:40.369 align:middle line:90%
for the military support.

00:57:40.369 --> 00:57:41.910 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
announce that they

00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:43.670 align:middle line:84%
were the free Cuban
new government,

00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:44.870 align:middle line:90%
revolutionary governor.

00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And the United States
under new President Nixon

00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:51.110 align:middle line:84%
would recognize them and send
in the United States Marines

00:57:51.110 --> 00:57:53.320 align:middle line:84%
and overthrow Castro's
government, right,

00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:55.050 align:middle line:84%
much like they'd done
15 times before--

00:57:55.050 --> 00:57:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Sure,
everywhere else.

00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:56.990 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: --in South America.

00:57:56.990 --> 00:58:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And so the problem is
Nixon didn't get elected.

00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:04.800 align:middle line:84%
John Kennedy ends up beating
him and becomes president.

00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And when he comes on board,
he's informed about the plan

00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:11.000 align:middle line:90%
to invade Cuba with this force.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.260 align:middle line:84%
He refuses to provide
US military invasion.

00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:15.900 align:middle line:84%
He said look, if
you're insisting--

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:21.430 align:middle line:84%
if the CIA is insisting that if
these few hundred men go ashore

00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:24.140 align:middle line:84%
in the Bay of Pigs and
announce the new revolutionary

00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:27.342 align:middle line:84%
government, the people of Cuba
will wall rise up against Fidel

00:58:27.342 --> 00:58:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Castro because they don't like
him and they'll all rise up,

00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:31.290 align:middle line:90%
and they'll overthrow Castro.

00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:33.470 align:middle line:90%
And if that's true, that's fine.

00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:35.010 align:middle line:90%
Then you go ahead and do it.

00:58:35.010 --> 00:58:37.930 align:middle line:84%
But he was not going to
supply Marine Corps, Air Force

00:58:37.930 --> 00:58:39.620 align:middle line:90%
cover, or anything.

00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Now so what they figured
out is that-- now he's

00:58:43.410 --> 00:58:45.820 align:middle line:90%
elected in November of 1960.

00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:49.750 align:middle line:84%
He's sworn in on
January 21, 1961.

00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:55.260 align:middle line:84%
He finds out about the plan
for the Cuban invasion,

00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:58.870 align:middle line:84%
and refuses the military
support for the thing.

00:58:58.870 --> 00:59:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And they go ahead in
April, 17th of 1961,

00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:05.990 align:middle line:90%
and they stage the invasion.

00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.860 align:middle line:90%
And they go in.

00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's a long
story, but people

00:59:08.850 --> 00:59:11.900 align:middle line:84%
are saying they screwed
up, because they

00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:14.580 align:middle line:84%
had some private military
planes they were going to use

00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:16.050 align:middle line:90%
for air cover for these guys.

00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:17.690 align:middle line:84%
But they were based
out of Nicaragua,

00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:20.060 align:middle line:84%
and it was a
different time zone.

00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And so they arrived
an hour late.

00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:24.050 align:middle line:84%
So these guys that went
onto the beach and got

00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:25.980 align:middle line:84%
discovered by the
Cuban military,

00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:28.030 align:middle line:84%
and they were pounding
them for an hour.

00:59:28.030 --> 00:59:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And when the planes
came, they were already

00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:31.650 align:middle line:90%
annihilated on the beach.

00:59:31.650 --> 00:59:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And so it wasn't
Kennedy's refusal

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:36.580 align:middle line:84%
to provide air support
that was their problem.

00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:36.910 align:middle line:90%
It was--

00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It was
a time zone issue.

00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:39.075 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: --their
own screw up.

00:59:39.075 --> 00:59:40.500 align:middle line:90%
And that's all true.

00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom line is
they all get captured.

00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:45.230 align:middle line:90%
And Nixon is humiliated.

00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:47.240 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is he
wasn't there anymore,

00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:50.280 align:middle line:84%
so Kennedy ends up getting
humiliated over this.

00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Kennedy apologizes
to Khrushchev,

00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:53.767 align:middle line:84%
takes full
responsibility for it,

00:59:53.767 --> 00:59:55.350 align:middle line:84%
promises Khrushchev
that they're going

00:59:55.350 --> 01:00:00.670 align:middle line:84%
to stop any of the paramilitary
operations, but doesn't do it.

01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Kennedy lies to Khrushchev.

01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And so what they
do is all they do

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:07.330 align:middle line:84%
is change the code
name from Operation 40

01:00:07.330 --> 01:00:09.437 align:middle line:90%
to Operation Mongoose.

01:00:09.437 --> 01:00:10.520 align:middle line:90%
But he's furious because--

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because it's
happening in the Everglades?

01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:16.460 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: Because he knew
what they were really doing.

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:19.810 align:middle line:84%
The CIA never thought that that
military group could take back

01:00:19.810 --> 01:00:20.610 align:middle line:90%
Cuba.

01:00:20.610 --> 01:00:22.620 align:middle line:84%
They didn't believe that
people were going to rise up.

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:24.370 align:middle line:84%
They thought that what
was going to happen

01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:26.840 align:middle line:84%
is that when they got
trapped on the beach

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:29.030 align:middle line:84%
that they were going
to come to Kennedy

01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:31.740 align:middle line:84%
and insist that he has to send
in the United States Marine

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Corps to protect
these people now.

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they tried to do.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.150 align:middle line:90%
They tried to box him in.

01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:40.040 align:middle line:84%
They actually went to
a major social event

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.580 align:middle line:84%
that Kennedy was attending
that night of April 17th when

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:46.110 align:middle line:84%
the invasion was taking
place and told him

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:49.645 align:middle line:84%
that they were getting
trapped on the beach.

01:00:49.645 --> 01:00:51.620 align:middle line:90%
He had to send in the military.

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:55.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, unbeknownst
to Kennedy, the Navy

01:00:55.770 --> 01:00:59.020 align:middle line:84%
had actually mobilized the
Marine Corps and the Navy,

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:02.950 align:middle line:84%
and it stationed ships
fully loaded with US Marines

01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:06.360 align:middle line:84%
off the coast of Cuba,
without any authority

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.784 align:middle line:84%
of the president at all, in
complete defiance of his order

01:01:09.784 --> 01:01:12.450 align:middle line:84%
that there was to be no military
support for these people at all

01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:13.830 align:middle line:90%
from the US military.

01:01:13.830 --> 01:01:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And they staged it getting
it perfectly ready.

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And so when Kennedy said
no, they were furious at him

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:25.920 align:middle line:84%
for not allowing them to
trap him right into doing it.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And Kennedy outfoxed
them and refused

01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:30.820 align:middle line:84%
to provide the military support,
so they were all captured.

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:33.531 align:middle line:84%
So as I say, but he went
ahead and apologized for it

01:01:33.531 --> 01:01:35.780 align:middle line:84%
to Khrushchev, promised he
was going to stop doing it,

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:40.140 align:middle line:84%
changed the name from Operation
40 to Operation Mongoose,

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:42.546 align:middle line:84%
and continued the
paramilitary operations.

01:01:42.546 --> 01:01:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Well it didn't take
long for Khrushchev

01:01:44.170 --> 01:01:45.760 align:middle line:84%
to realize that
he'd been lied to,

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.840 align:middle line:84%
so he starts
putting missiles in.

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:50.330 align:middle line:84%
He starts putting
missiles into Cuba.

01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:55.020 align:middle line:84%
That all goes down from between
April of 1961 all the way

01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:58.220 align:middle line:84%
for the whole year, they're
putting in missiles.

01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:01.177 align:middle line:84%
And they're discovered
in October of 1962.

01:02:01.177 --> 01:02:03.135 align:middle line:84%
Then you have the famous
Cuban Missile Crisis--

01:02:03.135 --> 01:02:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Missile Crisis, yeah.

01:02:03.610 --> 01:02:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: --in
October of 1962.

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
that Kennedy is being

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:15.197 align:middle line:84%
told by the joint chiefs
of staff under-- it

01:02:15.197 --> 01:02:17.030 align:middle line:84%
was under Lemnitzer,
who was the head of it,

01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:19.160 align:middle line:84%
the United States
Army chief of staff.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:22.000 align:middle line:84%
But Curtis LeMay, who was
the head of the Air Force--

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.710 align:middle line:84%
he was the Air Force
chief of staff--

01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:26.069 align:middle line:90%
he kept wanting to invade Cuba.

01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And he kept saying,
look, we're going

01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:29.680 align:middle line:84%
to invade Cuba and
knock out the missiles.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.490 align:middle line:84%
But Kennedy kept saying,
oh wait a second,

01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:34.600 align:middle line:84%
if we try to do that, they've
already got missiles in there.

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:37.110 align:middle line:84%
They may fire the missiles
at the United States.

01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:38.786 align:middle line:90%
Well Curtis LeMay didn't care.

01:02:38.786 --> 01:02:40.910 align:middle line:84%
He said if they fire missiles
at the United States,

01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:43.260 align:middle line:84%
then we'll totally
destroy the Soviet Union.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.880 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to have
a thermonuclear

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.930 align:middle line:90%
war against Russia.

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened is on the
night of October 18th of 1962,

01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Kennedy had issued an
ultimatum to Khrushchev,

01:02:56.070 --> 01:02:59.510 align:middle line:84%
saying that if you allow
any ships, Russian ships,

01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:01.410 align:middle line:84%
bearing additional
missiles to cross

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:04.630 align:middle line:84%
this particular
line of longitude,

01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:06.030 align:middle line:84%
the United States
and Russia will

01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:08.580 align:middle line:90%
be in a technical state of war.

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And what happens on the
night of October 18,

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:15.510 align:middle line:84%
a ship bearing additional
missiles crossed the line.

01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And so Curtis LeMay
immediately ordered,

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:21.700 align:middle line:84%
without presidential
authority, ordered

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:23.460 align:middle line:84%
all of the United
States military forces

01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:27.680 align:middle line:84%
to go to DEFCON 2, which is
just below a shooting war.

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And he ordered all the
Strategic Air Command

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.870 align:middle line:84%
to go to their fail safe
points around the borders

01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:37.050 align:middle line:84%
of the Soviet Union and ordered
a U2 overflights of the Soviet

01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:40.230 align:middle line:84%
Union, within radar range
so the Soviets would

01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:41.640 align:middle line:90%
know that this was happening.

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:44.720 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to instigate
the Soviets into trying

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:47.290 align:middle line:84%
to take steps to get
ready for a nuclear war

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:50.800 align:middle line:84%
so they could, again, trap
Kennedy and say you can't just

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:53.650 align:middle line:84%
stand by, they're mobilizing
in the Soviet Union.

01:03:53.650 --> 01:03:56.050 align:middle line:84%
We've got to have a nuclear
first strike against them

01:03:56.050 --> 01:03:58.913 align:middle line:84%
and get their missiles while
they're still in the silos.

01:03:58.913 --> 01:04:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
they tried to do.

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And so Kenny O'Donnell
came to Kennedy

01:04:06.350 --> 01:04:09.100 align:middle line:84%
and told him that the
joint chiefs had all voted

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:11.290 align:middle line:90%
to attack the island of Cuba.

01:04:11.290 --> 01:04:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And Kennedy ordered
them to stand down

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.790 align:middle line:84%
and said, "I will not be
the man that does this,"

01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:18.290 align:middle line:84%
because he knows
that that was going

01:04:18.290 --> 01:04:20.750 align:middle line:84%
to trigger a thermonuclear
exchange with Russia.

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:26.160 align:middle line:84%
So on that night of
October 18th of 1962--

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Kenny O'Donnell told us this--
said that he came and told

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:31.045 align:middle line:90%
Kennedy, and Kennedy sat there.

01:04:31.045 --> 01:04:32.580 align:middle line:90%
He was in his rocking chair.

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:34.730 align:middle line:90%
And tears came to his eyes.

01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:37.720 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I will not be
the man that does this."

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And he ordered them all to
stand down from DEFCON 2.

01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:41.520 align:middle line:90%
He ordered them to stop.

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:45.770 align:middle line:84%
He contacted Khrushchev, agreed
that he would take the US

01:04:45.770 --> 01:04:47.250 align:middle line:84%
missiles out of
Turkey in exchange

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:49.010 align:middle line:84%
for them taking the
missiles out of Cuba.

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And what he did is he started
an exchange, a completely secret

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:56.170 align:middle line:84%
exchange of letters
with Khrushchev

01:04:56.170 --> 01:04:59.460 align:middle line:84%
in which Kennedy and Khrushchev
agreed that they were going

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:02.640 align:middle line:84%
to start to disassemble
the nuclear warheads

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:03.900 align:middle line:90%
of all of their missiles.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:07.610 align:middle line:84%
They had come right to within
seconds of a thermonuclear

01:05:07.610 --> 01:05:08.410 align:middle line:90%
exchange.

01:05:08.410 --> 01:05:11.120 align:middle line:84%
It would have destroyed the
entire human civilization,

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:14.160 align:middle line:84%
and potentially killed virtually
all life on the planet--

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.180 align:middle line:90%
how completely absurd this was.

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And Kennedy said that we
had come to this moment

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and he was not going to allow
this to ever happen again,

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:23.980 align:middle line:84%
so he was going to secretly
negotiate this agreement

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:26.520 align:middle line:84%
to disassemble all of the
nuclear warheads, the United

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:28.270 align:middle line:90%
States and the Soviet Union.

01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And he reached out
to Pope John the 23rd

01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:36.100 align:middle line:84%
and asked Pope John the 23rd
to be the broker of this,

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:39.760 align:middle line:84%
so that they could assure
them that both sides were

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.370 align:middle line:90%
disassembling their missiles.

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And he reached out to Castro,
tried to normalize relations

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:47.400 align:middle line:90%
with Castro.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And so the decision
was made to kill him.

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is that
right after the Cuban Missile

01:05:57.150 --> 01:06:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Crisis stood down,
he in fact, Kennedy,

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:03.790 align:middle line:84%
ordered the shutdown of
the five paramilitary bases

01:06:03.790 --> 01:06:06.450 align:middle line:84%
that had been set up under
Operation 40 by Nixon.

01:06:06.450 --> 01:06:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And it continued under
Mongoose, that they

01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:12.030 align:middle line:90%
had won at No Name Key.

01:06:12.030 --> 01:06:15.520 align:middle line:90%
They had one in the Everglades.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:18.590 align:middle line:90%
They had one on Swan Island.

01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:23.580 align:middle line:84%
They had two of them at Lake
Pontchartrain in New Orleans.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:26.930 align:middle line:84%
They had all these bases where
these paramilitary anti-Castro

01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Cubans were all
mobilized and were

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:32.810 align:middle line:84%
being trained and supervised
by CIA liaison guys.

01:06:32.810 --> 01:06:34.960 align:middle line:84%
So he ordered them
all to be shut down

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.750 align:middle line:84%
and to stand down from any
further military operations

01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:38.730 align:middle line:90%
against Cuba.

01:06:38.730 --> 01:06:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And he was carrying on
this secret negotiation

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:46.070 align:middle line:84%
with Khrushchev when one of
the groups on Swan Island--

01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:49.020 align:middle line:84%
actually No Name Key actually
under Frank Sturgis--

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:54.970 align:middle line:84%
attacked a Soviet ship
in the harbor of Havana

01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:58.510 align:middle line:84%
and sank it on
December 3rd of 1962.

01:06:58.510 --> 01:07:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And Kennedy was
cataleptic about this.

01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And he ordered in
the US Marshals

01:07:02.830 --> 01:07:07.000 align:middle line:84%
on these five helicopter
gunships into No Name Key

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.660 align:middle line:84%
and burnt out the base and
arrested all those guys,

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and charged them with a
violation of the Neutrality

01:07:13.090 --> 01:07:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Act, of attacking a country with
whom the United States is not

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:19.080 align:middle line:84%
at war, and arrested
them, and figured

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:21.420 align:middle line:84%
that that was a shot across
the bow of all these guys,

01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:23.310 align:middle line:84%
telling them to
stand down from this.

01:07:23.310 --> 01:07:25.170 align:middle line:90%
And then he released them.

01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:27.290 align:middle line:84%
But the problem was that
a second group of them,

01:07:27.290 --> 01:07:30.230 align:middle line:84%
the ones in the Everglades
under E. Howard Hunt,

01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:32.460 align:middle line:84%
the CIA supervisor,
started to plan

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:34.020 align:middle line:90%
another attack against Cuba.

01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:36.770 align:middle line:84%
So Bobby and John send in
the helicopter gunships

01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:38.435 align:middle line:84%
and burnt them
out, arrested them

01:07:38.435 --> 01:07:40.560 align:middle line:84%
and charged them with a
violation of the Neutrality

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:41.360 align:middle line:90%
Act.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.925 align:middle line:84%
And the S-Force guys
all wanted to kill him,

01:07:44.925 --> 01:07:46.300 align:middle line:84%
because they
considered him to be

01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:48.410 align:middle line:84%
a traitor, because
he had authorized

01:07:48.410 --> 01:07:49.730 align:middle line:90%
them to do all these attacks.

01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And so he was now
punishing them for trying

01:07:52.210 --> 01:07:53.580 align:middle line:90%
to continue doing them.

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:55.200 align:middle line:90%
And so they wanted to kill him.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:59.180 align:middle line:84%
But the S-Force itself--
Santos Trafficante

01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:04.170 align:middle line:84%
told us, in Lee Bailey's
firm, that the S-Force

01:08:04.170 --> 01:08:06.386 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that made the
decision to kill Kennedy.

01:08:06.386 --> 01:08:08.010 align:middle line:84%
I knew perfectly well
that wasn't true.

01:08:08.010 --> 01:08:09.260 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
the wherewithal--

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:10.720 align:middle line:84%
they had the
wherewithal to do it,

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:11.700 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't
have the wherewithal

01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:13.000 align:middle line:90%
to get away with it.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is that when
they wanted to kill him, then

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:18.250 align:middle line:84%
it started coming up
the line, who all was

01:08:18.250 --> 01:08:20.620 align:middle line:90%
going to allow them to do this.

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:22.720 align:middle line:84%
So it started moving
up the line and got

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:30.960 align:middle line:84%
to be to Bill Harvey, got to
be to Theodore Shackley, who

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:35.020 align:middle line:84%
was now the Miami station
chief down there, that all

01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:38.130 align:middle line:84%
these people started deciding
whether to let this happen.

01:08:38.130 --> 01:08:42.890 align:middle line:84%
But what happened is Allen
Dulles, who had been relieved

01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:45.830 align:middle line:84%
of command after the
Bay of Pigs invasion,

01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and then trying to trap
Kennedy into doing this,

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:49.750 align:middle line:84%
had been relieved
of his position

01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:50.890 align:middle line:90%
as the head of the CIA.

01:08:50.890 --> 01:08:53.880 align:middle line:84%
He was still the consigliere
for all of these people.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And they then consulted
with the people

01:08:56.370 --> 01:08:59.960 align:middle line:84%
who were a certain core
group of these guys that

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:02.729 align:middle line:84%
were the financiers of
Brown Brothers Harriman.

01:09:02.729 --> 01:09:05.340 align:middle line:84%
They were the financial
clients of these people.

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:08.510 align:middle line:84%
They ended up greenlighting
this assassination.

01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And so Allen Dulles was the
field commander that actually

01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:13.600 align:middle line:90%
commanded those people.

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And they moved in, and the
S-Force moved into place

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:18.229 align:middle line:90%
to try to kill Kennedy.

01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:20.510 align:middle line:84%
They were going to kill him
in Miami, if they could,

01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:23.140 align:middle line:84%
so the symbol would be perfectly
obvious of what had happened.

01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:25.550 align:middle line:84%
But Kennedy got a
warning and didn't go.

01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Then they were going to
assassinate him in Chicago.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And he got a warning
and they didn't go.

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And then he insisted he
had to go down to Dallas.

01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:35.410 align:middle line:90%
And they set up down in Dallas.

01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:37.939 align:middle line:84%
And the guy who ran
the field operation

01:09:37.939 --> 01:09:41.399 align:middle line:84%
was a guy by the name of
William Rip Robertson.

01:09:41.399 --> 01:09:44.818 align:middle line:84%
They had the shooters,
David Morales,

01:09:44.818 --> 01:09:46.609 align:middle line:84%
they called the Indian
was one of the guys.

01:09:46.609 --> 01:09:48.318 align:middle line:84%
Felix Rodriguez, Rafeal
Chi Chi Quintero.

01:09:48.318 --> 01:09:49.775 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: These
were the S-Forces.

01:09:49.775 --> 01:09:52.859 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: --Ricardo Chavez,
these were the S-Force guys.

01:09:52.859 --> 01:09:54.290 align:middle line:90%
And they were all deployed.

01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And interesting
enough Edward Lansdale

01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:00.160 align:middle line:84%
was there, the
guy who had become

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:03.190 align:middle line:84%
one of the supervisors
of the secret trust,

01:10:03.190 --> 01:10:04.740 align:middle line:90%
the Anderson trust was there.

01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:07.940 align:middle line:84%
There are photographs of
him in the Daley Plaza.

01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:09.890 align:middle line:84%
They've got photographs
of Rip Robertson.

01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:13.790 align:middle line:84%
We know Rip Robertson was
the field commander of them

01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:16.940 align:middle line:84%
because we have witnesses who
attended other assassination

01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:18.360 align:middle line:90%
attempts on his part.

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:21.080 align:middle line:90%
So they shot him and killed him.

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:22.414 align:middle line:90%
And then they covered it all up.

01:10:22.414 --> 01:10:25.038 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And Johnson was fully
aware that he was [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:25.038 --> 01:10:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: No, no, that's--

01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The night before?

01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: That's
not entirely clear,

01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:29.600 align:middle line:90%
because what we do is we have--

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.641 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm going off
hearsay of the mistress.

01:10:31.641 --> 01:10:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: There's
two witnesses.

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:38.390 align:middle line:84%
There's two witnesses who say
that on the night of November

01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:44.590 align:middle line:84%
21st of 1963, the night before
the assassination, that there

01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:49.320 align:middle line:84%
was a meeting that was
held at the home of Clint

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Murchison, Jr., at his
ranch outside of Dallas.

01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And these two
witnesses, one of whom

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.900 align:middle line:84%
is the mistress
of Lyndon Johnson,

01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:03.070 align:middle line:84%
and the other who is a black
chauffeur for Clint Murchison,

01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:06.930 align:middle line:84%
Jr., who drove some of the
people to the meeting he said.

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:08.960 align:middle line:84%
He said that Lyndon
Johnson was there

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:17.070 align:middle line:84%
and Richard Nixon was there, and
three other people were there.

01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Dulles had flown in
earlier that evening

01:11:19.670 --> 01:11:21.580 align:middle line:84%
and was witnessed
coming into the airport.

01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:24.590 align:middle line:84%
But no one places him
directly in that meeting.

01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:28.670 align:middle line:84%
But what Lyndon Johnson's
mistress asserts

01:11:28.670 --> 01:11:31.874 align:middle line:84%
is that they were all at this
gathering, a social gathering

01:11:31.874 --> 01:11:34.290 align:middle line:84%
actually, because they all had
different reasons for being

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:39.130 align:middle line:84%
down there, including
George Herbert Walker

01:11:39.130 --> 01:11:42.960 align:middle line:90%
Bush was there, in town.

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:45.270 align:middle line:84%
But no one place him in
that meeting, directly.

01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:48.060 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is that
there was a social gathering

01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:50.880 align:middle line:84%
at the home of Clint Murchison
Jr. Well the important thing is

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:54.630 align:middle line:84%
that Clint Murchison Jr. is
the guy that owned the Oaxaca

01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:59.310 align:middle line:84%
ranch down in Mexico where they
trained the assassination team.

01:11:59.310 --> 01:12:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And so they went into
a closed door meeting

01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:03.984 align:middle line:90%
during this social gathering.

01:12:03.984 --> 01:12:05.650 align:middle line:84%
They went into this
closed door meeting.

01:12:05.650 --> 01:12:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And the mistress
of Lyndon Johnson

01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:11.710 align:middle line:84%
said that when he came out of
the meeting he turned to her

01:12:11.710 --> 01:12:14.570 align:middle line:84%
and said, "We aren't going to
have to worry about the Kennedy

01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:16.490 align:middle line:90%
brothers after tomorrow."

01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:18.440 align:middle line:90%
That's what she says.

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:19.280 align:middle line:90%
And the chauffer--

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
the one I had heard.

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.655 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: And the chauffeur
says that these people were

01:12:22.655 --> 01:12:23.900 align:middle line:90%
there.

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:26.070 align:middle line:84%
But none of them have
ever acknowledged it.

01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:28.200 align:middle line:84%
None of the participants
have ever acknowledged it.

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.533 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So the day goes down.

01:12:29.533 --> 01:12:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And now we've got a terrible
situation on time here.

01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:35.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm debating what to do.

01:12:35.610 --> 01:12:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible we can do
literally a bullet point

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.310 align:middle line:84%
journey through
the next 30 years

01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:46.050 align:middle line:84%
from there in 10 minutes so
we can get to the New Paradigm

01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Institute and what
this all means?

01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: Sure.

01:12:48.370 --> 01:12:49.495 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, let's do it.

01:12:49.495 --> 01:12:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: All right, so what
happens is Kennedy's killed.

01:12:52.770 --> 01:12:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Lyndon Johnson, who's his vice
president, comes into power.

01:12:55.450 --> 01:12:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Lyndon Johnson immediately
reverses the positions.

01:12:59.430 --> 01:13:02.920 align:middle line:84%
He refuses to participate in
any kind of a further plan

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:06.250 align:middle line:84%
to disassemble the missiles,
the missile warheads.

01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:09.977 align:middle line:84%
He also reverses an order
that had been signed,

01:13:09.977 --> 01:13:11.560 align:middle line:84%
a national security
decision directive

01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:14.050 align:middle line:84%
that had been signed by
Kennedy to withdraw US

01:13:14.050 --> 01:13:16.290 align:middle line:90%
military forces out of Vietnam.

01:13:16.290 --> 01:13:22.990 align:middle line:84%
He also reverses a
national directive

01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:26.320 align:middle line:84%
that had authorized the printing
up of silver certificates

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.140 align:middle line:90%
that Kennedy had ordered.

01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:29.140 align:middle line:90%
A whole series of things

01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Reverses--

01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: --were reversed.

01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --of all that stuff.

01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:30.810 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: Reverses all of it.

01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Back to
business as usual.

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:33.323 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: Back to
business as usual,

01:13:33.323 --> 01:13:37.890 align:middle line:84%
and mounts up additional
forces into Vietnam,

01:13:37.890 --> 01:13:40.530 align:middle line:84%
goes through that entire
tragedy of Vietnam.

01:13:40.530 --> 01:13:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And then Bobby Kennedy
is laying in wait,

01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:45.220 align:middle line:84%
waiting to run
for the presidency

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:47.520 align:middle line:84%
after Lyndon Johnson
gets done, and wants

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:50.580 align:middle line:84%
to reinitiate an investigation
of the assassination,

01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:52.870 align:middle line:84%
because Bobby
Kennedy is convinced

01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:56.479 align:middle line:84%
that there is this cabal
that killed the president,

01:13:56.479 --> 01:13:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and that he's going
to investigate it

01:13:58.020 --> 01:13:59.370 align:middle line:90%
when he becomes president.

01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:02.470 align:middle line:84%
So Lyndon Johnson
becomes president.

01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:08.720 align:middle line:84%
He serves out the remaining
year of Kennedy's term.

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And then Lyndon Johnson
wins the election in 1964,

01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:18.350 align:middle line:84%
against Goldwater, by 60%, and
is in power for the next four

01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:20.010 align:middle line:90%
years, from '64 to '68.

01:14:20.010 --> 01:14:23.030 align:middle line:84%
But in 1968 when a
number of us were

01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:26.030 align:middle line:84%
trying to talk Bobby
Kennedy into running,

01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:28.460 align:middle line:84%
the bottom line is he wouldn't
run against the sitting

01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:29.260 align:middle line:90%
president.

01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:31.800 align:middle line:84%
But when Lyndon
Johnson almost got

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:35.120 align:middle line:84%
beaten by Eugene McCarthy,
the Democratic senator

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:39.220 align:middle line:84%
from Minnesota, in the
New Hampshire primary

01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:43.140 align:middle line:84%
in January of 1968,
Lyndon Johnson steps down

01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:46.040 align:middle line:84%
in that famous speech,
"I will not seek

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:47.920 align:middle line:84%
and I will not
accept the nomination

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.490 align:middle line:90%
of my party for one more term."

01:14:49.490 --> 01:14:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And he withdraws from the
presidential election.

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:53.155 align:middle line:90%
Bobby Kennedy comes in.

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:55.247 align:middle line:84%
Bobby Kennedy is
getting ready to win.

01:14:55.247 --> 01:14:56.830 align:middle line:84%
He wins all the way
through now and he

01:14:56.830 --> 01:14:57.475 align:middle line:90%
wins the California primary.

01:14:57.475 --> 01:14:58.891 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now
he's in California.

01:14:58.891 --> 01:15:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: He's gunned
down on June 6th of 1968.

01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And then so there's
this horrible series

01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:08.675 align:middle line:84%
of events that follow,
when Bobby is killed.

01:15:08.675 --> 01:15:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And so he doesn't get
elected president.

01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:14.147 align:middle line:84%
Richard Nixon finally gets to be
president after all that time.

01:15:14.147 --> 01:15:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: He was a patient man.

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: That's right.

01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: He paid his service.

01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:18.114 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: He stays
in the background.

01:15:18.114 --> 01:15:21.140 align:middle line:84%
He wins the presidency,
by a small margin,

01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:24.160 align:middle line:90%
over Hubert Humphrey in 1968.

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And there was that dreadful
convention of the Democrats

01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:28.060 align:middle line:90%
in Chicago in 1968.

01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:31.230 align:middle line:90%
The party splinters.

01:15:31.230 --> 01:15:32.210 align:middle line:90%
Nixon wins.

01:15:32.210 --> 01:15:33.420 align:middle line:90%
And Nixon comes into power.

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And he's in power
from '68 to '72.

01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:39.120 align:middle line:84%
He's upping the ante in
Vietnam, huge demonstrations

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.080 align:middle line:90%
in the streets.

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:43.056 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's this whole
fracturing of the American body

01:15:43.056 --> 01:15:43.856 align:middle line:90%
politic.

01:15:43.856 --> 01:15:45.689 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Lot of drugs
coming out of there.

01:15:45.689 --> 01:15:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: All kinds of
things happening then.

01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:50.880 align:middle line:84%
We get to 1972,
and Nixon's getting

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:54.280 align:middle line:84%
to run for his reelection,
and a peculiar thing happens.

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:56.090 align:middle line:84%
The Democratic
National Committee

01:15:56.090 --> 01:15:58.930 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden changes who the
head of the Democratic National

01:15:58.930 --> 01:15:59.920 align:middle line:90%
Committee is.

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And they select a guy by
the name of Larry O'Brien.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that Larry O'Brien,

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:07.160 align:middle line:84%
for 25 years prior
to his being made

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:11.240 align:middle line:84%
the head of the Democratic
National Committee in 1972,

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:15.880 align:middle line:84%
had been the chief Washington
lobbyist for Howard Hughes.

01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And Nixon is immediately
terrified that somehow

01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:20.850 align:middle line:90%
that Larry O'Brien--

01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Information, yeah.

01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: --may have found out
from Howard Hughes that it was

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Richard Nixon that actually had
put together the assassination

01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:30.010 align:middle line:84%
team, originally
tasked to kill Castro,

01:16:30.010 --> 01:16:32.580 align:middle line:84%
who had in fact
killed the president.

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And Nixon is
convinced that that's

01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:42.080 align:middle line:84%
the only thing that can enable
him to lose in 1972 to George

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.390 align:middle line:90%
McGovern, right, in 1972?

01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And so he sends
in-- he's deciding

01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:50.210 align:middle line:84%
he's going to burglarize
the Democratic National

01:16:50.210 --> 01:16:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Headquarters, wiretap the
telephones of Larry O'Brien,

01:16:53.530 --> 01:16:57.210 align:middle line:84%
and bug the office to find out
whether Larry O'Brien, A, knows

01:16:57.210 --> 01:17:00.960 align:middle line:84%
about the fact that Nixon
is the one that put together

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:03.780 align:middle line:84%
the assassination team that
ended up killing Kennedy,

01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:06.700 align:middle line:84%
or secondly, whether he was
going to use that against him.

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:08.060 align:middle line:90%
So he sends the people in.

01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:09.260 align:middle line:90%
They put the wiretaps in.

01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:10.300 align:middle line:90%
One of them fails.

01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:14.440 align:middle line:84%
They go back in to try to
fix the bug in the phone,

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:16.020 align:middle line:90%
and they get caught.

01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And then the whole thing
starts coming unraveled.

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And its long and involved, but
it leads to the secret smoking

01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:28.250 align:middle line:84%
gun conversation on
June 21st of 1972

01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:31.179 align:middle line:84%
in which Bob Haldeman
comes into Nixon's office.

01:17:31.179 --> 01:17:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing
is tape recorded.

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, because he had
a penchant for tape recording

01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.830 align:middle line:90%
everything.

01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: And so he says to
Nixon, he says Mr. President,

01:17:38.410 --> 01:17:40.010 align:middle line:84%
I think we've got
a problem here.

01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:43.410 align:middle line:84%
John Dean, the White House
counsel to the president,

01:17:43.410 --> 01:17:46.950 align:middle line:84%
just received a call from Pat
Gray, the new head of the FBI,

01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:48.540 align:middle line:84%
and said that he's
getting pressure

01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:52.360 align:middle line:84%
to investigate the
origins of this check that

01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:55.700 align:middle line:84%
was found in the inside jacket
pocket of Bernard Barker, one

01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:58.820 align:middle line:84%
of the anti-Castro
Cubans who was arrested.

01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Because it turns out that the
burglary team that went in

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:05.520 align:middle line:84%
to do the burglary is headed up
by Frank Sturgis and E. Howard

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Hunt, the very two guys that
had been the heads of those two

01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:12.770 align:middle line:84%
anti-Castro Cuban
paramilitary bases

01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:16.178 align:middle line:84%
that tried to defy the
president back in 1962.

01:18:16.178 --> 01:18:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So the
evidence is there.

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:18.560 align:middle line:90%
The smoking gun--

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: The
smoking gun is there.

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So he's gone now.

01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:23.110 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: So he's out.

01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:24.200 align:middle line:90%
And so the [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, five minutes
to get all the way to now.

01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: But the bottom line
is that Nixon is out and Gerald

01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Ford is brought in, who
is a member of the Warren

01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Commission, who had
whitewashed the entire Kennedy

01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:39.070 align:middle line:90%
assassination.

01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:43.210 align:middle line:84%
So he's brought in and he
pardons Nixon immediately.

01:18:43.210 --> 01:18:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And so people are
very unhappy about all

01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:49.300 align:middle line:84%
that because they
believe that Nixon

01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:52.030 align:middle line:84%
should have been prosecuted
for what he had done.

01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:54.026 align:middle line:90%
And so he ends up losing.

01:18:54.026 --> 01:18:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And Bob Strauss, the head of the
Democratic National Committee,

01:18:56.650 --> 01:18:59.540 align:middle line:84%
the new guy that's
in, picks Jimmy Carter

01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:01.882 align:middle line:90%
to be the new president.

01:19:01.882 --> 01:19:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And nobody even knows who
Jimmy Carter is in the country.

01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:07.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Jimmy Carter, this
was one more demonstration

01:19:07.710 --> 01:19:10.259 align:middle line:84%
of this elite group picking
what's going to happen.

01:19:10.259 --> 01:19:11.300 align:middle line:90%
They picked Jimmy Carter.

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:13.570 align:middle line:90%
He ends up becoming president.

01:19:13.570 --> 01:19:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And he comes into
office and gets elected.

01:19:17.370 --> 01:19:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things he
does is he establishes

01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:23.310 align:middle line:84%
a new presidential
executive order, cutting off

01:19:23.310 --> 01:19:26.180 align:middle line:84%
military funding to any
foreign dictator who

01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:28.790 align:middle line:84%
in fact systematically
violates the rights of the--

01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: He was a good man.

01:19:30.090 --> 01:19:31.339 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: He was a good man.

01:19:31.339 --> 01:19:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And we had negotiated
that with Carter.

01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:35.800 align:middle line:84%
I was chief counsel by this
time of the United States Jesuit

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:36.710 align:middle line:90%
headquarters.

01:19:36.710 --> 01:19:39.120 align:middle line:84%
We bring in all 54 major
religious denominations

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:41.100 align:middle line:84%
in the United States
and meet with Carter,

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:47.110 align:middle line:84%
who is the delegate-- who is
the candidate for the nomination

01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:48.110 align:middle line:90%
for the Democrats.

01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:50.890 align:middle line:84%
We get him to agree that
if he's elected president,

01:19:50.890 --> 01:19:53.940 align:middle line:84%
he'll issue this executive order
cutting off the military aid.

01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:54.980 align:middle line:90%
And he does.

01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And he cuts off the
military aid to Nicaragua,

01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:59.080 align:middle line:90%
to Anastasio Samoza.

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And he cuts off the military
aid from the United States

01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:03.220 align:middle line:90%
to the Shah of Iran.

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And both of those governments
fall, within six months.

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.549 align:middle line:84%
And so that is the origins
of the Iran-Contra crisis.

01:20:10.549 --> 01:20:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right, and we're
going to skim on past that.

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:14.010 align:middle line:90%
We need to get to Perestroika.

01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:15.093 align:middle line:90%
You were involved in that.

01:20:15.093 --> 01:20:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And now let's start bringing
your involvement in,

01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:20.190 align:middle line:84%
because we're not going
to get all the way

01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:24.480 align:middle line:84%
through the deeds that occurred
regarding the Bushes and Saddam

01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Hussein and the House of
Saud and Osama bin Laden,

01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:32.400 align:middle line:84%
but we know they're
all bedfellows.

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.499 align:middle line:84%
Everyone watching knows
they were bedfellows,

01:20:34.499 --> 01:20:36.290 align:middle line:84%
and this has all been
created for a purpose

01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:39.577 align:middle line:84%
because the whole
Soviet threat went away.

01:20:39.577 --> 01:20:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
your part in that

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:42.490 align:middle line:90%
and go into the paradigms.

01:20:42.490 --> 01:20:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: Well the bottom
line is that in 1979,

01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:50.194 align:middle line:84%
right after we won the Karen
Silkwood case and stopped

01:20:50.194 --> 01:20:52.360 align:middle line:84%
the construction of all
private nuclear power plants

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:54.484 align:middle line:84%
in the United States, and
did the Three Mile Island

01:20:54.484 --> 01:20:58.700 align:middle line:84%
litigation, my staff person
at the Jesuit national

01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:01.624 align:middle line:84%
headquarters, Jimmy
Garrison-- not Jim Garrison--

01:21:01.624 --> 01:21:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Not Jim Garrison.

01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: --from New Orleans,
but Dr. James Garrison,

01:21:05.370 --> 01:21:11.530 align:middle line:84%
eventually-- he, in fact, we
tasked him to go to the Soviet

01:21:11.530 --> 01:21:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Union, because we were going
to try to organize all 54

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:17.900 align:middle line:84%
of the major religious
denominations to undertake

01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:22.770 align:middle line:84%
a 10% cutback in the number of
nuclear missile warheads that

01:21:22.770 --> 01:21:23.570 align:middle line:90%
we had.

01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And we needed the Soviet
Union to respond in kind.

01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:30.030 align:middle line:84%
So Jim Garrison, Jimmy Garrison
went over to the Soviet Union

01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:33.030 align:middle line:84%
and ended up meeting,
eventually, with Gorbachev,

01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:36.350 align:middle line:84%
when he was still the secretary
of agriculture under Andropov,

01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:40.530 align:middle line:84%
and to try to get him to
agree that he would agree,

01:21:40.530 --> 01:21:43.330 align:middle line:84%
if he becomes
premier, to respond

01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:48.250 align:middle line:84%
to a 10% cut back in the United
States military warheads.

01:21:48.250 --> 01:21:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said the US isn't
really ever going to do that.

01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:53.310 align:middle line:84%
I'll have to take
that initiative.

01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:54.400 align:middle line:90%
And so he did.

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:58.910 align:middle line:84%
When he became the premier, the
president of Russia in 1985,

01:21:58.910 --> 01:22:04.040 align:middle line:84%
he began the process of
Perestroika and Glasnost.

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And he began the
process of starting

01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:07.780 align:middle line:84%
to disassemble some
of the missiles,

01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and reaching out to
the United States.

01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And by that time,
actually George HW Bush

01:22:13.530 --> 01:22:17.030 align:middle line:84%
had become vice
president under Reagan,

01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:20.320 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the October
Surprise, which brought them

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:21.170 align:middle line:90%
into power.

01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And so when Reagan
went to "Ves-ne-eck,"

01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:31.580 align:middle line:84%
whatever it was up in Iceland
and sat down with Gorbachev,

01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Gorbachev recommended to Reagan,
why don't we disassemble all

01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:37.635 align:middle line:84%
the nuclear warheads,
both of our sites?

01:22:37.635 --> 01:22:39.860 align:middle line:90%
And Reagan agreed to do it.

01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And so all of Reagan's
people, headed up

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:48.440 align:middle line:84%
by George Herbert Walker
Bush, all said absolutely not,

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:49.480 align:middle line:90%
you can't do that.

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And so they just
defied him, even

01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:52.580 align:middle line:84%
though he was going to
enter into the agreement

01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:53.430 align:middle line:90%
with Khrushchev.

01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:54.240 align:middle line:90%
They said, you can't do that.

01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Who do you think you
are, president, you know,

01:22:56.220 --> 01:22:57.020 align:middle line:90%
because he wasn't.

01:22:57.020 --> 01:23:00.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, actually Bush was
the functional president.

01:23:00.250 --> 01:23:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And so they stopped
that whole agreement.

01:23:02.250 --> 01:23:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And so the Iran-Contra crisis
began with the fall of Samoza

01:23:08.690 --> 01:23:11.080 align:middle line:84%
in Nicaragua and the
fall of the Shah of Iran,

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:15.317 align:middle line:84%
because this cabal continued
to try to overthrow

01:23:15.317 --> 01:23:16.150 align:middle line:90%
the new governments.

01:23:16.150 --> 01:23:17.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

01:23:17.130 --> 01:23:18.290 align:middle line:84%
It just moved to
the Middle East.

01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:19.090 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: Yes.

01:23:19.090 --> 01:23:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And so we were involved
in all of that,

01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:23.570 align:middle line:84%
are the Jesuit
national headquarters.

01:23:23.570 --> 01:23:26.090 align:middle line:84%
We're players in
all of that process.

01:23:26.090 --> 01:23:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And so when we filed the lawsuit
against the off-the-shelf

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:33.050 align:middle line:84%
enterprise, and we put in
a lawsuit that laid out

01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:36.080 align:middle line:84%
all this history, that
laid out all the way back

01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:39.940 align:middle line:84%
to 1959 and the drug smuggling
and the heroin smuggling

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:40.820 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:43.320 align:middle line:84%
We laid it all out in a
major federal complaint.

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And the entire cabal
went ballistic over this.

01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And they sealed our
complaint, threatened

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:52.130 align:middle line:84%
to put me in jail if I
told anybody about it.

01:23:52.130 --> 01:23:55.030 align:middle line:84%
I went and met with Tip O'Neill,
the speaker of the house

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.840 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And then I met with
Claiborne Pell,

01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:01.220 align:middle line:84%
who was the ranking Democrat
in the Senate Foreign Relations

01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Committee, revealed
all of that to them.

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And when the Democrats retook
the Senate in the fall of 1986,

01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:12.870 align:middle line:84%
they moved into power and we
set up special select committees

01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:14.070 align:middle line:90%
to start investigating them.

01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:16.030 align:middle line:90%
The FBI was investigating them.

01:24:16.030 --> 01:24:18.980 align:middle line:84%
We went through this
entire Iran-Contra crisis

01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:23.140 align:middle line:84%
and came to the very brink of
almost impeaching Ronald Reagan

01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:27.540 align:middle line:84%
and Bush for defying Congress
and the Boland Amendment.

01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:30.340 align:middle line:90%
So we have all that history.

01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:32.900 align:middle line:84%
But beneath all of
this, as you can tell,

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:36.370 align:middle line:84%
I've been involved in all
kinds of these activities.

01:24:36.370 --> 01:24:38.410 align:middle line:84%
But it required a
much deeper analysis

01:24:38.410 --> 01:24:41.145 align:middle line:84%
of really trying to
understand what was going on.

01:24:41.145 --> 01:24:42.020 align:middle line:90%
And what you really--

01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And basically
let's just say,

01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:46.800 align:middle line:84%
all the way up until this
moment 30 years after that,

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:49.500 align:middle line:84%
the same games have been played,
a lot of the same players,

01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:52.220 align:middle line:84%
same motivations,
same institutions,

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:55.630 align:middle line:84%
military industrial complex,
banks have still been involved.

01:24:55.630 --> 01:24:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So the shenanigans
have continued,

01:24:57.450 --> 01:24:58.900 align:middle line:84%
and now we can't
take it anymore.

01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:00.920 align:middle line:84%
The same shadowy
forces are entrenched

01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:03.190 align:middle line:84%
that have been
entrenched starting back

01:25:03.190 --> 01:25:04.280 align:middle line:90%
in the days of Hitler.

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:06.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're looking
at an 80 year legacy

01:25:06.810 --> 01:25:08.250 align:middle line:90%
now with this stuff.

01:25:08.250 --> 01:25:11.170 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, so you
created the New Paradigm

01:25:11.170 --> 01:25:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Institute because
of this, because

01:25:12.770 --> 01:25:16.230 align:middle line:84%
of your deep involvement
in understanding

01:25:16.230 --> 01:25:19.440 align:middle line:84%
the philosophical nature
of these players involved.

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about the
different paradigms

01:25:23.890 --> 01:25:27.800 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their psychological
functioning, right?

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN:
Cosmological insights.

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, cosmological
insights and all of the above.

01:25:32.110 --> 01:25:33.530 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: It's
a very profound--

01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:34.637 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

01:25:34.637 --> 01:25:35.470 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: --basis.

01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:37.053 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We have
a few minutes left.

01:25:37.053 --> 01:25:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And in short, let me just
ask you this question,

01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:41.550 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's worth
people going to New Paradigm

01:25:41.550 --> 01:25:42.350 align:middle line:90%
Institute.

01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:44.410 align:middle line:90%
Is it newparadigminstitute.org?

01:25:44.410 --> 01:25:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: Well what it is
is it's presently a wholly

01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:48.750 align:middle line:84%
integrated auxiliary of
the Romero Institute.

01:25:48.750 --> 01:25:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The Romero, OK.

01:25:49.470 --> 01:25:51.380 align:middle line:10%
>> SHEEHAN: So they want to
go to the romeroinstitute.org.

01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:52.370 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Dot org, OK.

01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:54.720 align:middle line:10%
>> SHEEHAN: And then they
can look up the New Paradigm

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:56.720 align:middle line:10%
Institute under it.

01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be eventually
a separate 501(c)(3) up

01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:03.380 align:middle line:90%
at Berkeley at the university.

01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so
everyone can go there.

01:26:06.450 --> 01:26:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about-- I just
want your own point of view

01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:11.370 align:middle line:84%
on, ultimately,
what is it going--

01:26:11.370 --> 01:26:13.370 align:middle line:84%
if revolution of the
kind we talked about

01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:15.940 align:middle line:84%
is not desirable, the
Trotsky-esque kind

01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:20.320 align:middle line:84%
of revolution, then
what is it going to take

01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:22.650 align:middle line:90%
to create a serious evolution?

01:26:22.650 --> 01:26:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: Well it's going
to take the 95% of the people

01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:32.090 align:middle line:84%
in the country who never do
anything about really deciding

01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:35.250 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen in the
country except go out and vote,

01:26:35.250 --> 01:26:38.380 align:middle line:84%
60% of the people that are
eligible to go out and vote

01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:40.119 align:middle line:90%
once every four years.

01:26:40.119 --> 01:26:42.160 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take a lot
more activity than that.

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:44.540 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
mobilize and organize.

01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:47.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But what else outside
of even the political process?

01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:50.470 align:middle line:84%
We have millennials coming up
who are just so disinterested.

01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: They really need to
understand what the differences

01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:57.700 align:middle line:84%
are in these worldviews, that
it's not all one big mash

01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.740 align:middle line:84%
of people who are
all morally corrupt,

01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:02.520 align:middle line:90%
and they're not all the same.

01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:04.490 align:middle line:84%
The fact is they have
different worldviews.

01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:08.160 align:middle line:84%
There are authoritarians, who
are people like Donald Trump.

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:13.640 align:middle line:84%
There are reactionaries, who
are like Ted Cruz and Rubio.

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:16.500 align:middle line:84%
They have conservatives,
who are like Kasich

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:18.430 align:middle line:84%
and most of the leadership
of the Republican

01:27:18.430 --> 01:27:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Party, the traditional
Republican party.

01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And then there are moderates,
which is the new more moderate

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.930 align:middle line:90%
Democratic Party.

01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:30.870 align:middle line:84%
This is not only Hillary Clinton
but Bill Clinton and Barack

01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Obama and all the
major leadership

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:36.050 align:middle line:84%
of the Democratic
Party right now.

01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:37.365 align:middle line:90%
Then there are liberals.

01:27:37.365 --> 01:27:40.808 align:middle line:90%


01:27:40.808 --> 01:27:42.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a Progressive
Caucus that's

01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:44.810 align:middle line:90%
in the House of Representatives.

01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:46.964 align:middle line:84%
And most all of them
are really liberals.

01:27:46.964 --> 01:27:48.380 align:middle line:84%
They call themselves
progressives,

01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:50.250 align:middle line:90%
but they're major liberals.

01:27:50.250 --> 01:27:52.800 align:middle line:84%
The progressives
are the only ones

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:56.390 align:middle line:84%
who are really going to be able
to have the kind of insights

01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:59.870 align:middle line:84%
to organize and
to mobilize people

01:27:59.870 --> 01:28:02.480 align:middle line:84%
to be able to combat
the reactionary

01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:04.470 align:middle line:90%
and the authoritarians.

01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:06.840 align:middle line:90%
That's always been true.

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And so they really
need to understand

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:10.840 align:middle line:84%
what the underlying
belief systems are

01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:13.460 align:middle line:90%
of true progressives.

01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And their utopianists, which
are another worldview, which

01:28:16.570 --> 01:28:19.420 align:middle line:84%
are the theists, that
are the utopianists who

01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:21.320 align:middle line:84%
believe in meditating
and raising people's

01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:23.490 align:middle line:90%
consciousness and all that.

01:28:23.490 --> 01:28:26.520 align:middle line:84%
But the cutting edge is
going to be the progressives,

01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:30.110 align:middle line:84%
the development of a genuine
progressive party in the United

01:28:30.110 --> 01:28:30.910 align:middle line:90%
States.

01:28:30.910 --> 01:28:32.680 align:middle line:90%
It has to be conceived of.

01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:33.900 align:middle line:90%
It has to be mobilized.

01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:35.270 align:middle line:90%
It has to be organized.

01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:36.360 align:middle line:90%
That's what has to happen.

01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:39.294 align:middle line:84%
Because that's going to
inspire the millennials.

01:28:39.294 --> 01:28:41.210 align:middle line:84%
It's going to inspire a
lot of the people that

01:28:41.210 --> 01:28:43.570 align:middle line:84%
are disenchanted with
the present business

01:28:43.570 --> 01:28:45.210 align:middle line:90%
as usual operation.

01:28:45.210 --> 01:28:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be what
the dark forces in the cabal

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:52.970 align:middle line:84%
recognize as those who
can really unseat them.

01:28:52.970 --> 01:28:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
mobilize against that.

01:28:55.130 --> 01:28:58.790 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that the
alliance between the baby

01:28:58.790 --> 01:29:01.380 align:middle line:84%
boomer generation,
82 million of us,

01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:05.210 align:middle line:84%
and the millennial generation,
75 million of the kids,

01:29:05.210 --> 01:29:08.650 align:middle line:84%
have the power to organize
together and pursue

01:29:08.650 --> 01:29:13.500 align:middle line:84%
a progressive agenda that really
has what many people are going

01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:16.340 align:middle line:84%
to perceive as kind of a
spiritual dimension to it.

01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:19.950 align:middle line:84%
It is going to get behind
stopping global climate change,

01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:21.510 align:middle line:84%
undertaking the
radical changes that

01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:24.690 align:middle line:84%
are necessary, because these
people are all mobilizing

01:29:24.690 --> 01:29:26.910 align:middle line:84%
to allow global climate
change to take place,

01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:31.010 align:middle line:90%
to destroy basic civilization.

01:29:31.010 --> 01:29:33.430 align:middle line:84%
They're so attached to
the petroleum corporations

01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:35.530 align:middle line:84%
and the energy
corporations that they're

01:29:35.530 --> 01:29:37.170 align:middle line:90%
going to allow this to happen.

01:29:37.170 --> 01:29:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So we have to, for our
own self preservation,

01:29:39.790 --> 01:29:42.940 align:middle line:84%
we have to mobilize a new
progressive political party

01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:46.140 align:middle line:84%
that is spiritually informed,
which differentiates it

01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:48.250 align:middle line:84%
from just the Green
Party, because it's

01:29:48.250 --> 01:29:50.430 align:middle line:90%
a purely secular party.

01:29:50.430 --> 01:29:53.050 align:middle line:84%
We've got to have a kind
of a spiritual vision.

01:29:53.050 --> 01:29:54.690 align:middle line:84%
We've got to have a
progressive vision.

01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
mobilize and organize,

01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:59.980 align:middle line:84%
I believe, a new political
party to actually take

01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:01.577 align:middle line:90%
power in the United States.

01:30:01.577 --> 01:30:04.160 align:middle line:84%
They should come to the Romero
Institute, romeroinstitute.org,

01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:07.620 align:middle line:84%
and click onto the
New Paradigm Institute

01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:10.230 align:middle line:84%
to come to understand
what that's all about.

01:30:10.230 --> 01:30:13.540 align:middle line:10%
And understand, as a
501c3, we can't directly

01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:15.780 align:middle line:10%
organize the new
progressive political party.

01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:17.510 align:middle line:90%
That needs to be done by others.

01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:18.810 align:middle line:90%
And that needs to get set up.

01:30:18.810 --> 01:30:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're laying the
foundation and the education.

01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:23.888 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: Perfectly willing
to be legal counsel for that.

01:30:23.888 --> 01:30:26.159 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Of course you
are, as everyone else is.

01:30:26.159 --> 01:30:27.450 align:middle line:90%
>> SHEEHAN: We can set that up.

01:30:27.450 --> 01:30:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: With that, thank
you again for your time.

01:30:29.410 --> 01:30:30.410 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

01:30:30.410 --> 01:30:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>> SHEEHAN: It's my
pleasure for sure.

01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:34.678 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I know you probably
need to watch this one a few

01:30:34.678 --> 01:30:37.355 align:middle line:84%
times, maybe even have to
take some mind enhancing herbs

01:30:37.355 --> 01:30:38.230 align:middle line:90%
to follow the thread.

01:30:38.230 --> 01:30:40.410 align:middle line:84%
But what's abundantly
clear is that the levels

01:30:40.410 --> 01:30:42.770 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that have
run our planet until now

01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:43.730 align:middle line:90%
are obsolete.

01:30:43.730 --> 01:30:45.180 align:middle line:10%
