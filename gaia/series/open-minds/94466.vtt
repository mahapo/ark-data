>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Most of us can

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.590 align:middle line:84%
feel the pain of the crumbling
old structures around us.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.560 align:middle line:10%
The anxiety often
comes in not knowing

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.180 align:middle line:10%
what the future holds for our
children and grandchildren.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Author Kingsley Dennis
says that their future

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.410 align:middle line:84%
is going to be more innovative,
creative, and whole.

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Dennis thank you from
flying all the way to Spain

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.150 align:middle line:84%
to our little studio
here in London.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm really intrigued
with your work,

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.720 align:middle line:84%
because I look at what we have
left the next generations,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.760 align:middle line:84%
which isn't much-- not
economically, socially,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.710 align:middle line:90%
or otherwise.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking
about the fact

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.730 align:middle line:84%
that it doesn't
matter, because these

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.440 align:middle line:84%
are an entirely different
kind of beings, so to speak,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.900 align:middle line:84%
that are going to create the
world in a new way, called

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.000 align:middle line:90%
the phoenix generation.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.419 align:middle line:84%
And so before we get into
what the phoenix generation is

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:13.960 align:middle line:84%
and what you expect
from them, do you

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.730 align:middle line:90%
mind if I read from your book?

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.050 align:middle line:84%
It was right up front, a
quote from Buckminster Fuller.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.380 align:middle line:84%
It says, "Traditional
human power structures

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.270 align:middle line:84%
and their reign of darkness are
about to be rendered obsolete,

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.630 align:middle line:84%
not taken asunder, but
rendered obsolete."

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.320 align:middle line:84%
So explain why you
put that up front.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>>KINGSLEY DENNIS:
Oh, thank you, Regina.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.930 align:middle line:10%
Buckminster Fuller was a
visionary in his own right,

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.850 align:middle line:10%
and he was-- he knew very
well how things change,

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.350 align:middle line:10%
how systems change.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.840 align:middle line:10%
And that is not necessarily
a case of things

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.940 align:middle line:10%
happening overnight.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.690 align:middle line:84%
But how do we bring
in the new models?

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And he knew, way back
then, many decades before,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:84%
that we're dealing with
incumbent systems that

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.015 align:middle line:84%
are obsolete, and they've
passed their due date.

00:02:01.015 --> 00:02:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to also
refer to another quote

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.200 align:middle line:84%
from Buckminster
Fuller, which I also

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.110 align:middle line:90%
think hits the nail on the head.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And he said that, "we don't
fight the existing reality.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.970 align:middle line:84%
We need to create
new models that

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.900 align:middle line:84%
make the existing
reality obsolete."

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And what he's
referring to is how

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:84%
we need to respond
to incumbent systems

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and that often the first wave,
the first reaction or response,

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.080 align:middle line:84%
which is very human, when we
see the inequality in the world,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.290 align:middle line:84%
is that we wish to fight
against it directly.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.200 align:middle line:84%
We wish to protest,
which we often see now,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:84%
in the first wave
reactions around the world.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, this other approach,
the other response,

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.870 align:middle line:84%
which is coming in over time,
is that rather than protest

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:84%
head on, which only really
strengthens incumbent systems

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.317 align:middle line:84%
and gives the
present status quo.

00:02:55.317 --> 00:02:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everyone entrenches
into their position.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.025 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: Yeah.

00:02:58.025 --> 00:02:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And it gives them
more power to look

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.060 align:middle line:84%
at what we're dealing
with, back into propaganda.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: So what Buckminster
Fuller is referring to--

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.420 align:middle line:84%
and I quote also in the
book-- is how we need

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.720 align:middle line:84%
and how the phoenix
generation, we're

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.720 align:middle line:84%
part of that incoming wave
that will be more savvy, more

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.220 align:middle line:84%
instinctual, and will have an
understanding that in order

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.310 align:middle line:84%
to make real change,
long-term change,

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.360 align:middle line:84%
it's about bypassing
the incumbent systems

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.180 align:middle line:84%
and creating new models
that eventually will just

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.110 align:middle line:90%
outgrow and overtake.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.412 align:middle line:84%
They will replace
the existing systems.

00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
makes perfect sense.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's how nature
works, isn't it?

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And everything human
beings have been doing

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.250 align:middle line:84%
is going against nature,
thinking we can somehow

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.806 align:middle line:84%
go against natural
principles and have it work.

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:44.430 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.570 align:middle line:84%
As you say, it just reinforces
already obsolete and not

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.180 align:middle line:84%
particularly healthy
systems, right?

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.540 align:middle line:84%
So now we can go
into-- and we will

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.450 align:middle line:84%
have a few airplanes flying
overhead, because all of London

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.650 align:middle line:84%
is in the Heathrow
flight path, right?

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.260 align:middle line:84%
So we'll hear little bit of
that shadow in the background.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.280 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
phoenix generation itself,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.410 align:middle line:84%
the years we're talking about,
when these people were born,

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.140 align:middle line:84%
when they will be coming
of age and into power.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.519 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: When I name
the phoenix generation,

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.899 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about a generation
that are being born around now,

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.290 align:middle line:84%
in the years now,
a few years before,

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.620 align:middle line:84%
but will come of
age around 2030.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So kind
of 2010 onward.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: Yeah.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And also because
around 2030, they

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.880 align:middle line:84%
will be coming of age in a way
that they will be entering--

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.686 align:middle line:84%
entering the workforce,
entering systems--

00:04:41.686 --> 00:04:46.320 align:middle line:84%
and will have a greater capacity
to engage with those systems.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.540 align:middle line:90%
So we're dealing with them now.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.120 align:middle line:84%
But of course, they're also a
part of a second or third wave,

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.490 align:middle line:84%
because they've been
coming in for a while,

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.941 align:middle line:90%
but in very-- in lower numbers.

00:04:58.941 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about the
generation right before them,

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.130 align:middle line:84%
the ones that started coming
in, say, around late '90s, 2000?

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
kind of interesting.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, each wave
is sort of built

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.800 align:middle line:84%
upon the one before, right,
in laying the foundation.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle line:84%
What is the one that is around
18 years of age right now?

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.650 align:middle line:84%
What have they laid,
by way of a foundation,

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.050 align:middle line:84%
for this incoming
phoenix generation?

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: Well,
the earlier wave,

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.320 align:middle line:84%
they often-- I feel
that, in fact, they've

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.830 align:middle line:84%
had a harder time,
because of one way

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.500 align:middle line:84%
is that they've come
into a system which

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.350 align:middle line:84%
is more difficult,
more intangible

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.000 align:middle line:90%
for them to deal with.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And also, I feel part
of the responsibility

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.370 align:middle line:84%
is from our side, because
we've stigmatized them.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that
is, some of the earlier

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.600 align:middle line:84%
references to them, we're
familiar with-- the indigo

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.590 align:middle line:90%
children, for example.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.122 align:middle line:84%
And they've been named crystal
children, star children.

00:05:54.122 --> 00:05:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're talking
about the phoenix generation

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.635 align:middle line:90%
right now, or the one before?

00:05:57.635 --> 00:05:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: One before.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.509 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, all right.

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:00.115 align:middle line:90%
Gotcha.

00:06:00.115 --> 00:06:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: So the
earlier wave-- and there

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.430 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of news about
calling them indigo children.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And there were
comment about they

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.010 align:middle line:84%
had maybe super-psychic
abilities.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think we went off in
slightly a different direction.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, going back to the--
that earlier stage.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, the indigo, the
origin of the indigo

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:28.070 align:middle line:84%
is because-- I think it
refers to Nancy Ann Tappe, who

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.950 align:middle line:84%
had a neurological condition
called synesthesia,

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.950 align:middle line:90%
where she saw people as colors.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And so she saw people's
behavior and attitude as colors.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And so that under-- people's
behaviors and attitudes

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.250 align:middle line:90%
came across.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And she saw the new color
coming in as indigo,

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.160 align:middle line:84%
more children come in
with that behavior.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, it didn't suggest that
they were super-psychic.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.380 align:middle line:84%
It's just they did
things differently.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.915 align:middle line:84%
They were having
different perspectives.

00:06:56.915 --> 00:07:00.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, I feel that we did a
slight disservice to them

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.460 align:middle line:90%
by over-stigmatizing them.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.440 align:middle line:90%
They are indigo.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.900 align:middle line:84%
They're going to change
the world suddenly.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we saw instances
where they really

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.590 align:middle line:84%
just-- a lot of them
hit, slapped face-on

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.570 align:middle line:90%
with the systems.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.040 align:middle line:90%
They had difficulties.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.547 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, there was a huge
spurt in autism at that time,

00:07:19.547 --> 00:07:20.630 align:middle line:90%
too, certainly in America.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.746 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about Britain.

00:07:22.746 --> 00:07:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: True.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think the terminology
and understanding

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.160 align:middle line:90%
got slightly mixed.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle line:84%
My feeling is that
those known as indigo

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.600 align:middle line:84%
were just an earlier wave
of young children being

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.474 align:middle line:90%
born with different wiring.

00:07:35.474 --> 00:07:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're talking
about with the phoenix

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.740 align:middle line:90%
generation.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.830 align:middle line:84%
It's that they're coming
with a different wiring.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.038 align:middle line:90%
They're thinking differently.

00:07:42.038 --> 00:07:44.390 align:middle line:84%
They understand
concepts differently.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And importantly,
they're shifting

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:50.870 align:middle line:84%
from relying on
acquired information.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Now acquired information--

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to go
deeply into that, because, yes.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:59.060 align:middle line:84%
They were born into the matrix
as it's been shifting already,

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.820 align:middle line:84%
and so it's been laid
for them, both on kind

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.090 align:middle line:84%
of a programmed
level, energetically,

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.495 align:middle line:84%
and in terms of data, what
they can have access to.

00:08:08.495 --> 00:08:10.090 align:middle line:90%
I find that really fascinating.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.070 align:middle line:84%
But you say that they're--
it's not going to be the end

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.990 align:middle line:84%
We've all-- the other
past generations

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.150 align:middle line:84%
have all been looking for the
end of a way, the end of this,

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.264 align:middle line:90%
the end of times.

00:08:21.264 --> 00:08:22.680 align:middle line:84%
You're saying it's
not about that.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: No, I don't
think there is an end.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:28.210 align:middle line:84%
I think, really, we've been
focusing too much on the end.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And we can talk all day
about 2012 and where

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.564 align:middle line:84%
that kind of grew
and that phenomenon.

00:08:33.564 --> 00:08:37.179 align:middle line:84%
But really, there's been too
much talk about end times

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:38.360 align:middle line:90%
or the end of this.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Really, if we look at the whole
history of human civilization

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.980 align:middle line:84%
and the whole growth
of human consciousness,

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.250 align:middle line:84%
it's about evolving
systems, in terms

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:52.600 align:middle line:84%
of civilization and ongoing
evolving consciousness.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.870 align:middle line:90%
There has been no end.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:56.190 align:middle line:84%
There's just been
different phases.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.320 align:middle line:84%
So we can see
transition moments.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And within that
transition moment,

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:07.430 align:middle line:84%
we can see there has been end
of some patterns of thinking.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:08.060 align:middle line:90%
We can go back.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.220 align:middle line:84%
There's a classic one we say
now-- the leap from the world

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.676 align:middle line:90%
was flat to the world was round.

00:09:13.676 --> 00:09:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
that's what you say

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.960 align:middle line:84%
the phoenix
generation brings in,

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.890 align:middle line:84%
that degree of shift in
consciousness and awareness.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: I do feel
that we'll look back

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.990 align:middle line:84%
on this time as being as
significant as shifting

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.120 align:middle line:84%
from a flat earth
to a round earth.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Because when we have
that shift, it's

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.880 align:middle line:84%
a shift in perspectives,
a shift in perception,

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.920 align:middle line:84%
a shift in the capacity
of consciousness

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.370 align:middle line:84%
to affect our social
systems and civilization.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.490 align:middle line:90%
They're convergent points.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:45.300 align:middle line:84%
So we have smaller
transitions, smaller movements.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
times in human history

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.760 align:middle line:90%
when everything converges.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.855 align:middle line:84%
And that makes it
a grander moment.

00:09:51.855 --> 00:09:55.035 align:middle line:84%
And that, I feel, is what's
coming in now at the same time

00:09:55.035 --> 00:09:57.050 align:middle line:84%
frame, a generational
time frame,

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.430 align:middle line:90%
as the phoenix generation.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:59.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.750 align:middle line:84%
If we can divert for just a
moment, because I was intrigued

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:05.339 align:middle line:84%
a moment ago when you said, I
can go on about the 2012 thing.

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you gone on a
bit about the 2012 thing?

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.588 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll pick it back up
with the phoenix children.

00:10:09.588 --> 00:10:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And we need to look
at these-- I don't

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.220 align:middle line:84%
know if you call it an agenda,
that have been laid out for us,

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.350 align:middle line:84%
where everyone essentially
goes into fear mode and fear

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.420 align:middle line:84%
patterns, which is what
happened over 2012.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.855 align:middle line:90%
Tell us your take on 2012.

00:10:24.855 --> 00:10:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: Well, I think
it's fairly obvious now,

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:32.120 align:middle line:84%
when we look back on it, that it
was-- the information was also

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.900 align:middle line:90%
hijacked, as well.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
information was manipulated

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.100 align:middle line:84%
to turn this-- initially
this understanding

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.830 align:middle line:84%
that it's a moment of great
change into a new cycle

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.471 align:middle line:84%
into something
that's the end times.

00:10:45.471 --> 00:10:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Somehow, it became
mixed up with apocalyptic news.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:48.435 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: Yeah.

00:10:48.435 --> 00:10:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: We've always
had those moments.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.980 align:middle line:84%
We had a smaller moment
in the Millennium bug,

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.080 align:middle line:84%
when it was changing to, oh,
dear, we've reached 2000.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.960 align:middle line:84%
All the planes are going
to drop out of the sky.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.900 align:middle line:90%
Fear is a great propaganda tool.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, fear really
is the main energy

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.930 align:middle line:90%
of mainstream traditional news.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.723 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: I mean, if
you look at propaganda,

00:11:11.723 --> 00:11:13.890 align:middle line:84%
the history of propaganda,
which was set up--

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.830 align:middle line:84%
one of the godfathers of
propaganda was Edward Bernays.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.500 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful documentary
called, "The Century of Self."

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.350 align:middle line:84%
So anyone who hasn't
seen that, I highly

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.370 align:middle line:84%
recommend them watching
"The Century of Self,"

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.450 align:middle line:84%
very revealing, to see
just how manipulated

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.160 align:middle line:90%
the fabric of society has been.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: And that
matrix of misinformation,

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.430 align:middle line:90%
it absorbed 2012.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the factors of
2012 which were against us

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.850 align:middle line:84%
was it put people in limbo,
in that we didn't quite

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.970 align:middle line:84%
know what was going
to happen post-2012.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Were we going to
ascend somewhere?

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Or were we going to just
completely evaporate?

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:56.114 align:middle line:84%
So people were
waiting, and waiting

00:11:56.114 --> 00:11:57.780 align:middle line:84%
to really understand
what was happening.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think that took away
some of our activity, in that I

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.160 align:middle line:84%
think there's been a
greater energetic spurt

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.930 align:middle line:84%
of creative projects
and new thinking

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.595 align:middle line:84%
post 2012 because people
have realized that--

00:12:10.595 --> 00:12:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was on pause, yes.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't just a
new age projection;

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:19.080 align:middle line:84%
it was lining up with
fundamentalist Christianity,

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.130 align:middle line:84%
for example, where a lot of
these stories and looking

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:25.180 align:middle line:84%
for the signs at the end were
starting to align together.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.510 align:middle line:84%
So you had, really,
a large percentage

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.010 align:middle line:84%
of the population--
if you then expand it

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:33.740 align:middle line:84%
to that population--
expecting some kind of end.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, life is on pause.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.370 align:middle line:84%
You're not really striving
for anything at that point,

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:38.190 align:middle line:90%
like you said.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And these children were
being born during that time.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:41.410 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: Exactly.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And what type of--
those messages

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.250 align:middle line:84%
were-- it was a
showcase of where,

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.045 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, some
[INAUDIBLE] in humanity

00:12:49.045 --> 00:12:51.820 align:middle line:90%
in this 2012 confusion.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.820 align:middle line:84%
So what kind of message is that
to give to people coming in,

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:55.970 align:middle line:90%
the new generation?

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:58.180 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm saying
is that they're not

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.590 align:middle line:90%
going to pick up on that.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:03.266 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well,
that's your thing.

00:13:03.266 --> 00:13:05.690 align:middle line:84%
But the generation
coming in now,

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.640 align:middle line:84%
I feel that they can
have completely a say,

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.098 align:middle line:84%
a different
understanding, which is

00:13:09.098 --> 00:13:13.470 align:middle line:84%
why they had less faith in
the acquired information,

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:17.500 align:middle line:84%
or less contact with
social conditioning.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's a major factor,
which has slowed down

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:25.040 align:middle line:84%
a great generational change,
is social conditioning.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Or another word for that
is social engineering.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And social engineering
has been a major component

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.830 align:middle line:84%
of human civilization, human
societies, for centuries,

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.690 align:middle line:84%
whether we go back to the
priestly castes centuries ago.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.190 align:middle line:84%
All the way down
the line, there has

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.640 align:middle line:84%
been institutions
that have tried

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.220 align:middle line:84%
to socially condition the
populous, because that's

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.660 align:middle line:84%
the main thing is
that force for change

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.740 align:middle line:84%
will have to come
through the individuals.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's the tug of war
which is happening now

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.930 align:middle line:84%
in this transition and
which will play out

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:58.690 align:middle line:84%
in the generation
coming in, this tug

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:03.970 align:middle line:84%
of war between hierarchical
institutions and the more

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:07.550 align:middle line:84%
decentralized connectivity
and power and energy

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:08.710 align:middle line:90%
between the individuals.

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's take a moment
and go back even further, just

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.060 align:middle line:90%
a little bit.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.061 align:middle line:84%
We can't just negate an
entire generation of people.

00:14:16.061 --> 00:14:18.560 align:middle line:84%
There have been advances that
have been made that have maybe

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.410 align:middle line:84%
put some other things in
place they'll have access to,

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.950 align:middle line:84%
by way of our generation and
even our parents' generation.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.510 align:middle line:84%
So maybe just hopscotch
quickly through that,

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:31.230 align:middle line:84%
in your mind, what each
one laid foundationally

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:34.170 align:middle line:84%
for the next that was
really necessary as tools

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:35.443 align:middle line:90%
for the next one.

00:14:35.443 --> 00:14:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: Sure.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.660 align:middle line:84%
Very necessary, and we
can't negate it at all.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.880 align:middle line:84%
There's an Eastern
proverb which says,

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.920 align:middle line:84%
"You will ride your donkey
to the door of your house,

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:84%
but you won't ride
it into your house."

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And maybe one layer of
meaning that suggests

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.820 align:middle line:84%
is that we have one vehicle
to get us to one place.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And then, when
it's time, we need

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.920 align:middle line:84%
to get off and take a different
mode of transport, for example.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, the evolution
of consciousness

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.390 align:middle line:84%
has been increasing
throughout time.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.210 align:middle line:90%
Now, it may not seem that way.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.400 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the history
of the 20th century,

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.350 align:middle line:84%
it looks like a history
of warfare, destruction.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And things have been
going down hill.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you look
at the vocabulary

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and the understanding of the
inner world of the human being,

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.650 align:middle line:84%
in fact, there's been
an ongoing increase.

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, for example,
if we look at, let's

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.150 align:middle line:84%
say, the second half
of the 19th century,

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.040 align:middle line:84%
we had the growth of the
Transcendentalist movement,

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.690 align:middle line:90%
in America, especially.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:84%
We had the Theosophy
in movement.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.350 align:middle line:84%
We had the growth in
seances, in people

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:43.580 align:middle line:84%
trying to connect
with life after death.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Then we had the
initial stirrings

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:50.450 align:middle line:84%
of psychiatry and
Freud and Jung.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And Wilhelm Reich also,
bringing the vocabulary

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:56.955 align:middle line:84%
of how to access and
understand the inner world.

00:15:56.955 --> 00:16:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Then we had a wave of
teachers and teaching

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:02.730 align:middle line:84%
coming over into the
West from the East.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:05.790 align:middle line:90%
We had Yogananda coming over.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:08.080 align:middle line:84%
We had a lot of
other Zen teachings,

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.480 align:middle line:90%
a lot of Sufi teachers.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.140 align:middle line:84%
And then that went into
the wave of, let's say,

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.700 align:middle line:84%
postwar '50s and
'60s, where there's

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:19.230 align:middle line:84%
a great deal of experimentalism
with the inner world,

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:23.200 align:middle line:84%
a great initial contact
with shamanic practices.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exploration of
near-death experiences,

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.280 align:middle line:84%
out of body
experiences, all of it.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:27.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: Channeling, contact
with other intelligences,

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.530 align:middle line:84%
the growth of the transcendental
psychology movement,

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:36.660 align:middle line:84%
meditation-- and so
for example, if we

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.950 align:middle line:84%
spoke with our grandparents
and said, oh, sorry,

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:41.604 align:middle line:90%
I had a Freudian slip.

00:16:41.604 --> 00:16:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Our grandparents would probably
answer, well, who's Freud,

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.810 align:middle line:90%
and where did he slip?

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't have
that vocabulary or language

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.760 align:middle line:84%
to try to reflect
upon the inner world.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.800 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at the inner
world different from what

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.810 align:middle line:84%
we see in propaganda
from the outer world--

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:57.893 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Externally, yes.

00:16:57.893 --> 00:17:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: --we see,
in fact, a revolution

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.260 align:middle line:84%
that's been ongoing
in how we access

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.319 align:middle line:84%
and how we experiment and come
to understand the inner world.

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And now I feel that's coming
more convergent in how we then

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.804 align:middle line:90%
deal with the outer world.

00:17:12.804 --> 00:17:14.220 align:middle line:84%
We're bringing
them together, just

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.260 align:middle line:84%
like science and spirituality
is coming together

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.900 align:middle line:90%
in the fields of knowledge.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.405 align:middle line:84%
So too, I feel,
is the expression

00:17:19.405 --> 00:17:21.310 align:middle line:84%
of the inner world
coming together

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.245 align:middle line:84%
with how we deal in
our everyday life.

00:17:23.245 --> 00:17:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we did,
on an external level,

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:29.940 align:middle line:84%
bring forth, as you said in
your book, unprecedented growth,

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.960 align:middle line:90%
technological advancement.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And part of this
technological advancement

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.140 align:middle line:84%
leads us to the way-- the means
by which people are watching

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.910 align:middle line:84%
this today-- the
connectivity of online media,

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:42.010 align:middle line:84%
for example, which
brings us more

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:45.690 align:middle line:84%
to the subject of transparency,
as another example.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And these-- as you were saying
in the book, up until now,

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.000 align:middle line:84%
we all lead relatively
compartmentalized

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.230 align:middle line:84%
lives-- regions, countries,
states, neighborhoods.

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.830 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's all connected.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is the medium to which
these children are being born.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is interesting,
because our generation

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:10.080 align:middle line:84%
is suspicious of that degree
of connectivity, even Facebook,

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Who wants everyone to know
all of their data, everything

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:17.230 align:middle line:84%
they're doing, kind of the
eye on the sky mentality?

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the interface
between that and then the newer

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.490 align:middle line:84%
generation and how they're
going to feel about it,

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.500 align:middle line:84%
being bathed in
transparency from day one.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>> DENNIS: That's a
huge question, Regina.

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Take your time.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:34.204 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: The world is
shifting now into different--

00:18:34.204 --> 00:18:37.320 align:middle line:84%
a different temporal-spatial
environment.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.120 align:middle line:84%
So for example-- and
this, again, as you say,

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:44.540 align:middle line:84%
owes a great debt to the process
of the Industrial Revolution,

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.770 align:middle line:84%
bringing in the radio,
the television, which

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:51.510 align:middle line:84%
started to bring in different
forms of time and space

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:53.840 align:middle line:90%
for our parents or grandparents.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.530 align:middle line:84%
But it was mostly
one-on-one, one-way.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:57.920 align:middle line:90%
And we were receivers.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.210 align:middle line:84%
So it developed a
consumerist environment,

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.270 align:middle line:90%
where we received information.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're on the cusp
off putting in place

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.850 align:middle line:84%
the initial mechanisms
or initial birth

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:15.820 align:middle line:84%
pains of moving towards
a planetary society.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, that may put a lot of
fear into people by saying,

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.450 align:middle line:84%
oh, planetary society, one
world government, the Borg,

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:23.910 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:25.220 align:middle line:90%
That's understandable.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Because when something
new comes in, of course,

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:29.950 align:middle line:84%
the incumbent power
structures wish

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.450 align:middle line:84%
to appropriate it
for their own use.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:35.220 align:middle line:90%
So we see the surveillance.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.202 align:middle line:84%
We see the NSA, National
Security Agency.

00:19:38.202 --> 00:19:40.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, walking down
the streets of London-- CCTV

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:41.840 align:middle line:90%
cameras everywhere.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.352 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: The most
CCTV city in the world.

00:19:44.352 --> 00:19:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: My god.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.360 align:middle line:84%
You can't walk down the
street without being on film.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: So our
generation as well, we

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.940 align:middle line:84%
have that fear of, well,
this is not good for us.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Another thing we're
noticing, though,

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.120 align:middle line:84%
is that as we're become
more connected in the world,

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.570 align:middle line:84%
that time and space
interaction is actually

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.720 align:middle line:90%
creating a response nueronally.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And the young children are
being rewired differently.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a wonderful
quote that goes back

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.940 align:middle line:84%
to the 13th century from
the great Persian poet Rumi,

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.330 align:middle line:90%
Mewlana.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And Rumi said that, "New
organs of perception

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.610 align:middle line:84%
come into being
according to necessity.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:25.355 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, oh human,
increase your necessity."

00:20:25.355 --> 00:20:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it's beautiful.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: And so the
necessity is coming in now.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And so-- I mean,
there's many instances--

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.380 align:middle line:84%
we can talk about that later--
of how the young children are

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.680 align:middle line:84%
being more tactile
and more empathic.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.380 align:middle line:84%
So now, how do we look
at that perspective?

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can have the
fear perspective,

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:46.720 align:middle line:84%
which is what the incumbent
powers wish to play out.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.840 align:middle line:90%
Be careful of technology.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Be careful of the
globalization-- which

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:53.350 align:middle line:84%
was a neo-liberal
project-- because it's

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:55.070 align:middle line:90%
going to control you.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:57.490 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
though-- is it going

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:00.750 align:middle line:84%
to control or be able to control
a new consciousness, which

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:03.800 align:middle line:84%
is coming in and is going to
be using these technologies

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:04.917 align:middle line:90%
in a different way.

00:21:04.917 --> 00:21:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Talk about that.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Talk about how you see
that technology being used,

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.980 align:middle line:84%
say, 10 years out,
when these kids

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.340 align:middle line:84%
are coming into their
teenage years and such.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: Well, in
one sense, we're

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.115 align:middle line:84%
seeing the early signs
of that with the protest

00:21:19.115 --> 00:21:21.240 align:middle line:84%
revolutions around the
world, with the Arab Spring,

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.650 align:middle line:84%
for example, and the Jasmine
Revolution, that they

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:28.640 align:middle line:84%
used technologies to bypass the
communications when the state

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.720 align:middle line:84%
authorities cut
the communications.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.370 align:middle line:90%
So they're very tech savvy.

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:36.030 align:middle line:84%
But also, it's the
way of collaborating.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.600 align:middle line:84%
It's that, like you
said previously,

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.410 align:middle line:84%
we've been conditioned to have
a compartmentalized view of life

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.550 align:middle line:84%
and a compartmentalized
behaviorism,

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:47.830 align:middle line:84%
because that helps
the nation-states.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:54.060 align:middle line:84%
That helps to support this
divided world-- them versus us.

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.080 align:middle line:84%
But the empathic
consciousness, which

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.600 align:middle line:84%
is going to be empowered
through this collaborative,

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.980 align:middle line:84%
connective society, that
empathic consciousness is not

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.290 align:middle line:84%
going to feel-- not
going to feel into

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:09.050 align:middle line:84%
or even play out the
same them versus us.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at, for
example, manifestations

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.890 align:middle line:90%
in the Middle East.

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, the big players,
the older generation

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.630 align:middle line:84%
or what I call the old guard,
they're standing up and saying,

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:21.750 align:middle line:84%
we have to be at war
with these people.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:22.949 align:middle line:90%
They're against us.

00:22:22.949 --> 00:22:24.990 align:middle line:84%
What they're not showing
us is the younger people

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.020 align:middle line:90%
on the ground.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:26.980 align:middle line:90%
They want peace.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.480 align:middle line:90%
They want to connect.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And so they're using
social networking

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.495 align:middle line:84%
to connect with others, like
minded, across the barriers

00:22:35.495 --> 00:22:38.800 align:middle line:84%
or across the so-called
artificial barriers.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.150 align:middle line:90%
And they're reaching out.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:42.530 align:middle line:90%
So it's a different level.

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:45.640 align:middle line:84%
It's a decentralized,
distributed connectivity

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.180 align:middle line:84%
which is coming
in, and that is--

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.795 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA:
Decentralization, keyword.

00:22:49.795 --> 00:22:52.285 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: And empathic
consciousness as well.

00:22:52.285 --> 00:22:54.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
interesting, because we're

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.850 align:middle line:84%
talking about global structures,
global governments, perhaps

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.930 align:middle line:84%
even global economies,
and decentralization

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:04.400 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.024 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:23:05.024 --> 00:23:06.815 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: It's the two
agendas playing out.

00:23:06.815 --> 00:23:07.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: For example, we're
at the end of empires now.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Yours went down, and
now ours is going down.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.910 align:middle line:90%


00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: The boat is sinking.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:23.332 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: You see, let's take
the metaphor of drowning.

00:23:23.332 --> 00:23:28.120 align:middle line:84%
A drowning person is a
person who struggles more.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they say,
be careful if you go

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.370 align:middle line:84%
and try to save a
drowning person,

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:33.090 align:middle line:84%
because they may take
you down with them.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Because they're struggling,
and they're struggling.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.336 align:middle line:84%
And they're in
their death throes.

00:23:36.336 --> 00:23:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's a dangerous
place to be.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:41.030 align:middle line:84%
So now, people
may say, well, you

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.980 align:middle line:84%
have a positive
view of the future.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.010 align:middle line:84%
But what about what
we see in the world?

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:47.970 align:middle line:84%
My response is, well, I'm
looking at the long term.

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:50.810 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
shorter term, then we're

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:53.940 align:middle line:84%
seeing these death throes,
which are quite dangerous.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:57.817 align:middle line:84%
And they are creating the
disruption and the disharmony.

00:23:57.817 --> 00:23:59.347 align:middle line:90%
And they're the negative energy.

00:23:59.347 --> 00:24:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they're
quite necessary.

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:03.702 align:middle line:84%
It's just a part of
the process of change.

00:24:03.702 --> 00:24:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: And again, I think
humanity, by our very nature,

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:11.770 align:middle line:84%
has a short term-- history
of short-term view.

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:14.430 align:middle line:84%
If we look back at the
history of civilizations--

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and forgive me, because my
background is sociology.

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:21.180 align:middle line:84%
I did come through
that academic field.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And we see how
civilizations, they

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.090 align:middle line:90%
go through a rise and a fall.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.790 align:middle line:84%
But in fact often when
they're taking over,

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:31.910 align:middle line:84%
the new power that comes in
doesn't come from the center.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:34.190 align:middle line:90%
It comes from the periphery.

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Because the center tries to
hold out, tries to hold out,

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:40.860 align:middle line:84%
tries to centralize their
power, but they can no longer

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.810 align:middle line:84%
maintain a coherence
with the periphery.

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And so they fold, and
the new energies--

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:49.130 align:middle line:84%
such as the fall of Rome was
because the Visigoths came in

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.610 align:middle line:90%
from the periphery.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:53.325 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I'm saying is that
the individuals of this world

00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:55.790 align:middle line:84%
are going to come in
from the periphery,

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:59.045 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to be
connected like never before.

00:24:59.045 --> 00:25:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And that is why
there's a greater

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.940 align:middle line:90%
fear with the authorities.

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Because they see it
coming, and they don't know

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.600 align:middle line:90%
how to deal with it.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Their only response,
with the old mind,

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:12.050 align:middle line:84%
is to increase the
centralized power structures.

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:14.810 align:middle line:84%
It's an old paradigm
response, but it's not

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:16.804 align:middle line:84%
going to play out
in the long term

00:25:16.804 --> 00:25:18.470 align:middle line:84%
because it can't hold
off the periphery.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It can't hold,
because it's actually

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.200 align:middle line:84%
a wholesale shift
in consciousness

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.420 align:middle line:84%
by that point, in which the
people aren't fearing other.

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.260 align:middle line:84%
They've been connected
with-- kids in UK

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.990 align:middle line:84%
have been connected with
the kids in the Ukraine

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:35.760 align:middle line:90%
during all of this.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.094 align:middle line:84%
They're learning about
each other's strife,

00:25:38.094 --> 00:25:39.260 align:middle line:90%
in friendships and so forth.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.740 align:middle line:90%
But let's go beyond that.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.370 align:middle line:84%
As you say, this
generation is going

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:45.080 align:middle line:84%
to be more empathic
and more intuitive,

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.320 align:middle line:84%
meaning the senses,
our finer senses,

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:51.260 align:middle line:84%
will be opening up, beginning
with-- and en masse-- beginning

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.700 align:middle line:84%
with that generation,
meaning there

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.900 align:middle line:84%
is no such thing as
compartmentalization.

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:58.900 align:middle line:90%
You can't hide.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.530 align:middle line:84%
In that sense, that's
where-- I don't like the fact

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:03.980 align:middle line:84%
that my data is all over
the place on the computer,

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.730 align:middle line:84%
and agencies and
whoever might have that.

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:09.270 align:middle line:84%
But the reality
is, they're more--

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.440 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing to hide
because you can't hide.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.240 align:middle line:84%
If you have those kinds of
instincts highly developed,

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.130 align:middle line:90%
what's to hide?

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:18.740 align:middle line:84%
You can't hide from that
degree of consciousness.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:22.707 align:middle line:84%
You can't hide from that
visibility with others, right?

00:26:22.707 --> 00:26:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: It's true.

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly-- again,
that's our social conditioning

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:29.972 align:middle line:84%
is the fear of this
information coming out.

00:26:29.972 --> 00:26:31.930 align:middle line:84%
But the key word I think
you mentioned earlier,

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:34.070 align:middle line:90%
Regina, is transparency.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.565 align:middle line:84%
Is that the transparency--
our generation

00:26:36.565 --> 00:26:39.560 align:middle line:84%
is still uncomfortable
with that.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it
plays into the system.

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:45.084 align:middle line:84%
It plays into politics,
where everything is cloaked.

00:26:45.084 --> 00:26:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Everything is the
emperor's new clothes.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:47.333 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:47.333 --> 00:26:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: And our generation--
and previously more

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:54.120 align:middle line:84%
so-- is that we did not
want to question that.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.800 align:middle line:90%
We were hesitant to question it.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.600 align:middle line:84%
We had what we call
obedience to authority.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And we can refer to the great
Stanley Milgram experiment

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:06.950 align:middle line:84%
about how we follow authority
if someone wears a lab coat.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.520 align:middle line:84%
We see someone on television
wearing a white coat saying,

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.040 align:middle line:90%
this washing powder is the best.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.860 align:middle line:90%
We believe them.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:13.650 align:middle line:90%
The shift is--

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:15.740 align:middle line:84%
One of the major
shifts taking place

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:20.140 align:middle line:84%
is that automatic conditioning
is not going to apply.

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going
to come to a syndrome

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.180 align:middle line:84%
where the emperor
is really going

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.600 align:middle line:84%
to be seen for
having no clothes.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, we all are.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that what
we're all afraid of?

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.020 align:middle line:90%
That's the interesting thing.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.150 align:middle line:84%
The newer generation-- the kids
that are now in their teens,

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:36.510 align:middle line:84%
for example, even into their
'20s, and then of course

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:39.400 align:middle line:84%
younger-- don't seem
to have any fear

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.030 align:middle line:90%
of being seen for who they are.

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And they'll put their worst
behavior out there, even,

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.860 align:middle line:84%
where our generation
is still looking

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:50.680 align:middle line:84%
at not being seen for the flawed
humans that we actually are.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.710 align:middle line:84%
This is a huge
psychological shift,

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:57.870 align:middle line:84%
to move from hiding our
flaws to allowing ourselves

00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:00.045 align:middle line:90%
to be so publicly visible.

00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: Yeah.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's also a question
of digital identity.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.791 align:middle line:84%
It's something completely
new for many of us

00:28:06.791 --> 00:28:07.790 align:middle line:90%
in the older generation.

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:09.790 align:middle line:90%
What is digital identity?

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Because we've been living
in a physical world.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Now we're moving towards a
convergence of the inner world,

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:18.830 align:middle line:84%
the outer world, and a
technological world as well.

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And so we will need to
navigate all of that.

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:24.850 align:middle line:90%
And for us, it's difficult.

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:25.814 align:middle line:90%
We have that fear.

00:28:25.814 --> 00:28:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, the younger
generations, they

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:29.300 align:middle line:84%
don't have that fear,
because they sense it.

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.320 align:middle line:90%
They pick it up.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.820 align:middle line:84%
They pick it up
because they haven't

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.510 align:middle line:90%
known anything different.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:36.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, a major point is
that this generation

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:41.020 align:middle line:84%
will be the first generation
being born into a world where

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.754 align:middle line:84%
it's already set
up technologically

00:28:42.754 --> 00:28:44.420 align:middle line:84%
with the internet,
virtual technologies.

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:45.586 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The consciousness.

00:28:45.586 --> 00:28:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: Yeah.

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And so before-- previous
generations still

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:51.320 align:middle line:84%
had to learn
something, navigate it.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And so the energetic
environment,

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.090 align:middle line:84%
with the phoenix generation
we're moving into,

00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:59.800 align:middle line:84%
will seem organic
and natural to them.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.340 align:middle line:90%
And that's an important point.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.422 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And more non-linear.

00:29:03.422 --> 00:29:05.380 align:middle line:84%
That's another point you
bring up in your book.

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:08.505 align:middle line:84%
Their reality will be a
more nonlinear reality.

00:29:08.505 --> 00:29:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: And their
brain, for example, which

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:13.930 align:middle line:90%
is only just one small organ.

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:17.206 align:middle line:10%
The mind is the extended
mind, the whole body.

00:29:17.206 --> 00:29:18.080 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And beyond.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.160 align:middle line:10%
>>DENNIS: And beyond.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.259 align:middle line:84%
And that's another point
I think we should get to.

00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's do.

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:23.425 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: How the
internet really

00:29:23.425 --> 00:29:25.130 align:middle line:84%
is a reflection
of the inner mind.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:28.366 align:middle line:84%
So because their neurons
are firing differently,

00:29:28.366 --> 00:29:30.740 align:middle line:84%
their connectivity with this,
their understanding of time

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:32.935 align:middle line:84%
and space, it's
organic for them.

00:29:32.935 --> 00:29:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why we needed to
wait for generational change.

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:40.730 align:middle line:84%
That's why we go from
one day to the next.

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:43.880 align:middle line:84%
For example, the economic
crash came in September, 2008.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.830 align:middle line:90%
And everyone thought, that's it.

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:47.010 align:middle line:90%
This is the trigger.

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Tomorrow will be different.

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:50.260 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Even if it changes over the next
15 years, Regina, toward 2030,

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:56.360 align:middle line:84%
in terms of
evolutionary time span,

00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:00.270 align:middle line:84%
that is still an incredibly
short amount of time.

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:01.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's
ever been such

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.360 align:middle line:90%
a short time of radical change.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And so we're having a
convergence now, which

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:11.720 align:middle line:84%
we can call a tipping point,
to use that terminology-- where

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:15.240 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing the convergence
of that understanding of how

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.300 align:middle line:84%
to connect the inner world
with the outer world,

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.460 align:middle line:84%
with technology, with
a consciousness which

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.480 align:middle line:90%
is naturalized to that.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one of the ways
in which we used to-- speaking

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.440 align:middle line:84%
of linear, the way
history is played out

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.800 align:middle line:90%
will look completely different.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Because as your
write in the book,

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.890 align:middle line:84%
military activity has
been the milestone

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:41.390 align:middle line:84%
of our historical timeline,
globally, for a very long time.

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
that-- how time

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.410 align:middle line:84%
starts changing when
you're no longer keeping

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:49.566 align:middle line:84%
your clock by military
confrontations.

00:30:49.566 --> 00:30:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: And that
time of time scales

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.220 align:middle line:84%
is very territorial,
military territorial,

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.776 align:middle line:90%
moving forward over the map.

00:30:57.776 --> 00:30:59.794 align:middle line:90%
But the map is changing.

00:30:59.794 --> 00:31:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned
earlier, the end of empires

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:06.045 align:middle line:84%
is over, because there's so the
global players out there now.

00:31:06.045 --> 00:31:08.380 align:middle line:90%
And we're so interdependent.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
key-- a key phase,

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:13.750 align:middle line:84%
that we need that
interdependency

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:18.180 align:middle line:84%
to go beyond this
compartmentalization, the time

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:20.960 align:middle line:90%
frame of militarization.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Because then it's-- we have a
totally different perspective.

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:25.920 align:middle line:84%
We're not looking at
time and territory.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.260 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at connectivity
and collaboration.

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
completely different way

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.190 align:middle line:90%
to look at our timeline.

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And so you say the
extension of this

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.520 align:middle line:84%
is that time may be
viewed, in the future,

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:41.030 align:middle line:84%
looking back, by changes in
our understanding of cosmology,

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:43.820 align:middle line:84%
philosophy, science,
art, and myths.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:47.550 align:middle line:84%
So there may be some great
breakthrough in cosmology

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:50.076 align:middle line:84%
that is the marker
in time, for example.

00:31:50.076 --> 00:31:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
these changes and what

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:54.222 align:middle line:84%
you expect to see with this
generation and forward.

00:31:54.222 --> 00:31:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: Well,
for example, I like

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.160 align:middle line:84%
to talk about how this
time of innovation, time

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.590 align:middle line:84%
of understanding has
exponentialized--

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:05.370 align:middle line:84%
is exponential because
of its connectivity.

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:08.070 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's put one example.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:11.530 align:middle line:84%
Is that, if we put a
question into a computer

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and say what's the
answer, the computer

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:15.280 align:middle line:84%
would take a long
time to find out.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, SETI program
came along and used

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:20.050 align:middle line:84%
people's individual
computers in their home

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:22.070 align:middle line:90%
to share the research.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.370 align:middle line:90%
That's distributed intelligence.

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's now playing
out in the individual minds

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.550 align:middle line:90%
of humanity, the same model.

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:32.100 align:middle line:84%
Is that, rather than one
person coming up-- like Tesla,

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.990 align:middle line:84%
for example-- and
saying, I have an idea,

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:38.020 align:middle line:84%
now we're moving into
a time where there's

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.730 align:middle line:84%
going to be many Teslas of
the world, many people tapping

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:42.940 align:middle line:90%
into the consciousness of ideas.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Because if consciousness is not
inside the head, it's outside.

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:49.529 align:middle line:84%
So when you one Tesla standing
up and saying, I have an idea,

00:32:49.529 --> 00:32:50.820 align:middle line:90%
the power structure goes, boom.

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.550 align:middle line:90%
I've got you.

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:54.890 align:middle line:84%
How do you expand
upon that idea?

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:57.120 align:middle line:84%
How do you have great
change from this?

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and until now,
when the Teslas have emerged,

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.750 align:middle line:84%
they've been taken
down, systematically

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:05.270 align:middle line:84%
destroyed because whatever
it is they had to offer

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:08.700 align:middle line:84%
was not in alignment with the
either military, industrial,

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:09.785 align:middle line:90%
or corporate environment.

00:33:09.785 --> 00:33:11.046 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: Sure.

00:33:11.046 --> 00:33:13.250 align:middle line:90%
And that model is changing.

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Because when people can
connect up between themselves,

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:20.055 align:middle line:84%
share their ideas, share their
like-minded vision-- now, what

00:33:20.055 --> 00:33:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I feel that we're
going to move towards

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.900 align:middle line:84%
is more of the young people
of the phoenix generation,

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.090 align:middle line:84%
because they're accessing
this intuitive intelligence,

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:31.030 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have access
to ideas and the consciousness

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:33.420 align:middle line:84%
field, where many
people would have

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:37.720 align:middle line:84%
similar revelations or different
understanding of cosmology,

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.780 align:middle line:84%
for example, or many different
fields, at a similar time.

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, when that filters back
into a connected global space,

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:50.240 align:middle line:84%
then you have that kind of--
that information cannot be held

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.160 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.745 align:middle line:84%
And that coming
out is really going

00:33:52.745 --> 00:33:55.850 align:middle line:90%
to create exponential change.

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:58.064 align:middle line:84%
Information is
going to be filtered

00:33:58.064 --> 00:33:59.276 align:middle line:90%
through their humanity.

00:33:59.276 --> 00:34:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And one of the parts of
your book I just loved

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:06.040 align:middle line:84%
is when you were giving
an example-- by way

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:09.100 align:middle line:84%
of an experiment, I
believe-- of collective mind,

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:11.250 align:middle line:84%
such as what you're
talking, about the power

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:13.090 align:middle line:90%
of collective mind.

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And it had to do with
the weighing of an ox.

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:18.876 align:middle line:84%
So tell us that story, because
I found it fascinating.

00:34:18.876 --> 00:34:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: And the interesting
thing of that story

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:25.199 align:middle line:84%
is that it came about because
the person was a scientist who

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:27.210 align:middle line:90%
wanted to disprove it.

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like, again,
the Trojan horse metaphor.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Is that someone wants to take
something to disprove it,

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:35.180 align:middle line:84%
but it ends up actually
on the contrary.

00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:36.954 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
and it's revealing

00:34:36.954 --> 00:34:38.620 align:middle line:84%
about our connectedness
with each other.

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:41.034 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about collective
intelligence and the ox,

00:34:41.034 --> 00:34:41.909 align:middle line:90%
the weight of the ox.

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:43.325 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: The
weight of the ox, it

00:34:43.325 --> 00:34:46.719 align:middle line:84%
goes back to the 19th century--
middle of the 19th century

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:50.420 align:middle line:84%
in a British marketplace,
whereby these country fairs,

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.889 align:middle line:90%
they have the ox.

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And in order to--
they raffle the ox.

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:56.929 align:middle line:84%
So what they do is
that they ask people

00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:58.834 align:middle line:90%
to guess the weight of the ox.

00:34:58.834 --> 00:35:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
one who guesses

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:02.450 align:middle line:84%
the weight or the
nearest wins the ox,

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:05.540 align:middle line:84%
a way of making money very
much similar to crowd funding

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:06.770 align:middle line:90%
today, in a sense.

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:07.745 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In a sense.

00:35:07.745 --> 00:35:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: But what
happened was that when

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:13.010 align:middle line:84%
this social
scientist-- actually,

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:16.120 align:middle line:84%
he wanted to disapprove
the power of democracy.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.260 align:middle line:84%
He was saying that
what happens when

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.710 align:middle line:84%
you ask people to
collectively give their ideas?

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:22.140 align:middle line:90%
You get chaos.

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, we
don't need democracy.

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:27.280 align:middle line:84%
We should have an
elite power structure,

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.820 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
only coherence.

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, what he did-- he took
all the lottery findings.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.279 align:middle line:84%
Because, rightly
so, nobody won it.

00:35:35.279 --> 00:35:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you
say lottery, these

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.980 align:middle line:84%
were the guesses, the
estimates of the weight.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: Like a raffle,
a lottery, guess.

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:43.870 align:middle line:84%
People would write the
figure and put it in.

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:46.300 align:middle line:84%
So when he took all
those lottery tickets

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.120 align:middle line:84%
and he added up
all the estimates,

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:53.040 align:middle line:84%
he found that when he took
the average, it was spot on.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.445 align:middle line:90%
That was the weight of the ox.

00:35:54.445 --> 00:35:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Isn't that amazing?

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.884 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: Now, of
course, a scientist

00:35:57.884 --> 00:36:00.300 align:middle line:84%
would say, well, empirically,
that doesn't prove anything.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.130 align:middle line:84%
It was just the
average you took.

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:05.130 align:middle line:84%
But of course, we're
not talking empiricism.

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:08.160 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the power
of collective intelligence

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.946 align:middle line:84%
to arrive at solutions
by coming together.

00:36:10.946 --> 00:36:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:13.650 align:middle line:84%
No, I thought that
was fascinating.

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And when you overlay that
collective intelligence,

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:19.170 align:middle line:84%
that transparency, that
interconnectedness globally,

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:21.670 align:middle line:84%
you're also saying
that this generation

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:26.290 align:middle line:84%
is going to be coming in
with a-- I don't know,

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:28.710 align:middle line:84%
maybe a sense-- maybe that
would be what it's called--

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:33.620 align:middle line:84%
of abundance rather than lack,
even though they're being born

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:37.150 align:middle line:84%
into a time which is certainly
being challenged economically.

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:39.670 align:middle line:84%
But that psychologically
they're going

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:43.270 align:middle line:84%
to be bringing in this
sense of abundance,

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't mean
money, per say.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what that means.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Because wow, what a
shift that would be.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:52.730 align:middle line:84%
All of the people in this
reality are on lack and fear

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:53.920 align:middle line:90%
as a basis.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: And that's
been part of the duality

00:36:56.050 --> 00:37:00.250 align:middle line:84%
that we're struggling with,
because abundance and scarcity

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:03.190 align:middle line:84%
has been the them
versus us divide.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:05.610 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful division
to control people.

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, if the collective
feels abundant by nature,

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:10.300 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about what
that abundant looks like.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: Now, resources
throughout human civilization

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:16.820 align:middle line:84%
have always been controlled,
because that gives power,

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.670 align:middle line:84%
so whether it's energy
or finances or just

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:21.200 align:middle line:90%
social mobility.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, when that's controlled,
when there's resources,

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:27.120 align:middle line:84%
then we have the scarcity model,
because the scarcity model

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.550 align:middle line:90%
is an artificial model.

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have resource
in this world.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:32.940 align:middle line:90%
We have enough food.

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.686 align:middle line:90%
We have energy.

00:37:34.686 --> 00:37:36.060 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about
the whole range

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.340 align:middle line:90%
of resources that are available.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:41.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's the models
that don't work.

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we're looking at
different models-- if we look,

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.040 align:middle line:84%
for example, crowd
funding, which we just

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:50.040 align:middle line:84%
mentioned, about how individuals
can seek input from each other,

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:54.500 align:middle line:84%
to even economically just pay
$1 or $2 to finance something.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.080 align:middle line:84%
Or where we have
distributed energy programs,

00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:00.680 align:middle line:84%
localized energy can
distribute energy

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.260 align:middle line:84%
from what is abundant
in that area.

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Because the centralized model
takes energy from one place

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.115 align:middle line:84%
and spends a lot
of-- wastes a lot

00:38:08.115 --> 00:38:11.370 align:middle line:84%
of energy to transport it to
another place, to control it.

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we have new models
coming in that will work on,

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:20.660 align:middle line:84%
for example, localized
economies, localized energies,

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:23.840 align:middle line:84%
technological collaboration,
just innovation

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.290 align:middle line:90%
is a great resource.

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Empowerment, even positivity
is an abundant model.

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, these have all been
scarce artificially.

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:37.880 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at models that
are coming in and taking

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:42.710 align:middle line:84%
the distributed collective
way forward, then in fact,

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:45.010 align:middle line:84%
we don't have the
scarcity model.

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:49.000 align:middle line:84%
It's just a case of
where do we use it from

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.890 align:middle line:90%
and how do we channel it?

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:52.270 align:middle line:90%
And who does it go to?

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:55.230 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, there isn't
really the scarcity model

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:57.020 align:middle line:90%
there at all.

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.570 align:middle line:84%
That's been, I think,
an artificial--

00:38:58.570 --> 00:38:59.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Artificially
constructed.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: Smoke screen.

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:02.855 align:middle line:84%
But we still need time
to break away from it.

00:39:02.855 --> 00:39:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But even when
you talk about-- I mean,

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:06.580 align:middle line:84%
an interface might be,
as you mentioned before,

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:07.660 align:middle line:90%
crowd funding.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.310 align:middle line:84%
With crowd funding,
we feel as though we

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:13.310 align:middle line:84%
are empowered in that we're
aligning with our own choices,

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:15.420 align:middle line:84%
rather than what we're
being led toward.

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's just the
beginning of being

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:19.760 align:middle line:84%
able to use a
couple dollars here,

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.400 align:middle line:84%
a couple dollars
there to support

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.150 align:middle line:90%
what we're in alignment with.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And they come into a world where
that is how they're living.

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:27.790 align:middle line:84%
In general, that's
how they're living.

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:29.950 align:middle line:84%
You were talking about--
the modern civilization

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:32.560 align:middle line:84%
we know now, in
contrast to that,

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.400 align:middle line:84%
has created an
infantile state of mind.

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.626 align:middle line:90%
What did you mean by that?

00:39:36.626 --> 00:39:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: What I
meant by that, Regina,

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:43.450 align:middle line:84%
is that we've been conditioned
to have a form of dependency

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:46.270 align:middle line:90%
and to have the fear of freedom.

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, it sounds contradictory,
but one of the greatest fears

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.910 align:middle line:84%
that we've been dealing
with is freedom,

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:57.470 align:middle line:84%
because we've grown up within
a control mechanism, a control

00:39:57.470 --> 00:40:00.800 align:middle line:84%
matrix, where dependency
is at the forefront.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:05.065 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether it's-- because
the exploitation there is

00:40:05.065 --> 00:40:08.120 align:middle line:84%
because, biologically, when
the human being is born,

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.480 align:middle line:84%
it's dependent upon the
mother or the guardian.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, the human being
actually, as a social animal,

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.780 align:middle line:84%
requires a greater
length of dependency

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.160 align:middle line:90%
than most other animals.

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Most other animals, they
have an instinct which

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:24.080 align:middle line:84%
they can be independent in a
very short time-- human beings,

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:24.830 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:27.740 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons
is that a human being

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:35.300 align:middle line:84%
is born with less time to
develop, because of the way

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.692 align:middle line:84%
it's given birth,
the birth canal.

00:40:37.692 --> 00:40:39.150 align:middle line:84%
So the brain isn't
fully developed.

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:41.540 align:middle line:84%
The nervous system
isn't fully developed.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.040 align:middle line:84%
So the brain of a young
child and the nervous system

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.830 align:middle line:84%
of a young child
completes its development

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:48.640 align:middle line:90%
in social atmosphere.

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:51.300 align:middle line:84%
So that dependency's
is the first stage.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:56.570 align:middle line:84%
When that is then taken to
further degrees deliberately

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:58.650 align:middle line:84%
and, for example,
have dependency

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:04.220 align:middle line:84%
on maybe our peers, our
teachers, anyone in a uniform.

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, the economic system
has developed that,

00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:08.035 align:middle line:90%
that we have dependency.

00:41:08.035 --> 00:41:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, take
it all the way

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:11.760 align:middle line:84%
through to your last
breath, that you

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:17.050 align:middle line:84%
work for-- starting at age 23
toward a pension of dependency

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:18.700 align:middle line:90%
on a system.

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:20.352 align:middle line:90%
Soul killing.

00:41:20.352 --> 00:41:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: If we say
to people, well,

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:24.060 align:middle line:84%
if you want to change
your priorities,

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.680 align:middle line:90%
change your life patterns.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:26.890 align:middle line:90%
Change your country.

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And people will say,
well, wonderful advice.

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:31.660 align:middle line:90%
But I have a mortgage.

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:33.950 align:middle line:90%
I have a debt with the bank.

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:36.310 align:middle line:84%
I can't move away
from my job because I

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:39.290 align:middle line:84%
have to pay my credit
every month or my mortgage.

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
our generation.

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:44.542 align:middle line:84%
That's not going to be
their generation, per se.

00:41:44.542 --> 00:41:46.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: I think they're
not going to buy into that.

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.388 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: Because they're
going to see it a mile off.

00:41:49.388 --> 00:41:50.105 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yay.

00:41:50.105 --> 00:41:51.896 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: Because the
worst thing we can do

00:41:51.896 --> 00:41:54.379 align:middle line:84%
is give away our power, give
away our inner authority.

00:41:54.379 --> 00:41:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
you say about that

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.270 align:middle line:84%
is, when you're caught
in the old dynamic

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:02.820 align:middle line:84%
that we are in, which is that
lack and fear based culture--

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:06.840 align:middle line:84%
globally, pretty much--
it creates responses that

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:11.740 align:middle line:84%
are extreme in nature, a
need for extreme feeling,

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:15.320 align:middle line:84%
for violent sports,
and so forth.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:19.480 align:middle line:84%
You're saying that, again,
is what that generation will

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.240 align:middle line:90%
be moving away from.

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: Yes.

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:24.827 align:middle line:84%
I mean, violent sports, for
example, a sense of extreme.

00:42:24.827 --> 00:42:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Part of
the repression, yes.

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: That extreme
release is a human need

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:36.350 align:middle line:84%
as a counterbalance to
this internal constriction.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, for example, we hear
stories of, for example,

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:42.260 align:middle line:90%
rock stars.

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.410 align:middle line:90%
They go into hotels.

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:44.880 align:middle line:90%
They smash TVs.

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:48.350 align:middle line:84%
They think, oh, this
extremism, society loves it.

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And young people think, this is
a wonderful sense of freedom.

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:53.550 align:middle line:84%
What they don't
realize is that they

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:55.250 align:middle line:90%
do that to sell more records.

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:57.680 align:middle line:84%
It's encouraged by
the record industry.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.070 align:middle line:90%
It's all playing the game.

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, speaking
of playing the game,

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:05.020 align:middle line:84%
a couple days ago, we were
walking down the street

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:06.010 align:middle line:90%
here in Chelsea.

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And Chelsea had
just won a football,

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:10.010 align:middle line:90%
or soccer match in our parlance.

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my god, it's
frightening being there.

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:16.610 align:middle line:84%
People had their flip
cams and their cell phones

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:19.820 align:middle line:84%
taping each other, because
they were fighting and brawling

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:20.490 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Because-- I don't
understand it, of course.

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.680 align:middle line:90%
And I used to be a sportscaster.

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.210 align:middle line:84%
But I don't understand the
mania and what's swept up

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and what people are endowing
that sport with by way

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:33.425 align:middle line:84%
of their emotions and their
commitment and their passion

00:43:33.425 --> 00:43:36.170 align:middle line:84%
into something
really so irrelevant.

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:38.572 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: For them, it's--
I can't talk for all these

00:43:38.572 --> 00:43:40.530 align:middle line:84%
people, because everyone
has a different reason

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:41.820 align:middle line:90%
for their connection to it.

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.650 align:middle line:90%
It's a form of social identity.

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:45.844 align:middle line:84%
It's a need for
attachment to something.

00:43:45.844 --> 00:43:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And if we can't attach with
something which gives us

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:51.450 align:middle line:84%
fulfillment, then we
look for something.

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very powerful
release mechanism.

00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, the working week
is another example.

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Why do we-- most of us
have the weekend off.

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Why are such drugs as
alcohol socially acceptable?

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:07.130 align:middle line:84%
It's because we go
out on the weekend.

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:08.995 align:middle line:90%
We have complete blow out.

00:44:08.995 --> 00:44:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Go to
your football match,

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:14.400 align:middle line:84%
then have a blow out or
the two at the same time.

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: Come back to work
Monday morning feeling happy,

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:18.440 align:middle line:90%
because you felt like you've--

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:19.856 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've
gotten to release

00:44:19.856 --> 00:44:21.530 align:middle line:84%
all of that anxiety,
stress, and so

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:23.370 align:middle line:90%
forth for a short bit of time.

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:25.210 align:middle line:84%
So with a generation
that's coming

00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:28.885 align:middle line:84%
in more connected and more
holistic in their thought,

00:44:28.885 --> 00:44:31.190 align:middle line:84%
this should-- we
should see a dying down

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:32.920 align:middle line:84%
of this kind of
attachment as well?

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: Well, I feel
it'll be more organic,

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:39.080 align:middle line:84%
because they'll-- the
new generation will look

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.590 align:middle line:84%
in different areas
for nourishment.

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And also, because
they're connecting

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:48.740 align:middle line:84%
with an instinctual
intelligence, then they'll be--

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:51.350 align:middle line:90%
they'll feel less of the lack.

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, we need nourishment, but
how do we find nourishment?

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of the
extremism is-- comes

00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:02.260 align:middle line:84%
from a lack of self worth,
which is also encouraged

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:05.030 align:middle line:84%
by society to
increase dependency.

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No wonder we're
trying to hide what we feel

00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:09.535 align:middle line:84%
or the shameful aspects
of self, really.

00:45:09.535 --> 00:45:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: Transparency.

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:11.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:12.900 align:middle line:90%
We're afraid of transparency.

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.960 align:middle line:84%
We're made to feel
ashamed of ourselves.

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: And if we
feel good in ourselves,

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.580 align:middle line:90%
transparency isn't an issue.

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Another word for transparency
is sharing, collaboration.

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And we've been conditioned
not to collaborate.

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:29.894 align:middle line:84%
An example is, when I was
at school and make yourself,

00:45:29.894 --> 00:45:31.810 align:middle line:84%
if we wanted to collaborate
with our neighbor,

00:45:31.810 --> 00:45:32.893 align:middle line:90%
you got your hand slapped.

00:45:32.893 --> 00:45:34.000 align:middle line:90%
It was called cheating.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.539 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly, except
in the Waldorf School.

00:45:36.539 --> 00:45:38.330 align:middle line:84%
I remember, the one
thing I loved about it.

00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:40.040 align:middle line:84%
My son was in the
Waldorf system.

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
only system I notice

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:44.140 align:middle line:84%
where they did this, where
the teacher would say,

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:46.050 align:middle line:84%
please, you're going to
have a test tomorrow.

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:47.090 align:middle line:90%
Share with each other.

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:48.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm leaving the room.

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And he encouraged them to
all share their information.

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.150 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's best for
all of you if you do that.

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, that's
the wave of the future.

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: Indeed.

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And they were spot on
with that, and earlier.

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
creating-- he was trying

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:06.210 align:middle line:84%
to discourage the need for
competition within the group.

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And now, so how does
competition factor

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.585 align:middle line:90%
into this new generation?

00:46:09.585 --> 00:46:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: Well, as
I've talked about,

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.010 align:middle line:84%
we're moving toward
different value systems.

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I call them C values,
because in English language,

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:19.430 align:middle line:90%
these words are C words.

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:23.490 align:middle line:84%
They're competition,
conflict, control.

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And I say that the
new values which

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:27.550 align:middle line:84%
will be taken on board
by the new generations

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:31.250 align:middle line:84%
will be collaboration,
compassion, communication,

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:32.980 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And so competition,
it keeps us fighting

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:38.350 align:middle line:84%
against the Joneses or
the people next door.

00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Because it wants--
we feel that we

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.142 align:middle line:84%
want to get to the
top of the ladder.

00:46:44.142 --> 00:46:46.650 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
expected of us.

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And to get there, we have
to push everyone away.

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And then that's the
control mechanism

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:56.390 align:middle line:84%
which helps society to
continue to engineer itself

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:59.780 align:middle line:84%
and to keep the top players
there and the masses

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.260 align:middle line:90%
without access.

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's another key
word, Regina, is access.

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:08.970 align:middle line:84%
We're moving into the age of
access-- open source software,

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:13.160 align:middle line:84%
access to information, access
to other minds and other hearts.

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:15.496 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's another
exponential energy.

00:47:15.496 --> 00:47:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How does that
not become hijacked?

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Just as the
spiritual and new age

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:23.620 align:middle line:84%
movements of expanded
awareness and consciousness

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:26.940 align:middle line:84%
were hijacked into even
something like 2012,

00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:29.660 align:middle line:84%
how is the emergence of
their new consciousness

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:32.259 align:middle line:84%
not going to be hijacked
again and turned

00:47:32.259 --> 00:47:33.550 align:middle line:90%
into something it shouldn't be?

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: Well, I'm
not saying it won't.

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:38.540 align:middle line:84%
I feel that there'll
be attempts to do that.

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:42.910 align:middle line:84%
What's changing is our, or
humanity's, response to that

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:44.720 align:middle line:90%
and recognition of it.

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, before, we
were-- many of us

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:50.680 align:middle line:84%
were saying, what is
the real information.

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:56.152 align:middle line:84%
We don't have-- we may not
have a fully developed detector

00:47:56.152 --> 00:47:58.730 align:middle line:84%
in-built with us to be able
to distinguish what's true

00:47:58.730 --> 00:47:59.880 align:middle line:90%
and what is false.

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.910 align:middle line:90%
And that was our work.

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're going to
have an inherent software that

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:05.175 align:middle line:90%
detects the difference.

00:48:05.175 --> 00:48:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: More so.

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:07.858 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: Now, our
generation perhaps had

00:48:07.858 --> 00:48:10.320 align:middle line:84%
to do more work on
themselves, to be

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.660 align:middle line:90%
able to have a feeling, a sense.

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And so when there's an increased
instinctual intelligence,

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:19.610 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to
acquired information,

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:23.055 align:middle line:84%
then that recognition
will be more immediate.

00:48:23.055 --> 00:48:25.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you say
this is essentially

00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:29.670 align:middle line:84%
the rise of inner authority,
rather than external authority.

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:33.270 align:middle line:84%
This will be-- we're the
bridging generation, or then

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:35.790 align:middle line:84%
ones younger than us are
the bridging generation

00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:38.790 align:middle line:84%
to the move toward
inner authority, which

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:39.950 align:middle line:90%
changes the whole game.

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: And this is a natural
endowment of the human being.

00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:49.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we've always had
it, but it's been stifled,

00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:54.240 align:middle line:84%
and it's been
basically denied us

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.330 align:middle line:84%
through-- we talk
about conditioning

00:48:56.330 --> 00:48:58.280 align:middle line:90%
and the age of dependency.

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And even now, we're
dependent on everything,

00:49:00.350 --> 00:49:03.460 align:middle line:84%
whether it's food
sourcing, security,

00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:07.450 align:middle line:84%
a roof over our head--
the basic needs of Maslow.

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And as Abraham Maslow said, if
we can't cover our basic needs,

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:13.450 align:middle line:84%
we cannot work toward
self-actualization.

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:16.214 align:middle line:84%
To work on ourselves
is a luxury.

00:49:16.214 --> 00:49:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For most
people, because we're

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.230 align:middle line:90%
exhausted at the end of the day.

00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:19.935 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: Of course, yeah.

00:49:19.935 --> 00:49:21.684 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, working
a couple jobs just

00:49:21.684 --> 00:49:23.070 align:middle line:90%
to keep roof over head.

00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:27.030 align:middle line:84%
So along with this comes the
emergence, or reemergence,

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:31.260 align:middle line:84%
of respect and embracing
of the feminine aspect

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:32.110 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And you say that the internet
embraces the feminine.

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:39.730 align:middle line:84%
It reflects feminine
aspect of consciousness.

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:41.172 align:middle line:90%
How so?

00:49:41.172 --> 00:49:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: Because
it's multi-relational.

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I talk about
feminine consciousness,

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:49.619 align:middle line:84%
again, we do suffer
from vocabulary.

00:49:49.619 --> 00:49:52.160 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not trying to create a
divide between male and female.

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, no,
it's more yin-yang.

00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:54.010 align:middle line:90%
I get that.

00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:56.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: There are aspects
of each, which we will have,

00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.310 align:middle line:84%
but which maybe are
manifested more by others.

00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, the female consciousness
is one of, let's say,

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:12.120 align:middle line:84%
multi-relational tasking, the
ability to connect, to share,

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:13.420 align:middle line:90%
and collaborate.

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:15.240 align:middle line:90%
And it's non-linear.

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, a male consciousness may be
more goal orientated and fixed

00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:23.550 align:middle line:84%
on completing a task
rather than moving

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:25.656 align:middle line:90%
through several processes.

00:50:25.656 --> 00:50:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, processional
consciousness may

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:30.925 align:middle line:90%
be more of the feminine energy.

00:50:30.925 --> 00:50:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, the internet
works that way.

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And we can say it's
quite circular.

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, one example
which I've referred to

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:44.040 align:middle line:84%
is that if we look in
history, an institution which

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:47.160 align:middle line:84%
has a very strong male
consciousness manifestation

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.990 align:middle line:90%
has been orthodox religion.

00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've had the priest at
the top, not allowing access

00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:57.467 align:middle line:90%
to any information, controlled.

00:50:57.467 --> 00:50:58.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Vertical access.

00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: Vertical, yeah.

00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:02.450 align:middle line:90%
And now we had the Inquisition.

00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:04.020 align:middle line:90%
We had the witch hunts.

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:08.660 align:middle line:84%
We had the-- many of the
female population stigmatized

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:09.890 align:middle line:90%
for being witches.

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:11.290 align:middle line:90%
And how did they gather?

00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:12.550 align:middle line:90%
They gathered in circles.

00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have this imagery
of the vertical controlled

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:19.570 align:middle line:84%
and this feminine coming
together in circles, gathering.

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing more than
putting the fear into authority

00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:23.970 align:middle line:90%
than people gathering.

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And you even call that
feminine yin energy

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:30.830 align:middle line:84%
having a magical
presence to it, which

00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:32.810 align:middle line:84%
is what created the
repression of it

00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:35.350 align:middle line:84%
within these old patriarchal
systems to begin with.

00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: It's
something very sacred.

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:39.925 align:middle line:84%
Gathering, sharing,
coming together

00:51:39.925 --> 00:51:41.450 align:middle line:90%
is something very sacred.

00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:46.060 align:middle line:84%
So when we have such things
as the Burning Man event,

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:48.340 align:middle line:84%
or even now, the rise
of music festivals--

00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:51.610 align:middle line:84%
in England, Glastonbury
is the major example.

00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can say
it's very tribal,

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:55.970 align:middle line:84%
but there's an energy
there which we share,

00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:59.400 align:middle line:84%
which is a collective
field energy, which

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:01.270 align:middle line:90%
has always been there.

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:03.910 align:middle line:84%
But people feel energy--
energized by that.

00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:07.004 align:middle line:84%
And many people feel
that's so natural.

00:52:07.004 --> 00:52:08.295 align:middle line:90%
That's our natural inheritance.

00:52:08.295 --> 00:52:09.770 align:middle line:90%
We feel inspired by it.

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:11.860 align:middle line:90%
It's something very sacred.

00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:15.080 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we could
go as far as to say

00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:19.685 align:middle line:84%
that these gatherings are a
new shamanizing of humanity.

00:52:19.685 --> 00:52:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And so that will be
more common expression

00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:27.170 align:middle line:84%
of the generation that's rising,
of course, the need to gather.

00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about,
from these young kids

00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:33.710 align:middle line:84%
and the ones just prior to
them, the emerging genius

00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:35.210 align:middle line:84%
that you talk
about in your book.

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And we can even talk about--
use Steven Gonzales Jr.

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:42.210 align:middle line:84%
as an example this kind
of shocking genius.

00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:43.940 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
precocious at one time.

00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:46.148 align:middle line:84%
Now I see that this is just
the way it's going to be,

00:52:46.148 --> 00:52:47.082 align:middle line:90%
and it's lovely.

00:52:47.082 --> 00:52:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: And we're seeing
instances popping up

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:53.470 align:middle line:84%
with new YouTube videos all
around the net of young people

00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:56.389 align:middle line:84%
coming forward, giving
speeches at 12 years old.

00:52:56.389 --> 00:52:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Shockingly brilliant.

00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: 11 years old-- and
they understand the system.

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:03.730 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, well,
what is going on?

00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the past, we may
have called them prodigies.

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps many prodigies
were an earlier wave of this.

00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think we're going to
come a time where we may just

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:15.630 align:middle line:84%
scrap the word genius because
there are too many of them.

00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:18.200 align:middle line:84%
You can't have a world
of geniuses all over.

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:24.510 align:middle line:84%
So another phrase that I use is
that this is not the new age;

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:25.390 align:middle line:90%
it's the new normal.

00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: And for
me, that's critical.

00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Is to normalize
what we're moving

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:33.250 align:middle line:84%
into so the young
children don't feel

00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:35.120 align:middle line:84%
that they're something
really different.

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:36.192 align:middle line:90%
They're not weird.

00:53:36.192 --> 00:53:37.400 align:middle line:90%
We shouldn't stigmatize them.

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.160 align:middle line:90%
They are the new normal.

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:41.915 align:middle line:84%
And the new normal are
these young children

00:53:41.915 --> 00:53:44.160 align:middle line:90%
who, for us, seem like geniuses.

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:46.460 align:middle line:84%
For example, I talk
about in the book

00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:51.070 align:middle line:84%
young children writing
applications for programs

00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:56.010 align:middle line:84%
that help people to want
anti-illness, anti-bullying.

00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:57.930 --> 00:53:58.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: Go ahead.

00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, you go ahead,
more examples, please.

00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: Well, the young
children who wrote an app

00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:06.020 align:middle line:84%
for young children at
school to connect with it,

00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:10.306 align:middle line:84%
to talk about their bullying
experiences and to gain help;

00:54:10.306 --> 00:54:13.360 align:middle line:84%
and a young boy-- I
forget his name now--

00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:16.020 align:middle line:84%
who suffered from
illness-- I think cancer--

00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:17.540 align:middle line:90%
wrote an app to actually--

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I think that
was Steven Gonzales, yes.

00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: Now, their
age-- in one instance,

00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:26.960 align:middle line:84%
another young girl wrote an
app for a school project.

00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And the school didn't
believe or couldn't

00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:31.190 align:middle line:84%
believe that she
actually wrote it.

00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So they actually asked her to
write it again with monitors,

00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:38.730 align:middle line:84%
to see that she had the
capacity to write it.

00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:41.540 align:middle line:84%
We don't have that faith,
unless we can see it.

00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:43.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.480 align:middle line:90%
I find that fascinating.

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that,
if you go further into this,

00:54:48.670 --> 00:54:52.190 align:middle line:84%
and if you want to dive down to
this end of the pool-- and not

00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:53.684 align:middle line:90%
everybody's on board with this.

00:54:53.684 --> 00:54:55.600 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing
is, we look at that.

00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And then our
generation would almost

00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:03.100 align:middle line:84%
have an envy to be so free, to
be so brilliant and so open,

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:06.290 align:middle line:84%
to be connected, passionate,
have the heart open once again.

00:55:06.290 --> 00:55:08.920 align:middle line:84%
From that, shouldn't
we see a huge shift

00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:11.950 align:middle line:84%
in creativity,
levels of creativity?

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: Yes.

00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And also, a thing
to say, Regina,

00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:17.462 align:middle line:84%
is that it may not
be all smooth, easy.

00:55:17.462 --> 00:55:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I don't
think the transition is

00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:21.120 align:middle line:90%
going to be smooth at all.

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Like you say, and as I
said earlier, in nature,

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.510 align:middle line:90%
these things happen over time.

00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's always that
rough spot in the transition.

00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:31.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's just assume we're going
through some rough spots ahead.

00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:32.490 align:middle line:90%
But let's go beyond that.

00:55:32.490 --> 00:55:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: And those
sandpaper moments,

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:37.950 align:middle line:84%
those rough spots are
the catalysts for change,

00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:39.740 align:middle line:90%
catalysts for creativity.

00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:41.230 align:middle line:90%
So we need them.

00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:42.860 align:middle line:90%
And creativity is infectious.

00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:45.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not only diseases
which are infectious.

00:55:45.790 --> 00:55:47.405 align:middle line:90%
Good things are infectious.

00:55:47.405 --> 00:55:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think creativity
is going to be

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:53.510 align:middle line:84%
one of the new
infections that are

00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:55.400 align:middle line:84%
going to enter
the global sphere.

00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And so for example, if a
young child or even a parent

00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:01.450 align:middle line:84%
looks at these
examples on YouTube

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:03.270 align:middle line:84%
of another young
child doing this,

00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:05.650 align:middle line:84%
then the parent will say,
well, maybe to their child--

00:56:05.650 --> 00:56:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's
possible, obviously.

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: What do
you want to do?

00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:10.450 align:middle line:90%
How can I help you?

00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And the young child will
say, I may need this.

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.300 align:middle line:90%
I may need that.

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And the parent will say,
well, I'll help you, if I can.

00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:20.600 align:middle line:84%
So in the past, maybe the
parent would say to the child,

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:23.250 align:middle line:84%
do you want to play
a musical instrument?

00:56:23.250 --> 00:56:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And that was the kind of one
of the aspects of creativity,

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.230 align:middle line:90%
playing a musical instrument.

00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:30.070 align:middle line:84%
But that's going to
be a whole playing

00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:31.130 align:middle line:90%
field of new creativity.

00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
going to create a need

00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:34.510 align:middle line:84%
for a completely different
way of education.

00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:36.160 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
your vision of that?

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:36.743 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: Yes.

00:56:36.743 --> 00:56:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, education
is going to be one

00:56:39.690 --> 00:56:42.100 align:middle line:84%
of the areas of
significant change.

00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
be a game changer.

00:56:44.850 --> 00:56:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing that
now with, for example,

00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:50.920 align:middle line:84%
such institutions as Khan
Academy on the internet,

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:56.110 align:middle line:84%
where information is being
made available for anyone

00:56:56.110 --> 00:56:58.750 align:middle line:84%
to come into contact
with it and to use that.

00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:00.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a peer to
peer educational--

00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You think
the school room

00:57:01.550 --> 00:57:02.580 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a
thing of the past?

00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: Yeah, I
mean, the classroom.

00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:04.373 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Has to be.

00:57:04.373 --> 00:57:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: The four
walls is a prison.

00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And the school
curriculum is a prison,

00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:18.540 align:middle line:84%
because that ideal of
learning in isolation,

00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:20.530 align:middle line:84%
but not-- I don't think
it's called learning.

00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:23.510 align:middle line:84%
I think it's called
memorization.

00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's a consequence of the
Industrial Revolution, the work

00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:31.550 align:middle line:84%
houses, were just to educate
the young children enough

00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:33.560 align:middle line:90%
to put them in the workforce.

00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, those four
walls, I think, are

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:41.090 align:middle line:84%
going to slowly dissolve,
because the first wave is

00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:42.930 align:middle line:84%
computers coming
into the classroom.

00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Students now are reaching
to other students

00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:48.734 align:middle line:84%
in other countries, other
classrooms, to share projects.

00:57:48.734 --> 00:57:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's
going to be a shift.

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:53.250 align:middle line:84%
The first wave is that
students will then also

00:57:53.250 --> 00:57:56.300 align:middle line:84%
start to ask other students to
mark through their own work.

00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:59.100 align:middle line:84%
It won't even be called
marking, feedback.

00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And how do they evaluate
their own work together?

00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:03.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
a teacher saying,

00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:07.740 align:middle line:90%
this is X marks or anything.

00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:09.925 align:middle line:84%
So they'll be collaborating
between themselves.

00:58:09.925 --> 00:58:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And all
different age grades.

00:58:11.550 --> 00:58:16.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's all going to be a
matter of what your ability is,

00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:18.251 align:middle line:84%
regardless of if you're
11 or 18 years old.

00:58:18.251 --> 00:58:20.500 align:middle line:84%
There's a model school in
Russia doing that right now.

00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And the genius levels-- I mean,
we'll still say genius for now.

00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:24.840 align:middle line:90%
Really, it's amazing.

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: And young people can
mentor other young children.

00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:29.960 align:middle line:84%
You won't have to
give your authority

00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:31.410 align:middle line:90%
to one teacher in the classroom.

00:58:31.410 --> 00:58:31.951 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:58:31.951 --> 00:58:34.020 align:middle line:84%
I like this vision of
the future in education.

00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:35.020 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:38.264 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, people
will say, oh, my god.

00:58:38.264 --> 00:58:39.930 align:middle line:84%
They're going to shut
down the internet.

00:58:39.930 --> 00:58:41.554 align:middle line:84%
And I always say,
don't worry about it.

00:58:41.554 --> 00:58:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Some 12-year-old
will write code.

00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:45.320 align:middle line:84%
It'll be back up
again by morning,

00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:47.170 align:middle line:90%
which is turning out to be true.

00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And also, if you want to
get super esoteric about it,

00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:51.530 align:middle line:84%
if we look at a circle
of life, for those

00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:53.960 align:middle line:84%
who buy into the notion
of reincarnation,

00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:56.320 align:middle line:84%
those beings are just
setting us up for ourselves

00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:58.330 align:middle line:90%
later on perhaps.

00:58:58.330 --> 00:59:00.152 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: We're
nurturing ourselves.

00:59:00.152 --> 00:59:01.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
nurturing ourselves

00:59:01.610 --> 00:59:04.510 align:middle line:84%
in our future generation
and iteration of ourselves.

00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:05.440 align:middle line:90%
We just have a minute.

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:06.470 align:middle line:90%
Any final comments?

00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DENNIS: I'd like to say that
one of the emphases that I try

00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:13.000 align:middle line:84%
to put out there is that we
have all the resources we need.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.820 align:middle line:90%
We have all the tools.

00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And those tools are
mostly within us.

00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:20.770 align:middle line:84%
It's about empowering
ourselves for us

00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:22.020 align:middle line:90%
to make a change in the world.

00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:25.400 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to
make a global event.

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:27.570 align:middle line:90%
We can make individual gestures.

00:59:27.570 --> 00:59:30.260 align:middle line:10%
And I think my
feeling, my sense,

00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:32.190 align:middle line:10%
is that the world
is going to change

00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:36.620 align:middle line:10%
through thousands and then
millions of individual gestures

00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:39.510 align:middle line:10%
coming into the global playing
field, the global planetary

00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:41.180 align:middle line:10%
mind, planetary heart.

00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:42.970 align:middle line:10%
So don't be disheartened.

00:59:42.970 --> 00:59:44.710 align:middle line:10%
Don't feel, what can I do.

00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Every gesture, every
intention, every heart energy,

00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:52.640 align:middle line:84%
every word spoken is
all part of the future

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.430 align:middle line:90%
of the energetic connectivity.

00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:57.616 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining us here.

00:59:57.616 --> 00:59:58.532 align:middle line:90%
>>DENNIS: My pleasure.

00:59:58.532 --> 01:00:00.842 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Regina.

01:00:00.842 --> 01:00:02.950 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, the
name of Kingsley's book

01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:04.760 align:middle line:10%
is "The Phoenix
Generation," which

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:07.860 align:middle line:10%
is a beautiful vision for
our future and for ourselves.

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:11.480 align:middle line:90%
on Gaiam TV in London.
