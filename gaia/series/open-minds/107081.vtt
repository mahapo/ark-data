00:00:09.424 --> 00:00:27.649 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:29.940 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Throughout
the history of the world,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.080 align:middle line:10%
adepts have attempted to find
the seat of the human soul.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.460 align:middle line:84%
One key symbol, if
we go back far enough

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.900 align:middle line:84%
into Egyptology and perhaps
beyond, is the pine cone.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.430 align:middle line:84%
The pine cone represents
the pineal gland.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And what is the pineal
gland credited with?

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.600 align:middle line:84%
We're speaking with Rabbi Joel
Bakst today, a Jewish scholar,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.570 align:middle line:84%
regarding his belief
that the Torah is

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.310 align:middle line:84%
the gateway to
understanding the pineal

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.760 align:middle line:84%
and our connection
with divine source.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.600 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>>JOEL BAKST: Thank you, Regina.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.736 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This
will be interesting

00:00:57.736 --> 00:01:00.250 align:middle line:84%
because we really haven't done
any shows on the Kabbalah.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And so you're going
to be explaining

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.650 align:middle line:84%
some things most of
us have not been--

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.340 align:middle line:84%
unless you're a Jewish scholar--
have been exposed to before.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.825 align:middle line:84%
So this is going
to be fun for us.

00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: Yes, I
expect there will

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.000 align:middle line:90%
be lots of aha experiences.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you found
what you consider

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.970 align:middle line:84%
to be the key to consciousness
within your studies

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.790 align:middle line:84%
throughout your lifetime
and the consciousness

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.980 align:middle line:84%
and the communication
pathways with God.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain that just
a little bit, just kind of

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.120 align:middle line:84%
set up the context for the
rest of the conversation?

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.440 align:middle line:10%
>>BAKST: I began my
spiritual journey

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.900 align:middle line:10%
when I was around
17 or 18 years old.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.710 align:middle line:10%
I'm a total product of the
'60s from Southern California.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And I was exposed to everything
that was going on back then,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.000 align:middle line:84%
from psychedelics to Eastern
influence, yoga, Kundalini.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.910 align:middle line:90%
And it woke up my soul.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.250 align:middle line:84%
I then went to visit the
land of Israel ostensibly

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.220 align:middle line:84%
to study the Kabbalah,
not really even knowing

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.190 align:middle line:90%
what it was at the time.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And forgetting one
little technicality,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.310 align:middle line:84%
and that is that back
then hardly anything

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.979 align:middle line:84%
was available in
English, and I was not

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.000 align:middle line:90%
speaking Hebrew at the time.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And I then enrolled
in a yeshiva,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.300 align:middle line:84%
which is a rabbinical
seminary, and they did not

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.210 align:middle line:90%
offer Kabbalah.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.575 align:middle line:84%
They offered Talmud,
Halakhah, that's Jewish law,

00:02:29.575 --> 00:02:32.240 align:middle line:84%
and the Musar,
the Jewish ethics.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was told again
and again that you

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:84%
have to first build
your foundation

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.270 align:middle line:84%
with the traditional tools
of the Jewish religion

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.520 align:middle line:90%
before you begin the Kabbalah.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.853 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which was interesting.

00:02:46.853 --> 00:02:48.940 align:middle line:84%
You were atheist at
this point still, right?

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: I was an atheist
regarding any established

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:90%
religion.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.125 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: If I'm on
a spiritual search--

00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:56.975 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any kind of
the classic-- yeah.

00:02:56.975 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes, totally, totally.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, back earlier
in what amounted

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.970 align:middle line:84%
to like religious
Hebrew school, I

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.460 align:middle line:90%
was known as the class atheist.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.256 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:07.256 --> 00:03:08.380 align:middle line:90%
That's why I brought it up.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.810 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now you happened to
kind of dive into the deep end

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.177 align:middle line:90%
pretty quickly.

00:03:14.177 --> 00:03:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yeah.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.640 align:middle line:84%
So I spent a good 12 years,
day and night, six days a week.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.980 align:middle line:84%
There's no two-day
weekend in Israel.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And I mastered Hebrew
and Aramaic and Talmud

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.430 align:middle line:90%
and Jewish law, as I mentioned.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And then I slowly began to
study the Kabbalah with teachers

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.240 align:middle line:90%
and from books and colleagues.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And as I developed
those tools, it

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.900 align:middle line:84%
enabled me actually to go
in the direction consciously

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.710 align:middle line:84%
where I began-- when I woke
up at 17, 18 years old.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.709 align:middle line:84%
I actually found a
book of Hatha yoga

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle line:84%
that my mother had in
the house, and that's

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:90%
what started the whole thing.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like Jessie Stearn,
"Yoga, Life, and Reincarnation"

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:03.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes, yes.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know that got a
whole generation of people

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.370 align:middle line:90%
on the path.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.400 align:middle line:90%
It was a good guess.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: And so my studies
led me to a deep investigation

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.290 align:middle line:84%
for learning the
fundamentals of the Kabbalah.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.592 align:middle line:84%
And let me just explain
about the term "Kabbalah."

00:04:24.592 --> 00:04:28.540 align:middle line:84%
It means as much as the
word "science" means.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.740 align:middle line:84%
One man's science is
another man's witchcraft.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.790 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
fields of science.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, Kabbalah
is not a thing.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not one thing at all.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.460 align:middle line:90%
There are many different fields.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.170 align:middle line:84%
As many fields as there
are in modern science,

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.342 align:middle line:84%
believe it or not, there
are in the Kabbalah.

00:04:44.342 --> 00:04:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this
is my next question.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.430 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into definitions,
because for non-Jewish viewers,

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.700 align:middle line:84%
we don't have really much of an
idea what a lot of this means.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: Let me tell
you a little secret.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: For most
Jewish viewers also.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.775 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You don't either.

00:04:57.775 --> 00:04:58.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's interesting because
I think in the Western world,

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.640 align:middle line:84%
most non-Jews heard the word
"Kabbalah" or "Kabbalah"

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.320 align:middle line:84%
the first time
because of Madonna.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Exactly.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I mean, really.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: It's out.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.850 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Madonna
brought it forward.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: The cat
is out of the bag.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.170 align:middle line:90%
But the question is--

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What is it?

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.679 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: --what is the cat?

00:05:15.679 --> 00:05:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.720 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to do, if
you don't mind at this point,

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.657 align:middle line:84%
you can give us a little bit
of a religious lesson here--

00:05:21.657 --> 00:05:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Sure.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and leading
up to the Kabbalah.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is telling us the
difference between the Talmud,

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.257 align:middle line:84%
the Torah, and ultimately,
what is the Kabbalah?

00:05:31.257 --> 00:05:32.590 align:middle line:90%
You just explained a little bit.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.320 align:middle line:90%
It's like the word "science."

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.600 align:middle line:84%
But let's have some history
so we know what we're not

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.150 align:middle line:90%
talking about and what we are.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.422 align:middle line:84%
The word "Torah"
means "teachings."

00:05:44.422 --> 00:05:47.590 align:middle line:90%
It means education.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.270 align:middle line:90%
It means transmission.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And the Torah essentially
has three different meanings.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.150 align:middle line:84%
It's most specific
meaning, it refers

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.950 align:middle line:84%
to the Five Books of Moses known
as the Pentateuch-- Genesis

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.060 align:middle line:90%
through Deuteronomy.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's the main
meaning of the Torah.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Then, by extension, Torah also
refers to all the other books

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.464 align:middle line:84%
of what in the
Christian Western world

00:06:10.464 --> 00:06:11.630 align:middle line:90%
they call the Old Testament.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.338 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to ask.

00:06:13.338 --> 00:06:15.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: OK?

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And Judaism consists
of 24 books.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And they include the Prophets
and the other books like Psalms

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.370 align:middle line:84%
and Proverbs, the
Book of Daniel,

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.160 align:middle line:90%
and the Book of Chronicles.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's also
Torah, by extension--

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.009 align:middle line:84%
refers to all of those three
books, which together are 24.

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: Then, and
most importantly,

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.000 align:middle line:84%
the term "Torah," by
further extension,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.250 align:middle line:84%
refers to the very
vast oral tradition.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.640 align:middle line:84%
There's an oral Torah along
with the written Torah.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Now, why must this be so?

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at the Godhead.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.790 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's aware of
this concept that man

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.280 align:middle line:90%
is made in the image of God.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.120 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know now,
in the last 40 years,

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.970 align:middle line:84%
we really have two brains and
two hemispheres in our brain,

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.900 align:middle line:84%
and they process information
in two very different ways.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.360 align:middle line:84%
We have the left brain that's
essentially analytical, linear,

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.710 align:middle line:90%
binary.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the right brain
is unitive, circular.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.950 align:middle line:90%
Likewise--

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Credited with
being the more creative part.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.310 align:middle line:84%
But really, we would want to say
there's two modes of creativity

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:30.810 align:middle line:90%
in here.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:30.956 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:30.956 --> 00:07:32.748 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one certainly
influences the other.

00:07:32.748 --> 00:07:33.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Absolutely.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.806 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: And this is precisely
why there are two Torahs.

00:07:38.806 --> 00:07:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Two Torahs.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:39.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Two Torahs.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.060 align:middle line:90%
Who ever heard of that?

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the first
I ever heard of two Torahs.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:41.775 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: I know.

00:07:41.775 --> 00:07:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.090 align:middle line:90%
So what's the other Torah?

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: OK.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
the oral and there's

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.480 align:middle line:84%
the one that's kind of the
Old Testament and more.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:46.930 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yeah.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Then there's the oral.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.816 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: And that's called
the written and the oral.

00:07:49.816 --> 00:07:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Because we're made
in the image of God,

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:56.120 align:middle line:84%
which means when the Godhead,
as much as we can try to express

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.350 align:middle line:84%
that, which we cannot,
OK, iterates itself,

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:04.160 align:middle line:84%
makes copies of itself, it makes
the human being in its image.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.890 align:middle line:84%
We precisely have two modes
of information processing

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:14.740 align:middle line:84%
because the divine mind has
two modes of processing.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.150 align:middle line:90%
And we're just replicating that.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, Torah is considered
to be the mind of God,

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.770 align:middle line:90%
the thoughts of God.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.750 align:middle line:84%
If God, the Godhead,
has two hemispheres,

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:29.000 align:middle line:84%
two modes of processing,
therefore the Torah,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.020 align:middle line:84%
by definition, must
have two modes as well.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.380 align:middle line:84%
They are the written and
the oral, the written

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.059 align:middle line:84%
corresponding, in general,
to the left hemisphere.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:38.559 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.500 align:middle line:90%
As it processes, it's linear.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.340 align:middle line:84%
The written Torah is just the
letters that are written down,

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.921 align:middle line:84%
which are black ink
upon white parchment.

00:08:46.921 --> 00:08:47.420 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.620 align:middle line:84%
In the original
scroll of the Torah,

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.340 align:middle line:90%
there's no vowels written.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.360 align:middle line:84%
That's all part of
the oral Torah that's

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.530 align:middle line:90%
superimposed upon the written.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.640 align:middle line:84%
It's just like a binary
computer printout.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: The right
hemisphere is the oral Torah.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And the oral Torah, just like
with our two hemispheres,

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:11.960 align:middle line:90%
they work independent.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.490 align:middle line:84%
But there are united
via the corpus callosum,

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.390 align:middle line:84%
a network of several
hundred nerves, wires,

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.000 align:middle line:90%
that connect the two.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.190 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:27.700 align:middle line:84%
True Torah learning cannot be
without both of the hemispheres

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.030 align:middle line:90%
working together simultaneously.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And therefore in traditional
Torah, it's silly at best,

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:41.630 align:middle line:84%
it's absurd and even
tragic at worst,

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:46.050 align:middle line:84%
that anyone would think they
can open up the written Torah,

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.630 align:middle line:84%
known in the world
as the Old Testament,

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:53.789 align:middle line:84%
and read it and expect to truly
understand what it's saying.

00:09:53.789 --> 00:09:54.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.510 align:middle line:84%
So that brings up a
rash of questions.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.140 align:middle line:84%
One of them is, then have the
two been combined into written

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.550 align:middle line:84%
form so that a novice
can pick up and begin

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:06.970 align:middle line:84%
integrating the oral and
the written, so to speak,

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.030 align:middle line:90%
in the written language?

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.359 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like vowels-- replete
with vowels and things.

00:10:10.359 --> 00:10:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Precisely.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.080 align:middle line:90%
So now enter Talmud.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:14.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:15.190 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: Talmud, in
general, is the summation

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.160 align:middle line:84%
of the oral Torah,
originally the oral Torah.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.154 align:middle line:84%
Everyone thinks that when
Moses was on Mount Sinai,

00:10:27.154 --> 00:10:28.320 align:middle line:90%
he got the Ten Commandments.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.589 align:middle line:84%
It was so much,
much more than that.

00:10:30.589 --> 00:10:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Remember, he was up there
for 40 days, 40 nights.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:33.710 align:middle line:90%
What was he doing?

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:34.440 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.720 align:middle line:90%
He was receiving the oral Torah.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.460 align:middle line:84%
He was being taught by
the divine mind itself.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, originally,
it was forbidden

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.550 align:middle line:84%
to write down the oral
Torah because part

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:48.940 align:middle line:84%
of the idea of
oral is that-- it's

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.270 align:middle line:84%
like if we took a snapshot of
this right here going on right

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.590 align:middle line:90%
now and that's all you knew.

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.000 align:middle line:84%
You can show that
to 1,000 people

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and get 1,000
interpretations of that.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:10:59.170 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:05.800 align:middle line:84%
So it had to remain oral,
live, like a running video.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.300 align:middle line:84%
However, beginning in the second
century after the Common Era,

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.610 align:middle line:84%
due to the persecutions, the
exile, the whole breakdown

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:17.590 align:middle line:84%
of the transmission system
from master to disciple,

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:22.980 align:middle line:84%
it was then divine permission
was given to write down

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.630 align:middle line:90%
parts of the oral Torah.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:29.189 align:middle line:84%
So yes, Regina, the oral
Torah now is all written down.

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:29.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.040 align:middle line:90%
So now I have two questions.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.420 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to Moses.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.542 align:middle line:84%
Now, if Moses was historically
part of an Egyptian lineage,

00:11:35.542 --> 00:11:37.500 align:middle line:84%
it makes sense he wouldn't
be writing this down

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:90%
in Hebrew, right?

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, according
to some history,

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:46.180 align:middle line:84%
he was part of a royal
Egyptian family who

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:51.510 align:middle line:84%
then came into being as
a representative and one

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.400 align:middle line:84%
who was bringing information
in for the new clan, the Hebrew

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.040 align:middle line:90%
clan.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I always
wondered, how does

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.140 align:middle line:84%
that transmission
occur that ultimately

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.829 align:middle line:90%
came to be in Hebrew?

00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:03.370 align:middle line:84%
There had to be a
way of transmitting

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.240 align:middle line:84%
via kind of very pure
thoughts and concepts,

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.710 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, in order
for him to even integrate

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:12.451 align:middle line:84%
that enough to be able to share
it and pass this knowledge on,

00:12:12.451 --> 00:12:12.950 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.469 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because there's a
language barrier of sorts.

00:12:15.469 --> 00:12:18.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: So whatever
Moses received

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:22.750 align:middle line:84%
from his Egyptian
heritage, that was greatly

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.430 align:middle line:84%
augmented by what
he then received

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.310 align:middle line:84%
through the direct transmission
on Mount Sinai, which

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:34.420 align:middle line:84%
not only included the written
Torah, the Five Books of Moses

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:39.120 align:middle line:84%
but also this very,
very vast oral Torah.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.560 align:middle line:84%
That is everything that's
written in between the lines.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.310 align:middle line:90%
It qualifies everything.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:47.474 align:middle line:84%
It's really absurd to think
that we can read-- take

00:12:47.474 --> 00:12:48.640 align:middle line:90%
a look at the written Torah.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.750 align:middle line:84%
There are things
in there that are

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:55.470 align:middle line:90%
mentioned in one brief passing.

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.370 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really mean
anything in and of itself

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:02.747 align:middle line:84%
until we bring in all
the vast information

00:13:02.747 --> 00:13:04.330 align:middle line:84%
from the oral tradition
of what that--

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.446 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: --intended to mean.

00:13:06.446 --> 00:13:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
if he's receiving

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:14.270 align:middle line:84%
a divine, pure transmission,
it goes beyond language anyway.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're being
downloaded with direct concepts

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and understandings that can then
be translated down the road.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.410 align:middle line:84%
But as you say, over the
next however many years,

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:25.800 align:middle line:84%
the translation started
becoming corrupted,

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.150 align:middle line:84%
which happens as you pass
stories down from generation

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.160 align:middle line:90%
to generation, right?

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: No.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.890 align:middle line:84%
I didn't say it
became corrupted.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:31.910 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:36.560 align:middle line:84%
To the contrary, the
Torah, the oral Torah,

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.175 align:middle line:84%
has a built-in system
that's self-correcting.

00:13:40.175 --> 00:13:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what
does that tell us?

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.466 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: Well, it's
a whole methodology.

00:13:43.466 --> 00:13:46.290 align:middle line:84%
This is what's very
little known in the world.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Torah, in this sense,
is not a religion

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:53.900 align:middle line:84%
based upon feelings and ideas
and speculations and theories.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.050 align:middle line:90%
It's really a hard science.

00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And it comes with an
extensive methodology

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:04.740 align:middle line:84%
of how-- when we open up
the written Torah-- how

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.440 align:middle line:90%
do we now decipher?

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.660 align:middle line:90%
It's all code.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.980 align:middle line:90%
That's a computer code.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And in truth, even though
it says "In the beginning,

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.700 align:middle line:84%
God created--" the truth is
what is being revealed there

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:20.580 align:middle line:84%
on the surface is nothing
more than-- remember

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:25.260 align:middle line:84%
in "2001 Space Odyssey," the
monkey men, the black obelisk?

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: They could touch it.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.647 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have a
clue what it was.

00:14:32.647 --> 00:14:33.730 align:middle line:90%
It is not an exaggeration.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.271 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're saying it's
like a binary code literally.

00:14:36.271 --> 00:14:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yeah.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And the methodology
is very specific.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:43.910 align:middle line:84%
There are rules,
just like in science.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And everything has to be--
it's like an experiment.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:48.790 align:middle line:90%
You do an experiment.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Your colleague has to be able to
replicate exactly what you did

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and come to the
same conclusions.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, everything is
open to peer group critique.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's always been
the way of the Torah.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.230 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Talmud
specifically,

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:13.910 align:middle line:84%
which is an ongoing live
discussion of everything that's

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:19.480 align:middle line:84%
written in the binary code,
of how to understand it

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.110 align:middle line:90%
and how to apply that.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And that code is essentially--
the whole methodology

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:36.240 align:middle line:84%
is what can only be learned
from a teacher who learned it

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.045 align:middle line:84%
from his teacher,
from his master.

00:15:39.045 --> 00:15:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's written
down, here's the thing,

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.520 align:middle line:84%
someone could pick
up-- and the Talmud

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.634 align:middle line:84%
has been translated
into English.

00:15:46.634 --> 00:15:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get into
that in a second--

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: But anyone--

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:49.738 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But go ahead.

00:15:49.738 --> 00:15:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: --who
opens it up is going

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:57.440 align:middle line:84%
to be lost immediately because
it requires apprenticeship.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.071 align:middle line:84%
It requires years and
decades of studying--

00:16:00.071 --> 00:16:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To be able to read--

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: --by a master--

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the layers
under the layers.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:04.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:06.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: And even to
start with, the Torah

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.414 align:middle line:90%
does not talk on one level.

00:16:07.414 --> 00:16:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: It's well-known
the Torah has four levels--

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.380 align:middle line:90%
dimensions of exploration.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.204 align:middle line:84%
And I'm purposely not using
the word "interpretation."

00:16:16.204 --> 00:16:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exploration.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: OK?

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: If you have
scientific fact,

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.850 align:middle line:84%
you're not making
an interpretation.

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:25.030 align:middle line:90%
That is the fact.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:26.830 align:middle line:90%
Those are the facts of physics.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And so when the Talmudic mind,
when the Talmudists-- now,

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.120 align:middle line:84%
every Talmudist in the ancient
times, not so long ago,

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.330 align:middle line:90%
was also a Kabbalist.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, and this
is not very well-known,

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:49.480 align:middle line:84%
about a quarter to a third of
the whole Talmud is Kabbalah.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.920 align:middle line:90%
But it is so well-concealed.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.670 align:middle line:90%
It's hidden in stories.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:55.320 align:middle line:90%
It's hidden in aphorisms.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.270 align:middle line:84%
It's hidden in things
that look like legends

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:59.540 align:middle line:84%
of the Jews, things that
look like fairy tales.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.791 align:middle line:90%
The masters were so clever.

00:17:01.791 --> 00:17:02.290 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:05.079 align:middle line:90%
They're masters of cryptology.

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:07.079 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have
something that's

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.484 align:middle line:84%
so precious, so
profound, something

00:17:09.484 --> 00:17:11.579 align:middle line:84%
that's coming from
another dimension,

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:14.000 align:middle line:90%
and you have to transmit it.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.319 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be very
careful to protect it

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:24.130 align:middle line:84%
and not to allow those that
are not fitting to access it

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.510 align:middle line:90%
or that would abuse it--

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:26.319 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Denigrate
it in some way.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:27.902 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: --and
denigrate it like that.

00:17:27.902 --> 00:17:33.160 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be able to
teach it, pass it down in a way

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.840 align:middle line:84%
that the information
is there, but it's not

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:40.170 align:middle line:84%
readily observable, knowable,
to anyone from the outside

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.310 align:middle line:84%
until you know the code
of how to break it.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.200 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And so now there are,
certainly in recent times

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.480 align:middle line:84%
and, again, like
what Madonna did

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.590 align:middle line:84%
for bringing the Kabbalah
to our awareness,

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.740 align:middle line:84%
you might say Dan
Brown did with a lot

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:00.540 align:middle line:84%
of the mystical Christian
teachings, so to speak.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And again, this notion of
scholars throughout the past

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.950 align:middle line:84%
being involved in the
reinterpretation--

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:09.620 align:middle line:84%
in this case, a
reinterpretation.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.520 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying that
even just looking

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.630 align:middle line:84%
at something like
the King James Bible,

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.860 align:middle line:84%
for example, and the
interpretations that took place

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:20.800 align:middle line:84%
during that period of time
with the Christian texts, which

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.880 align:middle line:84%
were primarily-- I mean,
my understanding-- as more

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.160 align:middle line:90%
politically motivated.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.900 align:middle line:84%
There are certain parts that no
longer exist in the Christian

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.050 align:middle line:90%
Bible.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:33.070 align:middle line:84%
You're saying that in
the Talmud, in the Torah,

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.310 align:middle line:90%
this is not the case.

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:39.110 align:middle line:84%
There haven't been severe edits,
edits for political expediency

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:40.320 align:middle line:90%
and such throughout history.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.189 align:middle line:84%
It stayed in a pure
state this whole time?

00:18:42.189 --> 00:18:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: That is correct.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:49.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, even if there was a
dispute, an argument about any

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:84%
of the thousands of
matters, the minority view

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.420 align:middle line:90%
is always kept alive.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:01.220 align:middle line:84%
It may not be the one that's
most applicable at any given

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.630 align:middle line:90%
time and place.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:06.230 align:middle line:84%
But the minority view
is never discarded,

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:09.524 align:middle line:84%
and it is given as much
validity as the majority view--

00:19:09.524 --> 00:19:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's good.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: --because if the proper
methodology is applied, then

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.520 align:middle line:84%
it is also reflecting
the spiritual truth.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.140 align:middle line:84%
The whole Torah is
higher dimensionality

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:28.610 align:middle line:84%
that is now being manifest
into our lower dimension.

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:30.679 align:middle line:90%
Very difficult thing to do.

00:19:30.679 --> 00:19:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.678 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: It's like
literally trying

00:19:32.678 --> 00:19:34.980 align:middle line:84%
to get an elephant through
the eye of a needle.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.470 align:middle line:84%
So when we come
into this dimension,

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.420 align:middle line:90%
we have to go right or left.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.150 align:middle line:90%
We have to make choices here.

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:42.510 align:middle line:90%
We're in a higher dimension.

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:46.525 align:middle line:84%
Both aspects can co-exist
and do exist simultaneously.

00:19:46.525 --> 00:19:47.330 align:middle line:90%
And no problem.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:47.913 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:47.913 --> 00:19:50.820 align:middle line:84%
We have more duality
in this level.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: But this
is the beauty of it.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:56.015 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is ever rejected.

00:19:56.015 --> 00:19:57.750 align:middle line:84%
You have to know how
to play the game.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:58.650 align:middle line:90%
It's a master game.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Once you learn the
techniques, you can join it.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it's
a master game that

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:06.530 align:middle line:84%
goes on throughout
the generations

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:10.230 align:middle line:84%
and never really even stopped,
even though the basic parts had

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:11.060 align:middle line:90%
been written down.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:17.440 align:middle line:84%
It is the original internet
that spans across millennia.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.690 align:middle line:90%
It's really quite astounding.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And the Talmud covers
literally every single subject

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.410 align:middle line:90%
that we could possibly imagine.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not just Jewish law.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.930 align:middle line:90%
It's philosophy, theology.

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:32.200 align:middle line:90%
It's psychology.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.965 align:middle line:90%
It's sexuality.

00:20:33.965 --> 00:20:34.590 align:middle line:90%
It's sociology.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:35.550 align:middle line:90%


00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:41.610 align:middle line:84%
It deals with everyday
life issues and problems.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.770 align:middle line:84%
It deals with issues between
men and women and parents

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:45.910 align:middle line:90%
and children.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:47.910 align:middle line:90%
It's all in there.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:52.730 align:middle line:84%
But if one develops and
has the eyes to see,

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:59.370 align:middle line:84%
this is all echoing higher
dimensionality, how it now

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:04.230 align:middle line:84%
manifests into our everyday
existence which then enables

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:10.020 align:middle line:84%
us to reunite our lower
dimensionality back

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.950 align:middle line:84%
in with the higher
dimensionality.

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, even
the Torah that we

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:18.256 align:middle line:84%
have now-- the
written Torah, as it

00:21:18.256 --> 00:21:21.830 align:middle line:84%
was revealed at Mount
Sinai-- in itself

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:28.600 align:middle line:84%
is a lower dimensional replica
of a higher-dimensional Torah,

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.950 align:middle line:84%
which, as I said earlier,
is really the mind of God.

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:36.630 align:middle line:84%
It's God's own consciousness
that he is projecting

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:39.030 align:middle line:90%
into this lower dimension.

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:42.500 align:middle line:84%
The assumption here is that this
lower dimension was actually

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.520 align:middle line:90%
part of the higher dimension.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.990 align:middle line:90%
Something fell out.

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.970 align:middle line:90%
That's the famous--

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:48.636 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That story
goes throughout all

00:21:48.636 --> 00:21:49.730 align:middle line:90%
of the world's traditions.

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes, yes.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.010 align:middle line:84%
But basically, we're all trying
to get back to the garden.

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: OK?

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: And that
we're trying to find

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:02.610 align:middle line:84%
our roots, our individual and
collective roots, in what's

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.470 align:middle line:84%
referred to in the common
law as the higher dimensional

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:10.530 align:middle line:84%
body of Adam, the original
Adam, who was-- very important,

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.310 align:middle line:90%
the term "Adam" is androgynous.

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:14.660 align:middle line:90%
That's male and female.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Every human being is
like a cell in that body.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Every animal is part of that
body in every vegetable, plant,

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:22.850 align:middle line:90%
and mineral.

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:25.826 align:middle line:84%
The Jewish vision from
the very beginning,

00:22:25.826 --> 00:22:31.490 align:middle line:84%
from the get go, before there
was any idea of global unity

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:34.500 align:middle line:84%
and we're all one family-- OK,
we're talking about thousands

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.680 align:middle line:90%
of years ago.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you read the words of
the prophets, it's very evident.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.540 align:middle line:84%
All reality, our
humanity, is viewed

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:45.580 align:middle line:90%
as a single Adamic-like form.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.400 align:middle line:90%
We're all cells in that body.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And the whole purpose,
the modus operandi

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:54.760 align:middle line:84%
of this very existence, is
to bring all the parts back

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.430 align:middle line:84%
into the whole,
and then the whole

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:58.630 align:middle line:84%
is greater than the sum
of the individual parts.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And then we have what is
known as the Messianic Era.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:07.960 align:middle line:84%
The Messianic Era, which
is very, very fundamental,

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.770 align:middle line:84%
is it's not mythology,
and it is not legends.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:14.100 align:middle line:84%
This is really what we're
all aspiring towards.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:18.540 align:middle line:84%
This is when we
become, once again,

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:25.270 align:middle line:84%
this single consciousness slash
reality going back to-- we're

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:29.260 align:middle line:84%
coming full circle
back to where we began.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:33.049 align:middle line:90%
So Talmud is the oral Torah.

00:23:33.049 --> 00:23:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: The written Torah would
be like the left brain of God.

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:36.571 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:36.571 --> 00:23:40.737 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: The Talmud would be
like the right brain of God.

00:23:40.737 --> 00:23:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, great.

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: And the
corpus callosum?

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes?

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: When I learned
Torah, I become, in effect,

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:50.370 align:middle line:90%
the cosmic corpus callosum.

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:51.330 align:middle line:90%
I am bridging.

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I am uniting together the
cosmic left and right brains,

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:middle line:84%
the written Torah with the oral
Torah, and this creates unity.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.943 align:middle line:84%
This creates a profound harmony,
and this is called tikkun.

00:24:01.943 --> 00:24:04.030 align:middle line:84%
"Tikkun" is perhaps
the most important word

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:05.530 align:middle line:90%
in the Jewish tradition.

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:10.300 align:middle line:90%
It means rectification, fixing.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:14.380 align:middle line:84%
The whole purpose is
to fix, to mend that

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:18.009 align:middle line:90%
which has been torn asunder.

00:24:18.009 --> 00:24:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Now let's start weaving
in, as the overlay,

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:27.640 align:middle line:84%
I suppose, or maybe the
underpinnings, the Kabbalah.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: OK.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So what does the
word "Kabbalah" mean?

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah simply
means that which has

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:middle line:84%
been received, orally from
teacher all the way going back

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.230 align:middle line:90%
to Moses.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And let me just emphasize
also, my tradition

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:47.370 align:middle line:84%
goes back not just to
Moses on Mount Sinai,

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:50.470 align:middle line:84%
but back to Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob and to the matriarchs,

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:55.260 align:middle line:84%
and even further back to
great-great-grandfather

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Enoch, the seventh
generation from Adam.

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And as astounding
as it may sound,

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to trace my
tradition and my teachings

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.900 align:middle line:84%
back to Adam, to
the original Adam.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.940 align:middle line:84%
So Kabbalah means that
which has been received.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And originally, the entire
oral Torah was called Kabbalah.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.400 align:middle line:90%
That's not very well-known.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.370 align:middle line:84%
There was the
written, and there was

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:25.090 align:middle line:84%
that which was the
Kabbalah received orally.

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:29.090 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, beginning
around the second century,

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:33.000 align:middle line:84%
due to various sociological,
historical factors,

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.510 align:middle line:90%
it started to be written down.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:37.020 align:middle line:84%
The last part of the oral
tradition to be written down

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.539 align:middle line:84%
was what we now
call the Kabbalah.

00:25:38.539 --> 00:25:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:43.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where the science
is woven in as well, not just

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:48.280 align:middle line:84%
the rules or laws that help
govern society and philosophy

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:48.920 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.940 align:middle line:84%
But now we're talking
numbers, geometry,

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.210 align:middle line:84%
all of these other
aspects of code, right?

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:55.850 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes, yes.

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:58.320 align:middle line:84%
The Kabbalah, as I mentioned
earlier, is so vast.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:02.482 align:middle line:84%
It is not an exaggeration to say
it's like the word "science,"

00:26:02.482 --> 00:26:04.190 align:middle line:84%
which could mean so
many different things

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:05.101 align:middle line:90%
to different people.

00:26:05.101 --> 00:26:05.600 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.920 align:middle line:84%
So the Kabbalah is
the oral tradition.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:15.320 align:middle line:84%
But specifically, it
is the esoteric aspect

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.979 align:middle line:90%
of the oral tradition.

00:26:16.979 --> 00:26:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: Here's another
way to understand it.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:21.460 align:middle line:90%
The written Torah is the body.

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:22.759 align:middle line:90%
The oral Torah is the soul.

00:26:22.759 --> 00:26:23.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: OK?

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:26.720 align:middle line:90%
There's a soul to the soul.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.250 align:middle line:90%
That's the Kabbalah.

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:30.140 align:middle line:84%
What is now known
in the world-- we

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.460 align:middle line:90%
said the cat's out of the bag.

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.787 align:middle line:90%
There's so many species of cats.

00:26:35.787 --> 00:26:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: There's domesticated
cats, and there's wild cats.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're still finding new
species of feline creatures.

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:49.640 align:middle line:84%
So the term "Kabbalah"
almost doesn't mean anything

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:53.810 align:middle line:84%
because it can mean
so many things.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:57.420 align:middle line:84%
It is, in general,
the inner soul.

00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Look, we're all
spiritually-based people here,

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:03.800 align:middle line:84%
anyone who's listening,
and we have to assume that.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:04.840 align:middle line:90%
We know we have a body.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:06.000 align:middle line:90%
We know we have a soul.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.570 align:middle line:90%
And Torah is no different.

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:12.220 align:middle line:84%
It has the external aspect,
and it has the internal aspect.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.190 align:middle line:90%
They are not separate.

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:16.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they fit
together isomorphically,

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:21.020 align:middle line:90%
like a hand inside of a glove.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:25.490 align:middle line:84%
When one learns Torah,
it is a process.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:27.000 align:middle line:90%
It's not academic learning.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.120 align:middle line:84%
You are actually
becoming a partner

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.660 align:middle line:90%
with the divine mind itself.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.100 align:middle line:84%
As I mentioned, I
become, in effect,

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:37.260 align:middle line:84%
this cosmic corpus
callosum bridging together

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.740 align:middle line:84%
the left side of creation with
the right side of creation.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.190 align:middle line:84%
This is, in general, what
the Kabbalah is doing.

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:48.380 align:middle line:84%
It's simply adding
to the unification

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.560 align:middle line:84%
from the left side
and the right side.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Because the more
that we understand

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.480 align:middle line:84%
about the soul,
strangely enough,

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.520 align:middle line:84%
the more we have the capacity
to understand about the body

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.147 align:middle line:84%
and how it functions, which
is still so much of a mystery.

00:28:02.147 --> 00:28:02.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into
one of those primary seats

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:05.730 align:middle line:90%
eventually--

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:06.704 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes, yes, yes.

00:28:06.704 --> 00:28:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --in a little bit.

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:10.530 align:middle line:90%
But I wonder this.

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:13.260 align:middle line:84%
As you were talking about the
oral Torah, the written Torah,

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:16.970 align:middle line:84%
the Talmud, and then
the Kabbalah overlay,

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:20.380 align:middle line:84%
is this true in other of the
world's ancient traditions

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.040 align:middle line:84%
as well, where you
have an oral and you

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:26.790 align:middle line:84%
have a written and similar
cosmic principles flowing

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:27.930 align:middle line:90%
through?

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: Regina, I'll
answer you this way.

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:33.050 align:middle line:90%
There very may well have been.

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:35.531 align:middle line:90%


00:28:35.531 --> 00:28:36.030 align:middle line:90%
But today--

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But it's not-- yeah.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: --where are the
living oral traditions

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:44.790 align:middle line:84%
that can be legitimately
traced back?

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:47.610 align:middle line:84%
This is what I learned
from my teacher.

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Someone could say I studied
from my teacher for 10, 20,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:51.790 align:middle line:90%
30 years.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:52.810 align:middle line:90%
He studied from his.

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:54.030 align:middle line:90%
We know who that person is.

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And then we can trace
it all the way back.

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:56.280 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Is anyone from any
religion, mystical group,

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:01.530 align:middle line:84%
society can come
forward and say, here,

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:04.099 align:middle line:84%
I have an ancient
tradition together

00:29:04.099 --> 00:29:05.140 align:middle line:90%
with a written tradition.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.267 align:middle line:84%
Now, together with
this, the problem

00:29:07.267 --> 00:29:09.350 align:middle line:84%
is compounded because
there's many traditions that

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:10.480 align:middle line:90%
have no written tradition.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: It's only oral.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.386 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:12.386 --> 00:29:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: And then
we have fragments

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:17.857 align:middle line:84%
of written traditions, but
there's no oral tradition

00:29:17.857 --> 00:29:18.440 align:middle line:90%
to go with it.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.000 align:middle line:90%
That's been lost.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.920 align:middle line:90%
So it's almost moot.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:22.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Code of Hammurabi, where you
got this epic of Gilgamesh

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:26.700 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gilgamesh, yeah.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: We are the monkey
men with the black obelisk

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:33.980 align:middle line:90%
in "2001, A Space Odyssey."

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And everyone comes in with this
speculation and this theory

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:38.120 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.405 align:middle line:90%
That's not science.

00:29:40.405 --> 00:29:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And "mysticism"-- well,
I don't use that word.

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I try to avoid that word as much
as possible because, in fact,

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.390 align:middle line:84%
as shocking as it
may sound, there

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:52.210 align:middle line:84%
is no such thing as
Jewish mysticism.

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah is not
Jewish mysticism,

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:56.635 align:middle line:84%
not if we're going to approach
it from any religious--

00:29:56.635 --> 00:29:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's science.

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:58.426 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: --theological
perspective

00:29:58.426 --> 00:30:02.910 align:middle line:84%
where you have-- Here's
a religion, say, Islam,

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:04.850 align:middle line:90%
basic fundamental this and that.

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And then you got Sufism,
which is the mystical branch.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Likewise in Christianity,
you got the mystical branch,

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:15.430 align:middle line:84%
but for all practical
purposes, very separate.

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And the proof is
that the mainstream

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:22.390 align:middle line:84%
of Christianity and/or of
Islam, just for examples, they

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:26.112 align:middle line:84%
were often very antagonistic
towards the mystical strain.

00:30:26.112 --> 00:30:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or knew nothing of.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:29.361 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: Or knew nothing
of and totally rejected.

00:30:29.361 --> 00:30:32.800 align:middle line:90%
Not so in the Kabbalah.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Virtually every single rabbi,
up to relatively recent,

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.199 align:middle line:84%
if he was a Talmudist,
he was a Kabbalist.

00:30:40.199 --> 00:30:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: He was a
biblical scholar.

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.470 align:middle line:90%
He was an ethicist.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:51.250 align:middle line:84%
You had to be all these things,
or you couldn't be in the club.

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And so if there seems to be such
a-- there's been a breakdown.

00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:00.170 align:middle line:84%
We've lost all those
oral traditions.

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah, as the name implies,
is first and foremost part

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.979 align:middle line:84%
of an unbroken
chain of tradition.

00:31:07.979 --> 00:31:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: Now, keep in mind
that a lot of the tradition

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:11.980 align:middle line:90%
was written down.

00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:14.460 align:middle line:90%
It was encrypted.

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that
might look like a fairy tale.

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:21.030 align:middle line:10%
If you know the
code, it's astounding

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:25.500 align:middle line:10%
what they were able
to encrypt in to what

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:29.759 align:middle line:10%
appears to be on the surface.

00:31:29.759 --> 00:31:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:34.154 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to
make a really big leap.

00:31:34.154 --> 00:31:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: Going to make a
big leap to a little organ.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.236 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we are.

00:31:37.236 --> 00:31:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for laying
the background down for us.

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:42.000 align:middle line:84%
So I have a greater
understanding now

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.430 align:middle line:90%
as a result of what you said.

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:48.080 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to this
one little puzzle.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.120 align:middle line:84%
I wrote here that it started
falling into place for you

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.770 align:middle line:84%
with your understanding
of the Foundation Stone.

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:56.080 align:middle line:84%
So once we talk about
the Foundation Stone,

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.157 align:middle line:84%
then I want to leap
to the pineal, DMT,

00:31:59.157 --> 00:32:00.240 align:middle line:90%
and the rest of the story.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Sure.

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:09.040 align:middle line:84%
There is in the land of Israel
in the city of Jerusalem

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:12.670 align:middle line:84%
on what's known as the Temple
Mount, where King Solomon's

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Temple stood for
410 years and then

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:19.735 align:middle line:84%
where the temple known as
Herod's Temple, destroyed

00:32:19.735 --> 00:32:20.620 align:middle line:90%
in the year 70.

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:23.690 align:middle line:84%
After the Common Era,
it stood for 420 years.

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:27.770 align:middle line:84%
What's this whole
temple thing all about?

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:34.570 align:middle line:10%
The temple was all
for a large room that

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:36.080 align:middle line:10%
was called the Holy of Holies.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.270 align:middle line:84%
What was the Holy
of Holies about?

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:41.110 align:middle line:84%
It all sat on top of what's
known as the Foundation Stone.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:43.630 align:middle line:84%
In Hebrew, it's
"Even ha-Shetiyah."

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:48.940 align:middle line:84%
That space, that rock,
that outcrop of rock

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:54.820 align:middle line:84%
is where Abraham
bound his son Isaac,

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:56.260 align:middle line:90%
the famous binding of Isaac.

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.420 align:middle line:90%
That is where that took place.

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:01.270 align:middle line:84%
That is also where, a
generation later, Jacob

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:06.820 align:middle line:84%
had his most famous dream of
the ladder connecting heaven

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.890 align:middle line:84%
and earth and these
angelic entities ascending

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:10.780 align:middle line:90%
and descending upon.

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:14.355 align:middle line:84%
That took place on
the Foundation Stone.

00:33:14.355 --> 00:33:16.230 align:middle line:84%
That's where he laid
his head down, literally

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:18.420 align:middle line:90%
on the Foundation Stone.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:20.480 align:middle line:84%
The Foundation
Stone, its tradition

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.020 align:middle line:90%
goes back even further.

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, as much as we
can try to express that which

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.650 align:middle line:84%
we cannot, this was the
inception point of creation

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:30.340 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:34.226 align:middle line:84%
This is all taking place
within the Godhead.

00:33:34.226 --> 00:33:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wait.

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:38.490 align:middle line:84%
So what is the evidence
it's the inception place?

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.789 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: That's the
tradition that's handed down.

00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:43.163 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: And that's why
specifically Abraham

00:33:43.163 --> 00:33:44.450 align:middle line:90%
went to that spot.

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.444 align:middle line:84%
That is why Jacob
went specifically--

00:33:46.444 --> 00:33:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, because
it was in the tradition?

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.526 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: --because they
knew of this tradition, yes.

00:33:50.526 --> 00:33:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And then many, many
centuries later, King David

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:58.200 align:middle line:90%
purchased that area.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:04.520 align:middle line:84%
It was owned by a
Jevosite, and King David

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:05.780 align:middle line:90%
purchased it from him.

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.460 align:middle line:84%
It was formerly a
threshing floor.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And he laid out all the
architectural blueprints

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.159 align:middle line:84%
for the temple, which
was then constructed

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:20.960 align:middle line:84%
by his son King Solomon
specifically on that spot.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.179 align:middle line:84%
There's just a host
of what appears

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:28.040 align:middle line:84%
to be legends and
fantastical descriptions

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:32.330 align:middle line:84%
of the significance
of this spot.

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, that rock, as I said,
the Foundation Stone,

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:41.530 align:middle line:84%
during the period
of the first temple,

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:45.620 align:middle line:84%
that is where the Ark of
the Covenant was placed.

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:47.730 align:middle line:84%
The Ark of the Covenant--
everybody knows it from

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:51.139 align:middle line:84%
"Indiana Jones"--
is a golden box,

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:55.610 align:middle line:84%
and it has these two cherubic
creatures that are standing

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:57.720 align:middle line:90%
on top of it.

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
relevant to know when

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:02.830 align:middle line:84%
we start talking
about the pineal gland

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:07.180 align:middle line:84%
that these two angelic
entities were male and female.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.236 align:middle line:90%
Did you know that?

00:35:08.236 --> 00:35:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I read that, yes.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.367 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: OK.

00:35:10.367 --> 00:35:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's inside the box?

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.040 align:middle line:90%
That's what people want to know.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:13.539 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Oh.

00:35:13.539 --> 00:35:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, inside the box was
the set of the original Ten

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:20.310 align:middle line:90%
Commandments, essentially.

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:21.380 align:middle line:90%
That's what it was.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm only asking
because Laurence Gardner

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.510 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of other
work that's come up

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:29.420 align:middle line:84%
have thought that there were
other elements inside there,

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:33.250 align:middle line:84%
such as ormus the transformative
white gold, so to speak.

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yeah.

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:40.300 align:middle line:84%
My approach to these
speculations and theories is

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:45.320 align:middle line:84%
that if anyone really
knew the Kabbalah,

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:51.040 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking about profuse
mathematical formulas behind

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:53.690 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Covenant and
what all these things are truly

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:58.620 align:middle line:84%
representing, and that, in
fact, it is a vortex-- that is,

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:03.360 align:middle line:84%
the point singularity connecting
this dimensionality with higher

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:08.252 align:middle line:84%
dimensionality-- one
wouldn't need to even--

00:36:08.252 --> 00:36:09.085 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Speculate.

00:36:09.085 --> 00:36:11.001 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: --come up,
speculate, because there's

00:36:11.001 --> 00:36:14.230 align:middle line:84%
so much going on there
without that to begin with.

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
the profundity of the Ark now

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:18.350 align:middle line:90%
and what it is being--

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: OK.

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --as a portal.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:23.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: The most profound thing
we need to know about the Ark

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:29.880 align:middle line:84%
is the Foundation Stone
because the Ark, in effect,

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:34.990 align:middle line:84%
simply acted as an amplifier for
the essence of the Foundation

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:36.270 align:middle line:90%
Stone.

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Between those two
cherubim, there

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:41.030 align:middle line:90%
was a vortex that opened up.

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:45.390 align:middle line:84%
When the prophets would enter
into a state of prophecy,

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:48.950 align:middle line:84%
they did so by projecting
their consciousness

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:51.052 align:middle line:90%
in between the two cherubim.

00:36:51.052 --> 00:36:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Two cherubim.

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:54.882 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: Before the
time of the temple,

00:36:54.882 --> 00:36:56.090 align:middle line:90%
it was called the Tabernacle.

00:36:56.090 --> 00:37:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was a mobile temple,
and in the desert with Moses

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:04.250 align:middle line:90%
and the children of Israel.

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And the divine voice
from the higher dimension

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:14.470 align:middle line:84%
literally spoke to
Moses, communicated

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:17.590 align:middle line:84%
through that
vortex-- a stargate,

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:22.950 align:middle line:84%
a virtual Star of
David stargate.

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And so it was
literally the portal

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:30.070 align:middle line:84%
that is the way back into
the higher dimension.

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:33.930 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, the
Ark of the Covenant

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:35.940 align:middle line:90%
has its ability on its own.

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.349 align:middle line:84%
And due to the holographic
principle of reality,

00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:40.140 align:middle line:84%
there is an element to
the Foundation Stone

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.275 align:middle line:90%
everywhere in the world.

00:37:41.275 --> 00:37:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Now we can understand
why there's

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:43.930 align:middle line:90%
this holy rock over here.

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:45.630 align:middle line:84%
There's this holy
mountain over here.

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:46.402 align:middle line:90%
It's all true.

00:37:46.402 --> 00:37:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and it said
there are a number of stargates

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:49.480 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes.

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:55.120 align:middle line:84%
But when you now take the
Ark of the Covenant and place

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.040 align:middle line:84%
it on top of the
Foundation Stone here--

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This
highly-activated area, yes.

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: OK.

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And indicative of
this, that this

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:08.960 align:middle line:84%
is kind of like a meta-stargate
that sends out meridians

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:14.690 align:middle line:84%
to all the other stargates,
but that they all

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:21.050 align:middle line:90%
cross-section in this stargate.

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:23.552 align:middle line:84%
Historically-- if
you were a Martian,

00:38:23.552 --> 00:38:25.010 align:middle line:84%
and you were coming
to planet Earth

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:26.384 align:middle line:84%
and looked at all
of the history,

00:38:26.384 --> 00:38:29.020 align:middle line:84%
the biggest question
you would have would be,

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:32.240 align:middle line:90%
what is unique about this spot?

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.350 align:middle line:84%
This spot, where the temple
stood, where Jerusalem was,

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:38.430 align:middle line:84%
has been conquered
and reconquered

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:41.830 align:middle line:84%
by more nations than any
other piece of geography

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:42.940 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:46.990 align:middle line:84%
We, as spiritual
investigators, must ask why?

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:49.010 align:middle line:90%
What is going on here?

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:55.900 align:middle line:84%
If we were to see-- like they
show you on maps of airlines,

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.670 align:middle line:84%
and you see all
the crisscrossing.

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.128 align:middle line:84%
And you see there's
a heck of a lot

00:38:59.128 --> 00:39:00.780 align:middle line:84%
more going out through
New York and LA

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:03.614 align:middle line:84%
than there is through
Boulder, Colorado.

00:39:03.614 --> 00:39:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: OK?

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And so by the same
token, if we were

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:12.830 align:middle line:84%
to take a picture, time
lapse of the planet Earth,

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:13.860 align:middle line:90%
it's indisputable.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:15.860 align:middle line:84%
There's something going
on there because there's

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:17.720 align:middle line:84%
more activity
there than there is

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.350 align:middle line:90%
any other place in the world.

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:19.975 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:19.975 --> 00:39:22.310 align:middle line:84%
It's said in other
terminology that there's

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:24.320 align:middle line:84%
an incredible
confluence of ley lines

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.725 align:middle line:84%
that are creating this
incredible geodetic

00:39:26.725 --> 00:39:27.225 align:middle line:90%
experience--

00:39:27.225 --> 00:39:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes.

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:27.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --and energy--

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes, yes, yes.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --off-putting,
so to speak.

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: And with
this, we can appreciate

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.680 align:middle line:90%
what King Solomon was doing.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:37.260 align:middle line:84%
It says he was the wisest of
all men-- science, spirituality,

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:38.060 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:40.360 align:middle line:90%
He knew the meridian system.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:40.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: And he was attempting
to reconnect all the veins

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:50.240 align:middle line:84%
and arteries of the entire
planet-- all the wisdoms

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:55.450 align:middle line:84%
from the West, which back then
was of the Egyptian knowledge,

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:59.560 align:middle line:84%
the basis of all Western
occult, which then was morphed

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:03.250 align:middle line:84%
into Greek wisdom, which is
the basis of Western science.

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.953 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: And all the
Eastern wisdom as well.

00:40:06.953 --> 00:40:07.700 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:11.060 align:middle line:84%
He was taking-- in
fact, it's very relevant

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:14.380 align:middle line:84%
to take this model of
split-brain hemisphericity

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.420 align:middle line:84%
and superimpose it
upon the planet Earth.

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, oh my gosh.

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:21.534 align:middle line:84%
The Western world, the
Occident, is the left brain.

00:40:21.534 --> 00:40:22.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: The Orient
is the right brain.

00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And Israel, Jerusalem,
the Foundation Stone

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.835 align:middle line:84%
is in the middle,
and it's no accident.

00:40:28.835 --> 00:40:31.790 align:middle line:84%
It's betwixt the
Occident and the Orient.

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:33.220 align:middle line:90%
It's no accident.

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:36.346 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
just a little idea

00:40:36.346 --> 00:40:37.970 align:middle line:84%
of what this Foundation
Stone is about.

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:38.500 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: --what does that got
to do with the pineal gland?

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: OK.

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then you got
to throw DMT in there too.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: Oh,
absolutely, absolutely.

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:51.110 align:middle line:90%
I was aware of these traditions.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:58.210 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole other
layer to place upon this,

00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and it's known as
the luz bone, L-U-Z.

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:02.456 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: L-U-Z.

00:41:02.456 --> 00:41:05.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: L-U-Z, which
interesting enough--

00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:11.060 align:middle line:84%
and its Romance roots means
light, like in Spanish.

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:17.190 align:middle line:84%
In Hebrew, luz is
a hazelnut tree.

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:20.836 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very strange
story in the Book of Judges.

00:41:20.836 --> 00:41:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And it says that
the tribe of Joseph,

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:28.880 align:middle line:84%
they were entering-- conquering
the land from certain Canaanite

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.240 align:middle line:84%
tribes, and they came
to a city called Luz.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:36.119 align:middle line:84%
And it says that it was
so fortified and hidden,

00:41:36.119 --> 00:41:37.035 align:middle line:90%
there was no entrance.

00:41:37.035 --> 00:41:40.250 align:middle line:84%
It had a secret entrance to get
in, and they couldn't find it.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And they waited for one man to
come out who then showed them

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:48.280 align:middle line:84%
the secret entrance, and it was
hidden behind a giant hazelnut

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.690 align:middle line:90%
tree.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And it led into a cave,
led into a tunnel that

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:55.210 align:middle line:90%
went into this city.

00:41:55.210 --> 00:42:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And it says that they let that
man go with all his family.

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:05.010 align:middle line:84%
It says he went off to the
East, and he built a new city.

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:08.850 align:middle line:84%
He also called it
by the name of Luz.

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Just as a quick little
sidebar, and this

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:15.770 align:middle line:84%
is one of the few places
where I speculate.

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:22.229 align:middle line:84%
There may be a loose
Luz connection to Lhasa.

00:42:22.229 --> 00:42:22.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Luza.

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: OK?

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.717 align:middle line:84%
Which we know is a very, very
ancient, very mystical city.

00:42:28.717 --> 00:42:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: Well, this city
of Luz, both the original

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.400 align:middle line:84%
and the second one,
have all these,

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:36.770 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a better term,
mystical associations with it.

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:38.861 align:middle line:90%
No one died in the city.

00:42:38.861 --> 00:42:39.610 align:middle line:90%
You lived forever.

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:41.943 align:middle line:84%
If you wanted to die, you had
to go outside of the city.

00:42:41.943 --> 00:42:42.540 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:44.550 align:middle line:90%
You could only speak truth.

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:46.529 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So your
website, City of Luz.

00:42:46.529 --> 00:42:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes.

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:51.880 align:middle line:84%
So there was something that was
being practiced or understood

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.560 align:middle line:90%
or consumed or whatnot there?

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes.

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.480 align:middle line:84%
But what's important
and relevant

00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:03.830 align:middle line:84%
is that the city of Luz
that's being described there,

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:08.040 align:middle line:84%
when this was written down,
it was all in encoded because,

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:13.290 align:middle line:84%
in fact, all those descriptions
there are describing

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:17.225 align:middle line:84%
the Foundation Stone, the
place where Jacob had his dream

00:43:17.225 --> 00:43:21.665 align:middle line:84%
and where Abraham and Isaac
were and the two temples were.

00:43:21.665 --> 00:43:25.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there is, in
effect, a secret entrance.

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:26.410 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, I knew all
this information.

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:35.650 align:middle line:84%
So some years ago, I encountered
Dr. Rick Strassman's book.

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:38.830 align:middle line:10%
I began reading it, and
I was just mind-boggled.

00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:41.590 align:middle line:10%
I totally understood everything
he was saying from a Torah

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:43.000 align:middle line:10%
perspective.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.360 align:middle line:84%
He was describing, now from
a physiological/medical

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:52.270 align:middle line:84%
perspective, everything
associated with the Foundation

00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Stone in this
mysterious city of Luz.

00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And based upon all my
research and my conclusions,

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:07.100 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland is known
in Torah literature,

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:10.270 align:middle line:84%
both in the written Torah
and in the oral Torah.

00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:12.410 align:middle line:84%
Because it says there,
most importantly,

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:17.180 align:middle line:84%
when Jacob awoke
from his dream, says

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:21.420 align:middle line:84%
he took a rock, the Foundation,
he set it upright as a pillar.

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:25.590 align:middle line:90%
He poured oil on it.

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:27.590 align:middle line:90%
He gave it a new name.

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:31.050 align:middle line:84%
He said, this little
town now, this section,

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:34.570 align:middle line:84%
is called Beit El,
Bethel, House of God.

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:38.780 align:middle line:84%
But the verse says, however,
its original name was Luz.

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:42.120 align:middle line:90%


00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:47.760 align:middle line:84%
What I gained from Strassman's
research was the model

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:53.090 align:middle line:84%
to understand-- making a long
never-ending story very, very

00:44:53.090 --> 00:45:00.910 align:middle line:84%
short-- as the pineal
gland is to the human body,

00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:06.510 align:middle line:84%
the Foundation Stone is
to the global human body.

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:12.020 align:middle line:84%
All reality-- we know this, as
below, so above, as without,

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:13.360 align:middle line:90%
so within.

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:18.830 align:middle line:84%
The whole temple is actually,
King Solomon's Temple,

00:45:18.830 --> 00:45:22.810 align:middle line:84%
was a replication on
a macrocosmic level

00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:26.220 align:middle line:84%
of the human body and
the parts of the brain.

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And the Foundation Stone
corresponds exactly

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:36.750 align:middle line:84%
to where the pineal gland would
be located in the human brain.

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:39.810 align:middle line:90%


00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:42.270 align:middle line:90%
And what really hit me was this.

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:46.840 align:middle line:84%
I had heard of the pineal
gland due to my understanding

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:50.950 align:middle line:84%
of some Eastern concepts and
Kundalini yoga, the chakras,

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:52.320 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.780 align:middle line:84%
But with this new
research that came out,

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:57.780 align:middle line:84%
which is essentially--
if your listeners are not

00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:01.655 align:middle line:84%
familiar with it, that
the hypothesis is--

00:46:01.655 --> 00:46:03.780 align:middle line:84%
it's not proven yet-- but
there's very, very strong

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:10.140 align:middle line:84%
circumstantial evidence in that
the whole body, different cells

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:13.130 align:middle line:84%
in the body, are able to
produce this endogenous

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:15.754 align:middle line:84%
neurotransmitter or hormone
called dimethyltryptamine.

00:46:15.754 --> 00:46:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:16.855 align:middle line:90%
DMT.

00:46:16.855 --> 00:46:17.396 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: DMT.

00:46:17.396 --> 00:46:18.000 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And Rick's hypothesis,
together with others,

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:24.170 align:middle line:84%
is that the pineal gland
is able to produce,

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:29.090 align:middle line:84%
under certain conditions,
a surge of DMT.

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And that it is
this-- endogenous,

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:36.640 align:middle line:84%
meaning it's produced
in the human body--

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:44.000 align:middle line:84%
is able to act as the medium
that now interconnects

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.010 align:middle line:84%
interfaces-- my humanity
with my higher-dimensional

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:50.140 align:middle line:90%
spirituality.

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:54.920 align:middle line:84%
It acts as the living
physiological vortex.

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And thus Rick coined this
term, which is gorgeous,

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:01.557 align:middle line:90%
the "spirit molecule."

00:47:01.557 --> 00:47:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: Spirit from
above, molecule from below.

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Joel, let me ask
you a couple questions here.

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:10.525 align:middle line:84%
One thing that when
I was researching

00:47:10.525 --> 00:47:14.060 align:middle line:84%
and I found interesting
was that in Hebrew there

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:16.900 align:middle line:84%
is the word "peniel"
rather than "pineal,"

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:20.609 align:middle line:84%
but still only one letter
apart, meaning "Face of God."

00:47:20.609 --> 00:47:21.900 align:middle line:90%
Now, how does that interface--?

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes.

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:23.468 align:middle line:84%
You took the words
out of my mouth.

00:47:23.468 --> 00:47:24.899 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:47:24.899 --> 00:47:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: You took the DMT
out of my pineal gland.

00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:27.481 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:47:27.481 --> 00:47:28.060 align:middle line:90%
So let's--

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: OK.

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:33.250 align:middle line:84%
So here, and this is the
thing that really struck me.

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:35.710 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland,
we know, as you

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:37.300 align:middle line:84%
mentioned in your
introduction, it

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:40.770 align:middle line:84%
was coined about 300 years ago
based upon the word "pine cone"

00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:42.510 align:middle line:90%
because it's pine cone-like.

00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:45.040 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very small--
size of a grain of rice.

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: And the term in
Hebrew, "peniel" or "pineal,"

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:58.770 align:middle line:84%
both are correct pronunciations,
literally means "Face of God."

00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:01.980 align:middle line:84%
One of the other names,
the appellations,

00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:05.210 align:middle line:84%
for the Foundation
Stone, is peniel.

00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:10.170 align:middle line:84%
So now we're starting to see
kind of the cross-section--

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:10.829 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes.

00:48:10.829 --> 00:48:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the blending
of the two, as you

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:13.820 align:middle line:90%
spoke about a moment ago.

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk a little
bit more about it.

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:18.370 align:middle line:84%
First of all, have
you taken DMT?

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: No.

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You haven't.

00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:20.260 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: And I want to emphasize
that all my research and all

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:32.180 align:middle line:84%
my conclusions are based
upon the assumption

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:35.960 align:middle line:84%
that the pineal gland
produces endogenous DMT.

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And that can be generated
through one's own consciousness

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:45.800 align:middle line:84%
through meditative
practices, which

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:50.010 align:middle line:84%
I have taken bits and
pieces here and there

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:52.700 align:middle line:84%
from the Kabbalah
tradition, which, again,

00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:54.900 align:middle line:90%
is based on the written Torah.

00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And I have
reconstructed a whole,

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:03.930 align:middle line:84%
in effect, how to turn your
brain into a laboratory

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:07.630 align:middle line:84%
to produce your
own endogenous DMT.

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is how it's
done, very, very simply.

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:14.890 align:middle line:84%
It's done through
resonance, harmonics.

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Once we can accept the premise,
just as a working model, that

00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:25.760 align:middle line:84%
as my pineal gland
is to my body,

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:29.450 align:middle line:84%
this strange,
mysterious location

00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:34.940 align:middle line:84%
called the Foundation Stone
is to all of humanity.

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So if I get my pineal,
say, vibrating,

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:43.400 align:middle line:84%
and I direct my consciousness
to the place where

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.610 align:middle line:84%
the Holy of Holies stood,
which is now currently

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:48.080 align:middle line:84%
under the golden Dome
of the Rock-- rock?

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:48.650 align:middle line:90%
Which rock?

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:52.110 align:middle line:10%
That is the Foundation Stone,
but no one thinks about it.

00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:53.360 align:middle line:90%
Why did they build that there?

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a massive
contention on the planet, yes.

00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: Which brings the
point home even more so.

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Why is there so much contention?

00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Just as a sidebar, the
whole Israeli, Arab,

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:11.757 align:middle line:84%
Palestinian disputes,
everything, it comes down to--

00:50:11.757 --> 00:50:13.215 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everyone
wants that spot.

00:50:13.215 --> 00:50:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: --who has the
ownership of that spot?

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:16.440 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everyone
wants the spot.

00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:18.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Exactly.

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so one might
argue it belongs to no one.

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:22.080 align:middle line:90%
That would be the best argument.

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:23.090 align:middle line:90%
It belongs to no one.

00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:24.360 align:middle line:90%
It belongs to the planet.

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: OK.

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:28.900 align:middle line:90%
But who shall we entrust that--

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:29.965 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: --responsibility?

00:50:29.965 --> 00:50:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's going to
be a debate for-- who knows

00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:33.500 align:middle line:90%
how long that debate goes on?

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: But we do know that
there is an unbroken tradition,

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:42.020 align:middle line:84%
as I said, going back to--
there was a Jewish temple there

00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:43.440 align:middle line:90%
for 420 years.

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.690 align:middle line:90%
There was a break of 70 years.

00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Before that, it was Solomon's
Temple for 410 years.

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Before that, King
David purchased it.

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:51.800 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:53.100 align:middle line:90%
I get the complexities--

00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: --going
back to Abraham--

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:54.686 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --of the ownership.

00:50:54.686 --> 00:50:55.852 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: --OK, and so forth.

00:50:55.852 --> 00:50:57.830 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:01.930 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to emphasize
that this spiritual discussion

00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:08.650 align:middle line:84%
here sets up the basis
to understand geopolitics

00:51:08.650 --> 00:51:11.252 align:middle line:84%
from a cosmic perspective,
which is a whole--

00:51:11.252 --> 00:51:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is true.

00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:13.999 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: --different
game-changer.

00:51:13.999 --> 00:51:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: Because the
truth is, geopolitics,

00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:20.460 align:middle line:84%
it's no less spiritual
than anything else

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:23.170 align:middle line:84%
because it's cosmic in
its origins of what's

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:25.320 align:middle line:90%
taking place here.

00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So as I mentioned,
the prophets, in order

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:35.260 align:middle line:84%
to enter into a state
of prophecy, which

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:38.996 align:middle line:84%
is much more about
predicting the future,

00:51:38.996 --> 00:51:40.620 align:middle line:84%
it's an altered state
of consciousness.

00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And it would be, in
very, very loose terms,

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:45.660 align:middle line:84%
it's the Torah-- Jewish
equivalent to satori

00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and nirvana and enlightenment
and cosmic consciousness

00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:50.080 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:54.130 align:middle line:84%
So by aligning
myself, my pineal,

00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:57.940 align:middle line:84%
with the temple pineal
at the Foundation Stone,

00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.030 align:middle line:90%
now what have I got here?

00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:01.350 align:middle line:84%
I got the general
and the particular.

00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:03.730 align:middle line:84%
I've got the outer
and the inner.

00:52:03.730 --> 00:52:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And they are now working
together in union.

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:11.590 align:middle line:90%
Now here, just imagine this.

00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:16.540 align:middle line:84%
What if we had hundreds,
thousands of people meditating

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:19.290 align:middle line:84%
on their pineal gland while
simultaneously projecting

00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:23.930 align:middle line:84%
themselves astrally or
whatever to that very

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:26.940 align:middle line:84%
same location-- and let's
just assume that this

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:29.480 align:middle line:84%
is the equivalent
of the peniel, Face

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:36.030 align:middle line:84%
of God, pineal gland of
the planet, of humanity--

00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:38.130 align:middle line:84%
the power that can be
unleashed for peace?

00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's really
the point of your work.

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:41.382 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes, exactly.

00:52:41.382 --> 00:52:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, that
is why all of this

00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:44.798 align:middle line:84%
is being brought to
the table, and you've

00:52:44.798 --> 00:52:46.050 align:middle line:90%
put these pieces together.

00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:46.591 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes.

00:52:46.591 --> 00:52:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not that we
all need to start doing DMT--

00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:49.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: No.

00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and having that,
whatever, 15-minute experience

00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:54.550 align:middle line:84%
but to have it
organically connected

00:52:54.550 --> 00:52:55.950 align:middle line:90%
to something for purpose.

00:52:55.950 --> 00:52:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes.

00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:00.400 align:middle line:84%
For those that have experienced
DMT or ayahuasca, whatever,

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:05.230 align:middle line:84%
they can use that
experience as a model

00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:13.599 align:middle line:84%
to jump-start, to turbo-charge
this mode of global evolution.

00:53:13.599 --> 00:53:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is searching for,
and we're desperate now more

00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:19.560 align:middle line:84%
than ever, for some peace,
for some common language,

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:20.634 align:middle line:90%
some commonality.

00:53:20.634 --> 00:53:21.560 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:23.580 align:middle line:84%
There really already
is a common place.

00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned,
historically,

00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:27.881 align:middle line:84%
for better or for
worse, all the horrors--

00:53:27.881 --> 00:53:29.922 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The least peaceful
place on the planet.

00:53:29.922 --> 00:53:30.463 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes.

00:53:30.463 --> 00:53:33.512 align:middle line:84%
But that isn't certain-- in
one sense, the last place

00:53:33.512 --> 00:53:34.470 align:middle line:90%
we would think to look.

00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:35.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: That's
where it's hiding.

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's perhaps why

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:39.540 align:middle line:84%
it's the least peaceful
place on the planet

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:40.499 align:middle line:90%
is that very conflict.

00:53:40.499 --> 00:53:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Precisely.

00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:44.430 align:middle line:84%
But I would add,
it can be turned

00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:48.790 align:middle line:84%
inside out because all
the energy is there,

00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:51.590 align:middle line:84%
but it's not being
channeled in focus.

00:53:51.590 --> 00:53:54.616 align:middle line:84%
Therefore it manifests
through its own backside--

00:53:54.616 --> 00:53:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: --and thus
causing all of this chaos

00:53:59.180 --> 00:53:59.950 align:middle line:90%
and these horrors.

00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:01.950 align:middle line:84%
It's the lower realms
of consciousness

00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:03.055 align:middle line:90%
that are in the quarrel--

00:54:03.055 --> 00:54:03.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Right.

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.055 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --not
the upper realms.

00:54:05.055 --> 00:54:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Right.

00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And anyone can do this mode
of meditation, which I detail

00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:11.926 align:middle line:90%
in my book in more details.

00:54:11.926 --> 00:54:14.383 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you you talk
about it a little bit, just kind

00:54:14.383 --> 00:54:16.527 align:middle line:84%
of give us a little
hint of what it entails?

00:54:16.527 --> 00:54:17.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Sure.

00:54:17.110 --> 00:54:20.710 align:middle line:90%
This is, for example, what I do.

00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:24.620 align:middle line:84%
I simply go into
my pineal gland.

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:25.940 align:middle line:90%
I close my eyes.

00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:30.520 align:middle line:84%
I locate within my
own head essentially,

00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:31.470 align:middle line:90%
the very, very center.

00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:35.680 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the unique
qualities of the pineal gland.

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:38.460 align:middle line:84%
It's located right in
the middle of the brain.

00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:42.110 align:middle line:84%
I also want to mention
something that's astounding,

00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and that is the pineal
gland is the only organ

00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:49.660 align:middle line:90%
in the brain that is singular.

00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:53.130 align:middle line:84%
Every other organ is dual in
nature-- the two hemispheres.

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, paired.

00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: That's bizarre.

00:54:58.260 --> 00:54:58.920 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:54:58.920 --> 00:54:59.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:59.420 --> 00:54:59.760 align:middle line:90%
So here--

00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.685 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That point
of singularity.

00:55:00.685 --> 00:55:02.018 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: That point singularity.

00:55:02.018 --> 00:55:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That portal.

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: OK.

00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Let's flash back to Garden
of Eden, tree of knowledge,

00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:08.990 align:middle line:90%
tree of life.

00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:11.490 align:middle line:84%
The tree of knowledge of good
and evil is not good and evil.

00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:17.110 align:middle line:84%
It's about the tree of-- when
we say tree, think of dendrite,

00:55:17.110 --> 00:55:21.830 align:middle line:84%
think of circuits, think of
networks, internet, of duality.

00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:23.770 align:middle line:90%
It's binary.

00:55:23.770 --> 00:55:26.500 align:middle line:84%
The tree of life, and
this is very little known,

00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:28.490 align:middle line:84%
but this is an
absolute Torah fact.

00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:31.090 align:middle line:84%
The tree of life and the tree
of knowledge are the same tree.

00:55:31.090 --> 00:55:33.260 align:middle line:84%
The tree of life
is the root of it.

00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:37.260 align:middle line:84%
It branches into the
tree of knowledge.

00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:39.980 align:middle line:84%
According to this,
the pineal gland

00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:48.230 align:middle line:84%
is nothing less than a remnant
of the higher-dimensional tree

00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:51.530 align:middle line:84%
of life that still exists
within each one of us.

00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:54.360 align:middle line:84%
That's why it is
singular in its nature.

00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's why even though it
says Adam and Eve were expelled

00:55:57.550 --> 00:56:01.110 align:middle line:84%
from the Garden, but
in truth it was still

00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:04.820 align:middle line:84%
left open [HEBREW SPEECH],
the way, the path,

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:07.960 align:middle line:84%
the tree of life
for those that know

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:11.150 align:middle line:90%
how to get back into it again.

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And the way in, according to
the whole scenario that I'm

00:56:18.050 --> 00:56:20.540 align:middle line:90%
presenting, is we can go back.

00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:21.690 align:middle line:90%
We must go back.

00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And strangely
enough, the entrance

00:56:23.810 --> 00:56:27.850 align:middle line:84%
is right inside
of each one of us.

00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:31.530 align:middle line:84%
But specifically, we have to
align it with the collective.

00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:33.490 align:middle line:90%
We are a collective.

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:37.140 align:middle line:84%
We talk about all one
family, one humanity.

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:41.655 align:middle line:84%
Well, then why not there be
one singular pineal gland,

00:56:41.655 --> 00:56:44.560 align:middle line:84%
peniel, Face of God,
for all humanity,

00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:47.940 align:middle line:84%
and thus by doing this,
creating this resonance?

00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:53.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, more specifically,
what I do is I simply use

00:56:53.050 --> 00:56:57.090 align:middle line:84%
my power of imagination
that I am going in

00:56:57.090 --> 00:56:58.869 align:middle line:90%
between the two cherubim.

00:56:58.869 --> 00:56:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:04.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: My Ark of the
Covenant is inside my brain.

00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And in effect, that's all I
have to do and buckle myself in.

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And if I keep the
resonance going,

00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:14.950 align:middle line:84%
then the power of
the collective,

00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:18.840 align:middle line:84%
the power that is innate in
the geographical pineal gland,

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:23.610 align:middle line:84%
is going to affect and turn
on my personal pineal gland.

00:57:23.610 --> 00:57:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And vice versa-- my little
pineal gland, the little me,

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:32.830 align:middle line:84%
I can start having effect on
the collective of humanity.

00:57:32.830 --> 00:57:35.867 align:middle line:90%


00:57:35.867 --> 00:57:36.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:36.450 --> 00:57:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And if we were so lucky
as to actually employ

00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:49.070 align:middle line:84%
the notion of where two or more
gather, where you literally

00:57:49.070 --> 00:57:53.700 align:middle line:84%
have people in the same vision,
in the same understanding,

00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:56.140 align:middle line:84%
the same intention at the
same time, which almost

00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:59.300 align:middle line:84%
never happens, then
I think the power

00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:02.669 align:middle line:90%
for healing-- it's profound.

00:58:02.669 --> 00:58:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes.

00:58:03.210 --> 00:58:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're doing
your part one at a time.

00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:06.320 align:middle line:84%
You're teaching
people this concept.

00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:09.020 align:middle line:84%
You're teaching them to do
it one person at a time.

00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And every now and then,
and just recently,

00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:15.050 align:middle line:84%
I'll have one of our amazing
viewers write in and say,

00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:18.295 align:middle line:84%
why aren't we doing
something together?

00:58:18.295 --> 00:58:20.790 align:middle line:84%
A being that I have great
respect for and have

00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:23.200 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of guidance
from through my lifetime

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:26.800 align:middle line:84%
has said that is the one thing
that humanity has yet to do.

00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:30.270 align:middle line:84%
You gather together, each
one in their own thoughts,

00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:32.410 align:middle line:84%
saying they're meditating
for the same thing

00:58:32.410 --> 00:58:34.970 align:middle line:84%
with their own taste, their
own vision, their own feeling,

00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:36.370 align:middle line:90%
their own distractions.

00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's that
singularity of thought

00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:41.660 align:middle line:84%
coming together
perfectly that actually

00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:43.830 align:middle line:90%
drives very rapid change.

00:58:43.830 --> 00:58:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes.

00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:45.794 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
we're not doing it.

00:58:45.794 --> 00:58:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes.

00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And what is also unique about
this mode of pineal or luz

00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:57.310 align:middle line:84%
meditation is anyone can take
their practice-- Buddhist,

00:58:57.310 --> 00:58:57.810 align:middle line:90%
Sufi--

00:58:57.810 --> 00:58:58.685 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:58:58.685 --> 00:59:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: --Christian, all you
do, all we're adding on here

00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:05.530 align:middle line:84%
is you enter, you do what
you do inside of your pineal.

00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And then put your pineal inside
of the geographical pineal,

00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:12.870 align:middle line:90%
and now we have a commonality.

00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:16.326 align:middle line:90%
We have a common language.

00:59:16.326 --> 00:59:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And the circuitry
is already there.

00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:20.360 align:middle line:90%
The meridians are there.

00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:23.710 align:middle line:84%
They're built into the
structure of our planet

00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:26.250 align:middle line:90%
and into our humanity.

00:59:26.250 --> 00:59:33.224 align:middle line:84%
And once again, the whole world
has its eye on that space.

00:59:33.224 --> 00:59:34.890 align:middle line:84%
The problem is they
have their two eyes.

00:59:34.890 --> 00:59:37.269 align:middle line:84%
They need to put their
third eye on that space.

00:59:37.269 --> 00:59:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:59:38.310 --> 00:59:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: And now we have--

00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:41.138 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's needs to
be lifted into a higher

00:59:41.138 --> 00:59:42.380 align:middle line:90%
conversation no doubt.

00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: We have
now a mechanism.

00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:51.640 align:middle line:84%
We have something that who
could disagree, really,

00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:52.595 align:middle line:90%
with it in principle?

00:59:52.595 --> 00:59:53.178 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:59:53.178 --> 00:59:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, and we're out of
time, believe it or not.

00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: Now, I
just quickly add.

00:59:57.650 --> 00:59:59.820 align:middle line:84%
I rediscovered from the
Torah, from the Kabbalah,

00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:02.420 align:middle line:84%
there's a secret entrance
into the pineal gland,

01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:06.210 align:middle line:84%
not through the face,
through the forehead

01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:07.640 align:middle line:84%
but through the
back of the head.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: That's the occiput--

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:11.496 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: --which is the
secret, what the sages refer

01:00:11.496 --> 01:00:14.580 align:middle line:84%
to as the luz bone, which
corresponds anatomically

01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:18.040 align:middle line:84%
to the atlas, but
it's that whole area.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.800 align:middle line:90%
There's a secret entrance.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.530 align:middle line:10%
That goes back to the
cave and the tunnel that's

01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:24.590 align:middle line:10%
covered by the
luz tree, which is

01:00:24.590 --> 01:00:26.150 align:middle line:10%
the hair on the
back of the head.

01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:29.690 align:middle line:10%
You can go in, walk up the
stairs to the Holy of Holies.

01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:32.356 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Et voila, you're home.

01:00:32.356 --> 01:00:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: And don't
forget, you've

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:35.080 align:middle line:90%
got male and female there.

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:39.680 align:middle line:84%
So it requires passion, and
it requires love together

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.540 align:middle line:84%
with everything else
that we've spoken about.

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:46.290 align:middle line:84%
This has been a really
interesting journey with you.

01:00:46.290 --> 01:00:46.839 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:00:46.839 --> 01:00:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: Well, it's
been my pleasure.

01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:51.489 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And again,
the name of the book.

01:00:51.489 --> 01:00:53.780 align:middle line:84%
I have your site here, but
what is the name of the book

01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:54.175 align:middle line:90%
you've written?

01:00:54.175 --> 01:00:54.758 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yeah.

01:00:54.758 --> 01:00:57.410 align:middle line:84%
The name of the book
is "The Jerusalem Stone

01:00:57.410 --> 01:00:59.327 align:middle line:90%
of Consciousness."

01:00:59.327 --> 01:01:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: I also
have another book,

01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:04.690 align:middle line:84%
which is basically a manual on
how to study the methodology.

01:01:04.690 --> 01:01:06.189 align:middle line:90%
It's called "Beyond Kabbalah--"

01:01:06.189 --> 01:01:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BAKST: --"The Teachings
That Cannot be Taught."

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is
all on your website--

01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Yes.

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --available
through the website?

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: That is correct.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:12.966 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you so much.

01:01:12.966 --> 01:01:15.630 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate your time and
putting all these pieces

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:16.929 align:middle line:90%
together.

01:01:16.929 --> 01:01:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BAKST: Thank you.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.470 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To learn
more about Joel's work,
