00:00:08.582 --> 00:00:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>KAEDRICH OLSEN:
All of the people

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.570 align:middle line:84%
in the new agey
spiritual communities

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.403 align:middle line:84%
are talking about
lightworkers and I'm like,

00:00:13.403 --> 00:00:14.460 align:middle line:90%
no, I'm a shadow worker.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we have
paranormal attachments

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.190 align:middle line:84%
that give us a feeling
that we can't describe.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.705 align:middle line:84%
And that's a critical
part of shadow work.

00:00:22.705 --> 00:00:25.160 align:middle line:84%
In the acute moment
you can pair your anger

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.910 align:middle line:84%
coming from the brainstem with
the prefrontal cortex, which

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.610 align:middle line:84%
is connected to higher
self, to use that anger

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.858 align:middle line:90%
energy in a very positive way.

00:00:33.858 --> 00:00:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Oh, just throw more peace,
love, and light at it.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.860 align:middle line:90%
Call on the angels.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.670 align:middle line:90%
It'll go away.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's like--

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: That
is not necessarily true.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.183 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:00:41.183 --> 00:00:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about our dark secrets

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.675 align:middle line:90%
that we keep from ourselves.

00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:47.930 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.720 align:middle line:10%


00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.910 align:middle line:10%
I think it's fair
to say that everyone

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.190 align:middle line:10%
would prefer to see
themselves as a worker

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.420 align:middle line:10%
on the side of light.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.990 align:middle line:84%
But Kaedrich Olsen says this
is only half of our story.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.520 align:middle line:84%
He calls himself
a shadow worker,

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.150 align:middle line:84%
because like it or not, we each
have a shadow that influences

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.040 align:middle line:90%
our own conscious behavior.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.525 align:middle line:90%
Not me, Kaedrich?

00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:10.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.060 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Of course, not.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not me.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.430 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.811 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: We all do.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.250 align:middle line:90%
One way or another we all do.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.875 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I mean it's that
pesky little subconscious just

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:21.510 align:middle line:84%
poking through all the time
whether we like it or not.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And I had a very
interesting discussion--

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.300 align:middle line:84%
before we launch in--
with someone recently

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.360 align:middle line:84%
about the subconscious
mind, about emotion

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.480 align:middle line:84%
versus feeling, and talking
about emotion as a chemical

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.280 align:middle line:90%
response.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.765 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Being driven from
our survival mechanism,

00:01:36.765 --> 00:01:38.210 align:middle line:84%
coming from the
subconscious mind.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And that can have a
lot of dark stuff in it

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.110 align:middle line:84%
because we've been through
a lot of dark stuff, right?

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.640 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So give
your own impression

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.850 align:middle line:84%
of where that stuff's
coming from before we

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.140 align:middle line:90%
get into the rest of the story.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.590 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's good to differentiate
emotion from feeling.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.778 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: Because,
really, the way I

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:56.630 align:middle line:10%
look at it, information,
energy, emotion and feelings,

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.140 align:middle line:10%
they're all the same thing.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.810 align:middle line:90%
They're just variations upon it.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, the
emotions are in the body.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.920 align:middle line:90%
There's a biochemistry going on.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.420 align:middle line:84%
Every emotion has
a chemistry to it.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.991 align:middle line:84%
But there's sometimes feelings
that we don't have words to.

00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:10.699 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
much more ephemeral.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.370 align:middle line:84%
You don't feel things
squirting out through your body

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.870 align:middle line:84%
and freaking you
out or you know.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's different.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.690 align:middle line:10%
>>OLSEN: And in the
realm that I work with

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.810 align:middle line:10%
or the paranormal
and the shadow stuff,

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.000 align:middle line:10%
sometimes we have
paranormal attachments

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.800 align:middle line:10%
that give us a feeling
that we can't describe.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And that feeling can then
elicit certain emotions.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.200 align:middle line:84%
So it really comes to being
aware of, what am I feeling?

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.270 align:middle line:90%
What am I experiencing?

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.230 align:middle line:84%
What is this emotion
that's going on?

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you can put a
word to it, that's great.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.133 align:middle line:84%
If you can't, that's
OK, too, as long

00:02:38.133 --> 00:02:39.800 align:middle line:84%
as you're aware of
the experience of it.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's a critical
part of shadow work

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.895 align:middle line:84%
is being able to feel
it and be aware of it.

00:02:44.895 --> 00:02:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So why did you decide
to call yourself a shadow

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.960 align:middle line:84%
worker, because you
decided you're just-- oh,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.150 align:middle line:90%
just come out and say it.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm a shadow worker.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:84%
But that's because it's
taking people to light.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.950 align:middle line:90%
You tell us.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.380 align:middle line:90%
It started off tongue-in-cheek.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.060 align:middle line:84%
But then, again,
that's sometimes

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.910 align:middle line:90%
how my psychic abilities work.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed when I
was a kid I would just

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.330 align:middle line:84%
say this weird off-the-cuff
thing that just meant nothing

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.870 align:middle line:84%
to me, but their eyes would go
big and their jaw would drop.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I used to just
play around with that.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.592 align:middle line:84%
And because I was
doing shadow work,

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:15.050 align:middle line:84%
and all of the people in the
new agey spiritual communities

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.925 align:middle line:84%
are talking about
lightworkers, and I'm like,

00:03:16.925 --> 00:03:17.970 align:middle line:90%
no, I'm a shadow worker.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:18.770 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Because I work on the dark side
of spirituality to help people

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.430 align:middle line:90%
find their light.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And it started off kind of
just tongue-in-cheek humorous.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.148 align:middle line:84%
And then I went, wait a minute,
there's some truth to this.

00:03:28.148 --> 00:03:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, OK,
let's stick with it

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.510 align:middle line:84%
and follow through with it,
because I think that was just

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.290 align:middle line:84%
my higher being speaking
through me in a way

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:84%
that the ego wasn't
getting attached to it

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.900 align:middle line:84%
and double-guessing
and second-guessing

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.935 align:middle line:90%
everything I was doing.

00:03:39.935 --> 00:03:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and you
are-- you're psychic.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.690 align:middle line:84%
You were raised in that
environment to foster that.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.130 align:middle line:84%
You're also a very
sensitive person.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And as we were just talking
a little bit ago off camera,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.220 align:middle line:90%
you're a caregiver by nature.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.980 align:middle line:84%
So you're an interesting
person that's

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.290 align:middle line:84%
taken this on because
of your own sensitivity.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.120 align:middle line:84%
A lot of time sensitives want
to stay as far away from shadow

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.890 align:middle line:90%
and darkness as possible.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.990 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little
bit about yourself

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.990 align:middle line:84%
and why you decided to
go headlong into it.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.110 align:middle line:84%
It's because of the years
of working with people

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.730 align:middle line:84%
and helping people with
their spiritual growth

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.110 align:middle line:90%
and their spiritual development.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.200 align:middle line:84%
I kept seeing the same
blocks, the same patterns

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.720 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, what's
going on here?

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it would
be like angry.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.320 align:middle line:84%
They say, OK, I need to be this
spiritual, highly enlightened

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.080 align:middle line:84%
person, but yet I still
get angry about this

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.280 align:middle line:90%
and I get angry about that.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.488 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, I'm not really
doing my spiritual work.

00:04:33.488 --> 00:04:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And I went, doesn't
make sense here.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
digging into that.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, wait a minute,
the anger is not the shadow.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.020 align:middle line:84%
The fear of expressing
your anger, the inability

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:84%
to express it or even
thinking that you're not

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.900 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual person because you
have anger is the shadow stuff.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.027 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's raw
truth in an angry response.

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, we don't want
to live there and have it

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.930 align:middle line:90%
toxify our whole bloodstream.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Correct.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: However, I
think it's certainly

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.250 align:middle line:84%
a good indication
there's something

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.952 align:middle line:90%
that needs to be looked at.

00:05:05.952 --> 00:05:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And in an acute
moment, when something

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.990 align:middle line:84%
needs to be dealt with here and
now, needs something to happen,

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.780 align:middle line:84%
you can pair your anger
coming from the brainstem

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.960 align:middle line:84%
with the prefrontal cortex,
which is your higher executive

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.120 align:middle line:84%
functioning which is
connected to higher self,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.300 align:middle line:84%
to use that anger energy
in a very positive way,

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.450 align:middle line:84%
in a very good outcome in a
way that actually helps boost

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.070 align:middle line:90%
your spiritual growth.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.030 align:middle line:90%
And I realized that.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.860 align:middle line:90%
I saw that over and over again.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.510 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
thinking they don't

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.390 align:middle line:84%
deserve these good things,
they don't deserve that.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.800 align:middle line:90%
They're holding themselves back.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Or in the paranormal
world, negative paranormal

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.490 align:middle line:84%
interactions happening, thought
forms, bad juju in the house.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.470 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to do
manifestation work

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.550 align:middle line:90%
and it just falls apart.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.467 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing the same
patterns and I'm like, OK,

00:05:48.467 --> 00:05:50.940 align:middle line:84%
we need to get to the
root of what this is.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I saw the typical
place of working was like,

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.570 align:middle line:84%
oh, just throw more peace,
love, and light at it,

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.105 align:middle line:84%
just be moving to
your higher self

00:05:59.105 --> 00:06:01.230 align:middle line:84%
and take the peace, love,
and light of higher self,

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.122 align:middle line:84%
call on the angels,
it'll go away.

00:06:03.122 --> 00:06:04.080 align:middle line:90%
Just work through that.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.880 align:middle line:90%
And it's like--

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: My observation is
that is not necessarily true.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.210 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I came across
the crazy notion

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.190 align:middle line:84%
of why don't you just
make friends with it?

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you look at these
things that are blocking you,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.820 align:middle line:84%
look at that anger, look at that
self-deprecating belief that's

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.200 align:middle line:90%
inside your mind.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.670 align:middle line:90%
Make friends with it.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.110 align:middle line:90%
Learn where it came from.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.463 align:middle line:84%
Learn how it actually is helping
you and how it did help you.

00:06:28.463 --> 00:06:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
because when

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.550 align:middle line:84%
I see people fighting shadows
and they go head to head,

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.040 align:middle line:84%
that shadow locks in deeper
and darker and harder.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.800 align:middle line:84%
But when they sit back and they
go, OK, tell me about yourself.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.600 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.830 align:middle line:90%
Why are you here?

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.180 align:middle line:90%
And they feel genuine gratitude.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.448 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, that's
what you're all about.

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:47.990 align:middle line:84%
That's what those
thoughts are about.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.640 align:middle line:90%
That's where they came from.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.590 align:middle line:84%
That's how you helped
me at that time.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.400 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.400 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's that realization.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, the pattern's
broken, the block is gone.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.287 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, wait,
what just happened?

00:06:58.287 --> 00:07:00.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, you made
friends with your shadow,

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.600 align:middle line:84%
and you realized how
it was helping you,

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.558 align:middle line:84%
and what the benefit to
that dark side that you

00:07:03.558 --> 00:07:05.378 align:middle line:90%
were hiding all the time was.

00:07:05.378 --> 00:07:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Now you don't have to
deal with it anymore.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: It's gone.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.010 align:middle line:90%
It's easy to work with.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.177 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And what a relief.

00:07:10.177 --> 00:07:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to
say, in that sense,

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.190 align:middle line:84%
I am a bit out of
my element in this

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:20.530 align:middle line:84%
because I don't even
have bad dreams.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.620 align:middle line:84%
I almost never even
have a negative dream.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.400 align:middle line:84%
It's not that stuff
doesn't happen in life

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.690 align:middle line:90%
that you have to contend with.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.510 align:middle line:84%
You have to contend with
challenging things in life.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.400 align:middle line:90%
But I don't really know--

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I know
the face of darkness

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.630 align:middle line:84%
at this point in my
evolution all that well.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.230 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
speaking to me, you're

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.100 align:middle line:84%
really informing me
about how it works,

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:84%
because I'm dealing with
some situations in which it's

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.750 align:middle line:90%
very present.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really
understand it all that well.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's just not
my job this time around.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:54.740 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.870 align:middle line:84%
On one level, it's
just not my job.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.890 align:middle line:84%
So for me, you're actually
talking to a little bit--

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:03.490 align:middle line:84%
certainly, a neophyte
at the very best.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, one thing
that I'm wondering about,

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.670 align:middle line:84%
because I've had a conversation
with Jan Engels-Smith recently.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.680 align:middle line:84%
She's a psychologist,
does shamanic work.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And she's saying that she's
seeing an increase in what you

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.480 align:middle line:84%
would call spells that people
are having over one another

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.630 align:middle line:84%
or even casting consciously
over one another.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.387 align:middle line:84%
What is your own experience
in this area, before we go on?

00:08:26.387 --> 00:08:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.890 align:middle line:84%
I do have a background in the
Norse stuff and the runes--

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:30.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --and esoteric
and studying the occult--

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:33.159 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:34.534 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --and
getting into that.

00:08:34.534 --> 00:08:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And I realized
it's just an effect

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.580 align:middle line:84%
at the collective
unconscious level

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.970 align:middle line:84%
that we're inserting information
into the unconscious that we

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:43.870 align:middle line:90%
all share.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And it might be related
to another person.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And because everything shares
resonance-- similarities

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.148 align:middle line:84%
attract and perpetuate--
if this information is

00:08:51.148 --> 00:08:52.690 align:middle line:84%
put into that
collective unconscious,

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:54.620 align:middle line:84%
this other person
will pick up on it.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And here's the key part--
they have an agreement to it.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.010 align:middle line:84%
That information gets put
out there and then they go--

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and I don't mean a
conscious logical,

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.973 align:middle line:84%
yes, you can have
this attachment to me,

00:09:04.973 --> 00:09:06.640 align:middle line:84%
but it's like a deeper,
emotional level.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you think on a
soul level, people have chosen--

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.850 align:middle line:84%
some people-- a
spectrum of society

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:15.850 align:middle line:84%
has chosen to
understand the dark more

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.070 align:middle line:84%
and engage more deeply with
it at this period in time?

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Definitely.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.685 align:middle line:84%
It's actually something that's
been around for a long time.

00:09:22.685 --> 00:09:24.310 align:middle line:84%
But because we weren't
dealing with it,

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.470 align:middle line:84%
because we were projecting
it onto other people,

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.720 align:middle line:84%
we were saying it's
your problem, not mine.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm upset about this or
I'm uncomfortable about that

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.030 align:middle line:84%
and it's your problem
that it's that way.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.928 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we're now
going, wait a minute,

00:09:35.928 --> 00:09:38.470 align:middle line:84%
what's making me uncomfortable
about the way these people are

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:39.130 align:middle line:90%
acting?

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.547 align:middle line:84%
What's making me uncomfortable
about what these people are

00:09:41.547 --> 00:09:42.400 align:middle line:90%
saying and doing?

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Because they're
doing what they feel is right,

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:46.160 align:middle line:90%
so why is it bothering me?

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why is it hurting you?

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:48.220 align:middle line:90%
Why is it making you mad?

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:48.505 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:49.305 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Mhm.

00:09:49.305 --> 00:09:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's where that
agreement comes in sometimes.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Let's say when we're a
child, we want something.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:57.980 align:middle line:90%
We want-- whatever it is.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Mom and dad goes, ugh,
what do you think,

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:00.690 align:middle line:90%
money grows on trees?

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:01.490 align:middle line:90%
You can't have that.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.948 align:middle line:84%
We're not the kind of people
that get these sort of things.

00:10:03.948 --> 00:10:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Or you've been a
bad boy, a bad girl,

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.270 align:middle line:84%
you don't deserve to
have this sort of thing.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.160 align:middle line:84%
That's a program
running in our mind.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.808 align:middle line:84%
Now, somebody cast that
spell out there that says,

00:10:12.808 --> 00:10:14.600 align:middle line:84%
well, you're going to
be in abject poverty.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.250 align:middle line:84%
This agreement comes
and goes, well,

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.850 align:middle line:84%
yeah, because I've
been a bad person.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't deserve to have that.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.450 align:middle line:84%
So they attach and they agree
to have that spell of poverty

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.050 align:middle line:84%
that they took on to themselves
because they don't deserve it.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And then when we get
into the shadow work,

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.600 align:middle line:84%
we realize mom and dad were
saying that because they

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.975 align:middle line:84%
were frustrated
with their bills,

00:10:30.975 --> 00:10:32.870 align:middle line:90%
their own financial situation.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And that we can give
a different meaning

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.290 align:middle line:84%
to that experience
of childhood going,

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:38.373 align:middle line:84%
no, mom and dad were
actually trying to protect us

00:10:38.373 --> 00:10:39.831 align:middle line:84%
and trying to keep
the family safe.

00:10:39.831 --> 00:10:42.373 align:middle line:84%
And they were having a moment
of an outburst that they didn't

00:10:42.373 --> 00:10:44.000 align:middle line:84%
understand their own
emotional output,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.260 align:middle line:84%
but they were
trying to protect--

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.480 align:middle line:84%
and it had nothing to do
with me being a good person

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.950 align:middle line:90%
or bad person that deserved it.

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.738 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And with
that realization,

00:10:50.738 --> 00:10:51.680 align:middle line:90%
that agreement's gone.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Now that spell has no
effect because they're like,

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:55.970 align:middle line:90%
no, I don't need this anymore.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.990 align:middle line:90%
Very well stated.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.960 align:middle line:84%
So let's go on to the notion
of these darker secrets

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.760 align:middle line:90%
we keep from--

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:90%
maybe that's me.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'm just in denial
of all the dark stuff

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.500 align:middle line:90%
underneath there.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.130 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And I certainly
can bungle things up

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:11.630 align:middle line:90%
and make some stupid decision.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm perpetually
surprised by life.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.465 align:middle line:90%
So who knows what's in there.

00:11:15.465 --> 00:11:17.090 align:middle line:84%
I haven't done the
excavation you have.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.770 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
our dark secrets

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.768 align:middle line:90%
that we keep from ourselves.

00:11:21.768 --> 00:11:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: We all have them
in one form or another.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And the best way I can
describe it is when we're kids,

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.840 align:middle line:84%
our soul came into this world
to live a certain purpose,

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.490 align:middle line:84%
to have a certain function,
to be a certain way.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:34.070 align:middle line:84%
But when we grew
up in our families,

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.650 align:middle line:84%
we grew up in our communities,
societies around us,

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.590 align:middle line:84%
our friends, our schools,
churches, whatever.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:42.685 align:middle line:84%
They basically said, no, you
have to be believing this,

00:11:42.685 --> 00:11:44.060 align:middle line:84%
you have to be
thinking this, you

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.380 align:middle line:84%
have to be feeling that
and acting this way.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.480 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, there's
something wrong with you.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.933 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to shame you.

00:11:49.933 --> 00:11:51.350 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
shun you from here.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:52.700 align:middle line:90%
We're going to punish you.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And so we took on those traits
to adapt to that society

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:58.140 align:middle line:90%
we grew up in.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And we allowed
ourselves to create

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.630 align:middle line:84%
a facade of a fake
individual who we were.

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And this fake facade dictates
how reality works for us.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.140 align:middle line:84%
It tells us what
we're capable of,

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:10.790 align:middle line:84%
what we're competent
of achieving,

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.770 align:middle line:84%
what we deserve
and don't deserve.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And now we have this interaction
with this facade that

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:17.810 align:middle line:90%
guides us through our life.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.717 align:middle line:84%
And we think, well, that's
how the world works.

00:12:20.717 --> 00:12:22.550 align:middle line:84%
These kind of people
over there, well, there

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:23.610 align:middle line:90%
are always people like that.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And those people over
there doing that,

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:25.820 align:middle line:90%
they're always like that.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And, oh, can these
people keep doing that?

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And this person
says the same thing.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Those are all shadow things.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Even coming up to
another yellow light--

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:34.882 align:middle line:90%
oh, what is this?

00:12:34.882 --> 00:12:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.037 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] That's where
shadow comes up.

00:12:38.037 --> 00:12:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: They're all
shadows in there.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:40.495 align:middle line:90%
They're all patterns.

00:12:40.495 --> 00:12:41.295 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah,

00:12:41.295 --> 00:12:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And then we
start going, OK, I

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.390 align:middle line:84%
am getting to this
certain point.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.070 align:middle line:84%
I can make this
certain dollar amount.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.450 align:middle line:84%
I can make these kind of
relationships in my life.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:50.480 align:middle line:84%
But I can't get
to the next step.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.560 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Or why do all of my romantic
relationships in life

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.770 align:middle line:84%
have to be with the same type
of person over and over again?

00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:59.540 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's the shadow part.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Or what is this lesson that
I keep butting my head up

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.740 align:middle line:90%
against that I'm not getting?

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:04.980 align:middle line:90%
That's the shadow part.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: More heartbreaking
is maybe somebody--

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:10.910 align:middle line:84%
I see this with
guys, for example,

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.620 align:middle line:90%
with the men that I work with.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.860 align:middle line:84%
As they were a young
boy, they loved dancing.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.360 align:middle line:90%
They loved moving their body.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
and then they stop.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: They got
into that flow.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And then dad's like,
what are you doing?

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.440 align:middle line:90%
That's not what boys do.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what sissies do.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And now that's embedded
into their subconscious.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.558 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a shame.

00:13:26.558 --> 00:13:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And it's a talent,
it's a joy that they have.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.050 align:middle line:84%
They get into their mid-30s
and they're like, oh, dancing

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.220 align:middle line:84%
is sissy stuff,
it's girly stuff.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And then we start
doing shadow work

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:37.610 align:middle line:84%
because they start
hitting, like, why

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:40.610 align:middle line:84%
do I keep having these same
problems with my girlfriends,

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:43.400 align:middle line:84%
with my wife, with-- why do
I have these problems at work

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.450 align:middle line:90%
over and over?

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.845 align:middle line:84%
And then they start talking
about moving their body

00:13:46.845 --> 00:13:47.970 align:middle line:90%
and the flow of their body.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like,
let's explore that.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.540 align:middle line:90%
Well, no, that's not what we do.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And then we go into that
and we're like, oh, right,

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.610 align:middle line:90%
you do like dancing.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:57.080 align:middle line:90%
You do like that sense of flow.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.450 align:middle line:84%
You do like that emotion
that comes through.

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:02.278 align:middle line:84%
You do like having that
vulnerability and being open.

00:14:02.278 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And then they realize
that there's actually

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:05.060 align:middle line:90%
strength there.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.102 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, if they
want to really go for it,

00:14:07.102 --> 00:14:08.030 align:middle line:90%
do Argentine tango.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:09.020 align:middle line:90%
It's super macho.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.720 align:middle line:84%
It's led by the guy, but
you have to be in your body.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.100 align:middle line:90%
You have to really feel it.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And then they realized they
had this lost talent that was

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.590 align:middle line:90%
their whole life-- missing.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And they
didn't have this joy.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:20.940 align:middle line:90%
It was just gone.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And when they
finally are open up to it

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.520 align:middle line:84%
and like, wait, I
can still be a man.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.230 align:middle line:90%
I can still enjoy dancing.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And they go out and
they fulfill that dance.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, the
relationships click.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly workplace
problems are gone.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly prosperity
starts to increase.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.410 align:middle line:90%
It's like what's going on?

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.077 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It totally
changes everything.

00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Because for a lot of people,
we forget our inherent forms

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.370 align:middle line:84%
of communication that we
knew when we were young.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:44.930 align:middle line:90%
And that was a great example.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.220 align:middle line:90%
Mine was dancing.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.100 align:middle line:90%
And I was feeling really blue.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, after years,
I thought, what is missing?

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.330 align:middle line:90%
I went back to dancing.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.530 align:middle line:90%
My whole life shifted.

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Everything shifted when I
went back to that movement,

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:58.010 align:middle line:90%
to music.

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.720 align:middle line:90%
And so that's just one example.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.800 align:middle line:90%
Some people play music.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.710 align:middle line:90%
Some people use art.

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.720 align:middle line:90%
Some others use language.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:10.700 align:middle line:84%
But often we're denying our
innate, most basic sense

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.125 align:middle line:84%
of communication that we
knew when we were young.

00:15:13.125 --> 00:15:13.925 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:15:13.925 --> 00:15:14.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No good.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.350 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.058 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
why I see the parallel

00:15:17.058 --> 00:15:19.790 align:middle line:84%
between paranormal
working and shadow working

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.640 align:middle line:84%
is because when we're children,
our abilities are turned on.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.640 align:middle line:90%
We're open and aware.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:90%
We're connecting with spirits.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.223 align:middle line:90%
We can feel the energy patterns.

00:15:26.223 --> 00:15:27.023 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:27.023 --> 00:15:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: But because
mom and dad and teacher

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:31.190 align:middle line:84%
aren't acknowledging those,
we turn those things off.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Or if they start talking
about it, they're shut down.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.730 align:middle line:90%
They're laughed at.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I tell people the worst
part of a paranormal experience

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.230 align:middle line:84%
is talking about
it with somebody.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.640 align:middle line:90%
So they turn it off.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.960 align:middle line:90%
They tune it out.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:84%
But yet, as they go into
their life, life progresses.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.610 align:middle line:84%
They get a little flash
of the paranormal.

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:47.910 align:middle line:84%
They get this little
bit of awakening.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:49.020 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, what is it?

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:49.760 align:middle line:90%
They're afraid of it.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.593 align:middle line:84%
They're scared because
they were told, well,

00:15:51.593 --> 00:15:52.970 align:middle line:84%
it's not really
your grandmother.

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.137 align:middle line:84%
It's just a demon pretending
to be your grandmother.

00:15:55.137 --> 00:15:56.705 align:middle line:90%
It's like, it's not that.

00:15:56.705 --> 00:15:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And don't get the
Ouija board out

00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:59.990 align:middle line:90%
because that's a portal to hell.

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.835 align:middle line:90%
Let's let that go.

00:16:00.835 --> 00:16:01.635 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:01.635 --> 00:16:03.440 align:middle line:84%
So they start getting
these little flashes.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.460 align:middle line:90%
And they start opening up.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.627 align:middle line:90%
And they start exploring it.

00:16:05.627 --> 00:16:06.860 align:middle line:90%
And we do the shadow work.

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And because every paranormal
experience is co-creative

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.360 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly they
start realizing

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.360 align:middle line:84%
that the more they interact
with the paranormal,

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.210 align:middle line:84%
the safer it gets, the shadows
start to dissolve away.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And they realize, whoa, I had
these abilities my entire life.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And there aren't scary
demonic entities anywhere,

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.460 align:middle line:90%
ever have been.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.100 align:middle line:84%
That was just me projecting
my fears outside.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Now that they're
done, it's like, oh,

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.640 align:middle line:84%
this stuff is beautiful
and it's amazing.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not scary.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.790 align:middle line:90%
What's with all these movies?

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the downside
is now they go

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.560 align:middle line:84%
to watch a horror movie, that's,
like, a scary horror movie,

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.780 align:middle line:84%
and it's, like,
that's really dumb.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:42.860 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work that way.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:43.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It kind
of takes that away.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.860 align:middle line:90%
But the rest is better to have.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:46.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, so what
is the mechanism then?

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.460 align:middle line:90%
How does one go from--

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:56.150 align:middle line:84%
how do you begin excavating
the secrets you keep

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:middle line:90%
about your own dark shadows?

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.260 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: It's all
about awareness.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And for the most part, shadows
will project themselves.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:07.130 align:middle line:84%
They project themselves onto
other people, other situations.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:09.230 align:middle line:84%
If you see a
coworker or a friend

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:12.440 align:middle line:84%
have something successful happen
to them and you suddenly go--

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:12.728 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
don't like them.

00:17:12.728 --> 00:17:12.829 align:middle line:90%
You're jealous.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --oh, come
on, rah, rah, rah.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.869 align:middle line:84%
That's the shadow
saying, hey, here I am.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm ready to resolve this one
because you can do that, too.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.010 align:middle line:90%
And then we go, no, I can't.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Oh, hey, there's more
shadow for you to work with.

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.357 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And so you just
stop and you're like,

00:17:26.357 --> 00:17:29.180 align:middle line:84%
OK, wait a minute,
what is this feeling?

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.173 align:middle line:84%
And you just be aware
of that feeling.

00:17:31.173 --> 00:17:32.090 align:middle line:90%
And that's all you do.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:33.060 align:middle line:90%
You be aware of it.

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:33.950 align:middle line:90%
No judgment.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.420 align:middle line:90%
No criticism.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.860 align:middle line:90%
Just awareness.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So once
you're aware of it,

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.612 align:middle line:84%
then how does that
start transforming?

00:17:40.612 --> 00:17:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: You breathe
into that awareness.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.800 align:middle line:90%
You drop your awareness into it.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, what
are you all about?

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:46.910 align:middle line:84%
You literally have
a dialogue with it.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:47.710 align:middle line:90%
What are you about?

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why are you
angry because someone else

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:51.860 align:middle line:90%
has been elevated?

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And where did I
learn this, especially when

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:55.310 align:middle line:90%
did I learn this?

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Because if you get the awareness
of what the shadow is and you

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:00.505 align:middle line:84%
get the awareness of the
origin of that shadow,

00:18:00.505 --> 00:18:02.630 align:middle line:84%
you learn what it was all
about, what it was doing,

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and how it was helping you,
and then you're like, oh, God,

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.260 align:middle line:90%
thank you for that.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.190 align:middle line:90%
That's awesome.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Now I get what you were
protecting me from.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:10.900 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.550 align:middle line:90%
And usually that's all it takes.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:15.100 align:middle line:84%
90% of the time just
that level of awareness

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.810 align:middle line:84%
of what it is and
where it comes from,

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:20.950 align:middle line:84%
with no judgment but gratitude,
let's it suddenly go,

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:24.160 align:middle line:84%
well, maybe I can do
what my coworker did.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I have that
possibility, too.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Because if they did
it, I can do it, too.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.940 align:middle line:84%
I'll just do it in my own way
and I'll make it cool for me.

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.705 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And suddenly that
shadow is now your best friend

00:18:33.705 --> 00:18:35.650 align:middle line:84%
helping you with that
motivation to do it

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.675 align:middle line:84%
rather than preventing
you from doing it.

00:18:37.675 --> 00:18:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you also
help facilitate people

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:40.510 align:middle line:90%
through this process.

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.160 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, that's what you do.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And also, I'm thinking
of a tool that I

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.187 align:middle line:84%
have used when something
is bothering me

00:18:47.187 --> 00:18:48.270 align:middle line:90%
and I need to contemplate.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Do you know Richard Rudd and
the Gene Keys by any chance?

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: His book, "The
Art of Contemplation,"

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.930 align:middle line:90%
is what you're talking about.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:84%
About letting
yourself take the time

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.500 align:middle line:84%
to fall more and more
deeply into the feelings

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.660 align:middle line:84%
without judgment,
without hurrying it,

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.070 align:middle line:90%
without pushing it away.

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Very similar to what
you're talking about.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:10.540 align:middle line:90%
And I think these--

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.860 align:middle line:90%
they're not even techniques.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.730 align:middle line:84%
I think this practice
is really important now.

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Because now a lot of
shadows in all of us,

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.250 align:middle line:84%
in terms of these feelings
you're talking about,

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:22.708 align:middle line:84%
are starting to
rise up, where it's

00:19:22.708 --> 00:19:25.390 align:middle line:84%
like they're being squeezed
out of us at this period

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:26.542 align:middle line:90%
in history, right?

00:19:26.542 --> 00:19:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And I love calling
it a practice rather than

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:29.260 align:middle line:90%
a technique.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:29.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Because a
technique is just something

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.740 align:middle line:84%
you do once in a
while or whatnot.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.290 align:middle line:84%
But a practice can become
a spiritual practice.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:36.970 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
you do regularly.

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And this is the thing
I teach people about shadow work

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:41.440 align:middle line:90%
is it's skill building.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:41.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:43.627 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That once you
build up these skills--

00:19:43.627 --> 00:19:46.390 align:middle line:84%
let's say you are successful
in your shadow work

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.430 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly you get to
this baseline of what

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:49.810 align:middle line:90%
your life is like right now.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:50.810 align:middle line:90%
Shadows are cleared.

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:51.610 align:middle line:90%
Everything's great.

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.590 align:middle line:84%
You're doing great
and wonderful.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:57.430 align:middle line:84%
5-10 years pass
and who you are now

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.838 align:middle line:84%
might not work for
who you've become.

00:19:59.838 --> 00:20:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And so the stuff that's
working for you now

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle line:84%
and they're not shadows now
will become shadows for you

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.200 align:middle line:90%
in 5 to 10 years.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.890 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the skills, now
you can raise your baseline up

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:09.370 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that makes sense.

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:11.765 align:middle line:84%
I mean, truly,
why would you keep

00:20:11.765 --> 00:20:13.870 align:middle line:84%
incarnating if you
don't have shadow stuff,

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.700 align:middle line:84%
even if, like me,
you're not particularly

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.920 align:middle line:84%
introspective about it
[LAUGHS] and may not

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.120 align:middle line:90%
be aware of all of them.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:23.410 align:middle line:84%
But we wouldn't be
incarnating unless we

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:26.170 align:middle line:84%
have this that is looking
for transformation

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:30.220 align:middle line:84%
in this process of refinement
toward that ultimate feeling

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.070 align:middle line:84%
that we all are bathed
in all the time, which

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:34.340 align:middle line:90%
is loving consciousness.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.140 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
that's what we're

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.390 align:middle line:84%
trying to move
toward by releasing

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:39.192 align:middle line:90%
all of this in the end.

00:20:39.192 --> 00:20:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And I will even contend
that sometimes higher self

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:45.100 align:middle line:90%
comes here to experience this.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.430 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of the
work of Carolyn Elliott.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:52.180 align:middle line:84%
She talks about what if you
are this great universal cosmic

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.030 align:middle line:84%
being that could be
anything, anywhere, any time.

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.880 align:middle line:84%
You could experience
anything that you want to do.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.080 align:middle line:90%
But there's no conflict.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.070 align:middle line:90%
There's no turmoil.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you get a
little bit bored.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.965 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is this like going
to a horror movie for fun?

00:21:02.965 --> 00:21:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:04.750 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: So you said, OK, maybe
I want to come into this life

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.170 align:middle line:90%
and I want to experience this.

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:11.300 align:middle line:84%
I want to experience that and
I want to go through that.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you are at the
egoic level saying,

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.260 align:middle line:90%
no, that's got to stop.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:15.800 align:middle line:90%
We can't have it.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.900 align:middle line:84%
You can't have it
when the higher self

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.400 align:middle line:90%
isn't getting its fulfillment.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.670 align:middle line:84%
But if just for the
moment you can go,

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:25.540 align:middle line:84%
all right, I'll let you have
this, I'll let you do that,

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.890 align:middle line:84%
then maybe it goes away
because it's helped me develop

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:30.130 align:middle line:90%
a new model of higher self.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: What if you're
on a roller coaster--

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:36.420 align:middle line:84%
your day-to-day egoic self
is on a roller coaster.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And something terrible is
about to happen in your life.

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's coming to the peak
of that first hill of the roller

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.320 align:middle line:90%
coaster.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.400 align:middle line:90%
You know there's more to go.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.630 align:middle line:84%
But now you're
like, wait a minute,

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:46.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be here.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:47.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm not ready for this.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.113 align:middle line:90%
I can't handle this.

00:21:48.113 --> 00:21:49.110 align:middle line:90%
No, no, get me off.

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Nope, I'm not ready for this.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:50.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now, now, off.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.118 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Higher self,
meanwhile, is back at the dock,

00:21:53.118 --> 00:21:56.410 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of the ride
going, yeah, that was great.

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:57.210 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it again.

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:58.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:00.000 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Yeah, we have
to understand that we

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.530 align:middle line:90%
can be at counter-purposes.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Our lower mind and fear
can be at counter-purposes.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes, exactly.

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is kind of why
you call shadow work actually

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.810 align:middle line:90%
your soul's work--

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:11.062 align:middle line:90%
soul work.

00:22:11.062 --> 00:22:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And you have a different
notion of how this all

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.450 align:middle line:90%
works as a complex--

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:15.990 align:middle line:90%
as a mind/body complex--

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:17.667 align:middle line:90%
because it does involve our DNA.

00:22:17.667 --> 00:22:18.750 align:middle line:10%
It does involve ourselves.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:20.610 align:middle line:10%
It does involve
our subconscious,

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:21.570 align:middle line:10%
our superconscious.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:22.470 align:middle line:90%
So go for it.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:27.130 align:middle line:84%
We do have that model that we
tend to subscribe to the heart,

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:28.810 align:middle line:90%
mind, body and soul.

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:29.610 align:middle line:90%
And it's great.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:31.110 align:middle line:90%
It's effective.

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:34.320 align:middle line:84%
But I've refined that
a little bit more

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.740 align:middle line:84%
of psyche, soul,
body, and being.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.000 align:middle line:90%
The body is still the body.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.082 align:middle line:90%
It's still our physical.

00:22:40.082 --> 00:22:42.540 align:middle line:84%
It's that biochemistry that we
talked about-- the emotions,

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:43.920 align:middle line:90%
it's the subconscious.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.710 align:middle line:84%
It holds all of those
things in the physical part.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:49.095 align:middle line:84%
When we have trauma,
it's locked in the body.

00:22:49.095 --> 00:22:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And we can move our body
and we can do things

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.320 align:middle line:90%
with our body to release it.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.840 align:middle line:84%
But the body communicates
in a certain way

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.770 align:middle line:84%
and it has a certain
way of communicating.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And so when we look at our body
as a tool of communication,

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:01.873 align:middle line:84%
it will tell you
what our shadows are.

00:23:01.873 --> 00:23:03.540 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking
to a certain person,

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.520 align:middle line:84%
you suddenly get that
gut feeling like, ooh,

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling nauseated.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.260 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Or you're talking
to another person,

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.370 align:middle line:84%
and you're relaxed and
comfortable and flowing.

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.890 align:middle line:84%
That's the body giving
you subtle signals

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:18.030 align:middle line:84%
and communicating to your
awareness of what's going on.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:21.210 align:middle line:84%
The psyche is a combination of
what we think and what we feel,

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.010 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes
they're all connected.

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That we're
thinking these thoughts.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.820 align:middle line:84%
We have these repetitive
thoughts on replay.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.190 align:middle line:84%
We have these repetitive
emotions on replay

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:31.525 align:middle line:84%
that all still have
the biochemical to it.

00:23:31.525 --> 00:23:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And so we can be
aware of our thoughts,

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.880 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes we're not aware
of the repetitive thoughts.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.430 align:middle line:84%
We see somebody being successful
and, like, who did they

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:40.113 align:middle line:90%
rip off to make that happen?

00:23:40.113 --> 00:23:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Who did they step
on to get there?

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:42.090 align:middle line:90%
And like, wait--

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who did
they sleep with?

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:43.883 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:23:43.883 --> 00:23:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Those are some
repetitive thoughts

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.660 align:middle line:84%
that the shadow is, like, going
into our psyche, going, see,

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:50.100 align:middle line:84%
you're not this
kind of a person.

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.430 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't do
those kind of things.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:52.930 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you're
not successful.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:54.336 align:middle line:90%
It's like, hmm.

00:23:54.336 --> 00:23:55.136 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hmm.

00:23:55.136 --> 00:23:56.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And then
there is being which

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.910 align:middle line:84%
doesn't get addressed
too much, but it's

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:03.670 align:middle line:84%
how you are in the world,
how you exist in the world.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:06.250 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the people
that you keep around you,

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:08.320 align:middle line:84%
when you look at the
repetitive situations that

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.450 align:middle line:84%
are continuously
happening and say,

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.260 align:middle line:84%
why does this keep
happening to me?

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Why are these people
still in my life?

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Why do I keep having to
experience these things over

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:17.950 align:middle line:90%
and over again?

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:19.720 align:middle line:90%
That is the causal body.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Because if we look at
the subtle bodies--

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:23.050 align:middle line:84%
the mental body,
the emotional body,

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.600 align:middle line:84%
all that kind of thing-- that's
the causal body interacting

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.060 align:middle line:84%
with the world around
you, reflecting

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.760 align:middle line:84%
what your inner world is
going on so that it reflects

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:31.780 align:middle line:90%
to the external world.

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.103 align:middle line:84%
And it will tell you
what your shadows are.

00:24:34.103 --> 00:24:36.520 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to keep doing
the same project over and over

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.612 align:middle line:84%
but you keep failing
and you keep running

00:24:38.612 --> 00:24:39.820 align:middle line:90%
to the same stumbling blocks.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, all right,
I'm ready to give up.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's something
in the shadow.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And that shadow is being
reflected in the causality,

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:49.040 align:middle line:84%
and in the being around you
and the people around you.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And when you
resolve that shadow,

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.812 align:middle line:84%
it's like suddenly, oh, now
I got this job opportunity.

00:24:53.812 --> 00:24:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Now I have these
people in my life.

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:56.600 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.558 align:middle line:90%
Well, it came from you.

00:24:57.558 --> 00:24:58.933 align:middle line:84%
It came from
shifting the shadow.

00:24:58.933 --> 00:25:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's one
of your telltale signs.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.820 align:middle line:84%
You say when people are
searching for purpose

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:06.170 align:middle line:84%
and meaning in life and
no matter what they do,

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:07.900 align:middle line:84%
they keep coming
up empty-handed,

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.600 align:middle line:84%
you know you've got a shadow
that you have to address.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times that
comes from expectations.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:17.200 align:middle line:84%
My dad did this kind of work,
so that has to be what I do.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe
what you're looking

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.080 align:middle line:84%
for isn't in alignment
with your soul's purpose.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's blocking these
things from happening, too.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.290 align:middle line:90%
It's not always a shadow, right?

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:25.090 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.048 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It can just be
your counter-purposes.

00:25:27.048 --> 00:25:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Somebody might
think, I was supposed

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:30.637 align:middle line:90%
to be a musician in my life.

00:25:30.637 --> 00:25:31.780 align:middle line:90%
I need to be playing music.

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:33.140 align:middle line:90%
That was my whole thing.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:33.990 align:middle line:90%
And it never works.

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.790 align:middle line:90%
It never works.

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:35.590 align:middle line:90%
It never works.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, they're faced
with a dark night of the soul,

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:39.798 align:middle line:84%
everything comes
crashing in around them.

00:25:39.798 --> 00:25:41.650 align:middle line:90%
And they're, like, what?

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And then they go
into pet management.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:44.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's funny, I
was just thinking that.

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:46.570 align:middle line:90%
Pet management.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:47.060 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Pet management.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
oh, I hate this job.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:51.253 align:middle line:84%
Then as they're into
it more and more,

00:25:51.253 --> 00:25:52.840 align:middle line:90%
they're like, connecting--

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:53.640 align:middle line:90%
I see this.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.490 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly it's fulfilling.

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:57.240 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't pay the
money that they thought

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.730 align:middle line:84%
it was going to pay,
but they go home

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:01.870 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the day going,
wow, that was amazing.

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:02.670 align:middle line:90%
That was great.

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Look what happened.

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And now their life is
suddenly fulfilled.

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:09.600 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, oh, I get it.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.520 align:middle line:84%
I've actually worked with
some people over the years--

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.650 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of funny--

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:16.800 align:middle line:84%
where one person was making
high six-figure income.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.180 align:middle line:90%
They did their shadow work.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And now they're making
barely above minimum wage.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.070 align:middle line:90%
But they're loving it.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Another person was
flipping burgers at a fast food

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:29.550 align:middle line:84%
place, then suddenly they're
making six-figure incomes

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:30.810 align:middle line:90%
and they're loving it.

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:32.250 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with other
people that thought,

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:34.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to do this great,
important, big thing.

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, oh, no, I did
the great, important, big things

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:39.400 align:middle line:90%
last time.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.580 align:middle line:84%
This is my time to just chill
out and be hedonistic and have

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:43.600 align:middle line:90%
fun.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.070 align:middle line:84%
It's like it might not
be what you think it is.

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you
try, and try, and try,

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and it fails, and
fails, and fails,

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:51.550 align:middle line:90%
you're on the wrong path.

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Period.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Correct.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.665 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep pursuing
that, higher self

00:26:55.665 --> 00:26:57.040 align:middle line:84%
will hit the reset
button and you

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.540 align:middle line:84%
go through a dark
night of the soul.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:26:59.530 align:middle line:90%
You'll hit rock bottom.

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:01.010 align:middle line:90%
Everything will fall apart.

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that
is the greatest

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:04.660 align:middle line:84%
gift your higher
self can give you,

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.118 align:middle line:84%
even though it
sucks in the moment.

00:27:06.118 --> 00:27:06.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's terrible.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:07.780 align:middle line:90%
And it's horrible.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.655 align:middle line:84%
And some people just
want to escape from life

00:27:09.655 --> 00:27:10.630 align:middle line:90%
because it's so bad.

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And many
people now are--

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:15.983 align:middle line:84%
the suicide rate among
young men has skyrocketed.

00:27:15.983 --> 00:27:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: But if they
would just persist.

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:21.042 align:middle line:84%
If they realized that that rock
bottom is a foundation and that

00:27:21.042 --> 00:27:22.250 align:middle line:90%
you build on that foundation.

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:24.253 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
higher self wants.

00:27:24.253 --> 00:27:25.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about--

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.910 align:middle line:84%
it's coming in just
thinking about it.

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:32.300 align:middle line:84%
So Maureen Hancock--
she's talking--

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.100 align:middle line:90%
she's a medium.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Talks to a lot of people from
the other side, obviously.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.810 align:middle line:84%
A lot of young men who
have taken their own lives.

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:39.602 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing
they're saying repeatedly

00:27:39.602 --> 00:27:43.720 align:middle line:84%
is, oh, crap, if I just
waited or talked to someone.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.610 align:middle line:90%
I wish I hadn't jumped the gun.

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:47.950 align:middle line:90%
No pun intended on that one.

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's making me
wonder something.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:52.540 align:middle line:90%
So you're talking young men.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.130 align:middle line:90%
A lot of them are millennials.

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are even
the oldest Zoomers now.

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, this generation has
been defined very differently

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.090 align:middle line:84%
because it was the one where
everyone's given a gold star

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:05.110 align:middle line:90%
generation, right?

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:07.275 align:middle line:84%
First time that really
started happening in life

00:28:07.275 --> 00:28:09.400 align:middle line:84%
where you want to encourage
everyone, and make them

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.960 align:middle line:84%
feel their best and part
of, and so the competition

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.760 align:middle line:90%
was lessened.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And you didn't
have to go as deep

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and work as hard to get where
you wanted in certain things

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:21.040 align:middle line:90%
because acceptance was given.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Mom and dad's house
is already available.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:26.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering how
much that mindset

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:29.860 align:middle line:84%
that the boomers instilled
in that generation,

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.230 align:middle line:84%
trying to be helpful,
has to do with not being

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:35.440 align:middle line:84%
able to cope with the
challenges and the shadow

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.920 align:middle line:90%
side of their own being.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's kind of
a generational question.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:44.060 align:middle line:84%
It's just popping to mind why
so many are killing themselves

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:44.860 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: That's one of
the things I've looked at

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.250 align:middle line:84%
and working with
people over the years

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:50.740 align:middle line:90%
is I can't find a general topic.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:51.550 align:middle line:90%
I can't find--

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's no--

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --a generational thing.

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Because what will
be beneficial to one person

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.750 align:middle line:90%
is detrimental to another.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:58.010 align:middle line:84%
They're just interpreting
it differently.

00:28:58.010 --> 00:28:59.718 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is it
something in the field

00:28:59.718 --> 00:29:02.900 align:middle line:84%
itself right now that's
squeezing people to this point?

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, and it's just
their different personal

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.460 align:middle line:84%
interpretations of
what's going on.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And so ultimately if we feel
like we're at that threshold

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.790 align:middle line:84%
where we can't
handle it anymore--

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:16.810 align:middle line:84%
and I don't care who you are
or what the situation is,

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:19.115 align:middle line:84%
reach out to somebody like
me, reach out to somebody--

00:29:19.115 --> 00:29:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.843 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --because--

00:29:20.843 --> 00:29:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't do it.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, just don't do it
because exactly like you were

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.300 align:middle line:84%
saying, if they just wait, just
hold on for that little bit

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:27.350 align:middle line:90%
more--

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:29.558 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's the
message from the other side.

00:29:29.558 --> 00:29:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.200 align:middle line:90%
Something will shift.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Because look at that rock
bottom as a foundation

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.880 align:middle line:90%
that you can suddenly build on.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.080 align:middle line:90%
Here's the secret to that.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.112 align:middle line:90%
Here's the big secret.

00:29:39.112 --> 00:29:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
is also what I see

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:43.870 align:middle line:84%
as the pattern of people
saying, I can't do it anymore

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:46.480 align:middle line:84%
because they give
up on it, is we

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.830 align:middle line:90%
have the "Think and Grow Rich."

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.920 align:middle line:84%
We have "The Secret,"
the law of attraction,

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.060 align:middle line:90%
all of that sort of thing.

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.730 align:middle line:84%
It's missing a
very vital point--

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:57.400 align:middle line:90%
solve et coagula.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.777 align:middle line:84%
A lot of this law of
attraction stuff is coagula,

00:30:00.777 --> 00:30:02.860 align:middle line:84%
meaning we're going to
build, we're going to grow,

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:04.420 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
build, build, build.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.370 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't have
a solid foundation

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:08.130 align:middle line:84%
or if you've got
something already shaky,

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:09.505 align:middle line:84%
it's going to keep
falling apart.

00:30:09.505 --> 00:30:09.970 align:middle line:90%
It's going to fall apart.

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.460 align:middle line:84%
You got to let go of certain
things before you can build.

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.335 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And that's
where the solve comes in.

00:30:14.335 --> 00:30:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Solve is to dissolve,
to get rid of.

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.830 align:middle line:90%
You've got to clear space.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.330 align:middle line:84%
So if you see those
things that keep

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:21.650 align:middle line:84%
falling apart and falling
apart and falling apart,

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:23.200 align:middle line:90%
let's get to the foundation.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's clear that space so that
you can build it and make that

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.700 align:middle line:90%
a solid structure.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that's what
that dark night of the soul,

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:31.160 align:middle line:90%
that rock bottom is--

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:31.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --that
foundation to build it.

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautifully put.

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, what about the case
of genuine extreme trauma

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.330 align:middle line:84%
where a person has been
through extreme trauma

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:41.210 align:middle line:90%
in their lifetime?

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:44.327 align:middle line:84%
Now, this tweaks us
out on so many levels.

00:30:44.327 --> 00:30:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of it going around

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:49.390 align:middle line:84%
and there has been
for a long time.

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that is an
interesting dichotomy that's

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:54.150 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Because not only
do we have trauma

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.290 align:middle line:84%
of the people who are
victims, but we also

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:00.780 align:middle line:84%
have trauma of the people who
are the perpetuators of it.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And if both are unresolved
and they're not dealt with,

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:05.710 align:middle line:84%
we are going to have
a continuing cycle.

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:08.700 align:middle line:84%
So we need to be able to look
at the trauma for both of them.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to
trauma, it definitely

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:13.360 align:middle line:84%
takes trained practitioners
to help people through it

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.160 align:middle line:90%
because there are--

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I was
going to ask about that.

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:15.883 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --different techniques.

00:31:15.883 --> 00:31:18.840 align:middle line:84%
EMDR, there's a lot of
different somatic techniques

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.010 align:middle line:90%
that we can get into.

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:21.670 align:middle line:90%
Neurofeedback is amazing--

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it is amazing.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: --for helping.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.443 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: So we definitely
need to have that.

00:31:25.443 --> 00:31:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And shadow work is adjunct
help to trauma work.

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say shadow
work for trauma.

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:33.000 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Because the way we--

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not going
to replace that deep--

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:35.585 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --do shadow work, we
can actually re-traumatize.

00:31:35.585 --> 00:31:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Especially around
sexual trauma, which has been--

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:41.400 align:middle line:84%
now we're starting to see,
as the masks come off,

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.670 align:middle line:84%
and the data comes out, and
the stories come forward,

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:47.790 align:middle line:84%
has been a deep part
of the human story

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:48.900 align:middle line:90%
since the beginning.

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:49.733 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:31:49.733 --> 00:31:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Institutional
sexual abuse.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:53.265 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:31:53.265 --> 00:31:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And so when we do shadow
work, when we go into,

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:57.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm having this
self-conscious feeling,

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.700 align:middle line:84%
what's that all about,
why can't I perform,

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.010 align:middle line:84%
or why can't I do these
things, with shadow work,

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:03.390 align:middle line:90%
we go, OK, what is that feeling?

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:04.515 align:middle line:90%
Let's go into that feeling.

00:32:04.515 --> 00:32:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to where I learned
where that feeling was.

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And if it's sexual
trauma, ah-ah,

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.280 align:middle line:84%
we don't want to go there
and do that kind of work.

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.705 align:middle line:90%
We want to get the EMDR.

00:32:12.705 --> 00:32:14.080 align:middle line:84%
We want to get
the neurofeedback.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.600 align:middle line:84%
We want to get the
somatic training.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And then we can do
the shadow work.

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And then we can go, OK, I see
how this was protecting me.

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:21.630 align:middle line:90%
I see how this was helping.

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:23.340 align:middle line:90%
They can work together.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:26.827 align:middle line:84%
But shadow work is really
good for spiritual growth,

00:32:26.827 --> 00:32:28.410 align:middle line:84%
for spiritual
development, for working

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:30.630 align:middle line:90%
through blocks and patterns.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:32.820 align:middle line:84%
But with trauma, we
need extra help, too.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Besides
deep sexual trauma,

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:37.410 align:middle line:84%
what are some of the
other forms of trauma

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:40.050 align:middle line:84%
that you would say-- you would
apply the same standard to

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:41.340 align:middle line:90%
or get extra help.

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Not only physical abuse
in the house, religious abuse--

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:47.820 align:middle line:84%
you're going to hell if this
happens or that happens.

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:50.490 align:middle line:84%
A weird little religious
abuse that's popping up now

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:54.030 align:middle line:84%
lately is people who believe
in the rapture coming

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:55.470 align:middle line:90%
and the kids are left at home.

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:57.270 align:middle line:84%
They're latchkey
kids and mom and dad

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:59.370 align:middle line:84%
are late getting home
for whatever reason.

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Kids are sitting at home going,
I knew I was this bad person.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.270 align:middle line:90%
I knew I was terrible.

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:06.030 align:middle line:84%
The rapture's happened
and I got left behind.

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, wait, we
got to resolve that one.

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Other trauma that does
pop up quite a bit

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:16.120 align:middle line:84%
is people who served overseas
and served in the military,

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.690 align:middle line:84%
because not only are the
things that they saw--

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:19.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That they did.

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:21.148 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --but the
things that they

00:33:21.148 --> 00:33:23.320 align:middle line:84%
had to do, that they
had to do to survive.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.247 align:middle line:84%
That's that perpetrator
trauma that we have.

00:33:25.247 --> 00:33:26.830 align:middle line:84%
That the people who
are doing things--

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you're
being ordered to.

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And you have to do it to survive
or you don't have that thought

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:33.048 align:middle line:90%
process or to avoid it.

00:33:33.048 --> 00:33:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I can't fathom.

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: So we come back
here and that can create

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:37.510 align:middle line:90%
some cycles going through.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:40.330 align:middle line:84%
So that is a very common
one that I'm seeing,

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:41.320 align:middle line:90%
both men and women.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now that's one you
would say go to a professional

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.980 align:middle line:90%
for?

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Mhm.

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, and we'll
work together on that.

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:49.870 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely will
work with that.

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's, like, and
you need somebody

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:55.040 align:middle line:84%
who is deeply trained in
trauma work to help with that.

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.260 align:middle line:90%
It's just an and.

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, I could see
where in that situation

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:06.790 align:middle line:84%
a person might have the
spiritual awakening through why

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:10.600 align:middle line:84%
did I allow myself to
follow an order to do this

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.920 align:middle line:90%
to another human being?

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.929 align:middle line:90%
Why did I allow this?

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:15.909 align:middle line:84%
Because in the
last final moment,

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:17.530 align:middle line:84%
I guess you could--
now, you'd be

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:20.679 align:middle line:84%
court martialed, maybe thrown
in jail, but you could say,

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:22.120 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.570 align:middle line:90%
I won't do it.

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big
deal in the military

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:27.370 align:middle line:84%
is just you don't want
to get in that situation.

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:29.690 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: In the moment,
you don't have a choice.

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:32.500 align:middle line:84%
You fall back to your
training without thought,

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.179 align:middle line:90%
without concern or consequence.

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:34.989 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But isn't that
somewhere where someone

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:36.190 align:middle line:90%
would go in the shadow work?

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes, exactly.

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:39.110 align:middle line:90%
And that will be it.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:42.190 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of what we would
do is in that moment, remember,

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:43.159 align:middle line:90%
you had no choice.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:44.350 align:middle line:90%
You had to do that one.

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:45.233 align:middle line:90%
And now who you are--

00:34:45.233 --> 00:34:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But does part of you
feel guilty that you should

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:49.570 align:middle line:84%
have made a different choice,
even though you really

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:50.290 align:middle line:90%
couldn't?

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:51.390 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't.

00:34:51.390 --> 00:34:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of what we do
is we help realize you couldn't

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:55.440 align:middle line:90%
make a different choice.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.190 align:middle line:84%
That's the only thing
you could have done.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And now who you are today, you
can choose to be differently.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And how do you feel that
you want to atone for that?

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.600 align:middle line:90%
How do you pay it forward?

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:06.850 align:middle line:90%
Because you can't pay it back.

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:07.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: But you
can pay it forward.

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:09.950 align:middle line:90%
What can we do going forward?

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And then that will help them
find some sense of fulfillment

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.640 align:middle line:84%
and purpose, where before it was
like, I don't deserve purpose,

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:16.863 align:middle line:90%
I don't deserve fulfillment.

00:35:16.863 --> 00:35:18.280 align:middle line:84%
But now they're
paying it forward.

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.810 align:middle line:84%
How do we move
forward with this?

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:20.643 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful.

00:35:20.643 --> 00:35:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And then it's,
like, suddenly, oh, this

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:24.760 align:middle line:84%
is how I can heal from
that and how I can help

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.150 align:middle line:90%
heal the world from that, too.

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:27.935 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:35:27.935 --> 00:35:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about when other
beings are surfing off of you

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:33.520 align:middle line:84%
and playing with you and
causing disturbances.

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.150 align:middle line:90%
Beings who are disincarnate.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yep.

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I have learned that 90% of
our thoughts and feelings

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:39.910 align:middle line:90%
are not our own.

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's like a
big thing to think about.

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:44.080 align:middle line:84%
But when we really
look at the world,

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:47.135 align:middle line:84%
we are filled with energy
fields all over the place.

00:35:47.135 --> 00:35:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And all of those energy fields
have different programming

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:50.310 align:middle line:90%
in it.

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:52.870 align:middle line:84%
We are powerfully
creative beings as humans.

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:55.030 align:middle line:84%
We create thought
forms all the time

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:57.460 align:middle line:84%
based off of our persistent
thoughts or beliefs.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And our emotions will create
these thought forms that feed

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.960 align:middle line:90%
back that information on us.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.115 align:middle line:84%
We create egregore with
our collective beliefs.

00:36:04.115 --> 00:36:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we do.

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:07.060 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: We create
tulpas as entities

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.520 align:middle line:84%
that need to-- we are
creating these things

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.410 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain
to people who don't

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:12.940 align:middle line:84%
know what egregores and
tulpas are, so they know.

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Great point.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.390 align:middle line:84%
An egregore is a
collectively created being

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:19.480 align:middle line:84%
that is built up of
our continued belief.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:22.210 align:middle line:84%
If we believe--
this is a fun one--

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:25.360 align:middle line:84%
if we believe that
one day of the year,

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.070 align:middle line:84%
there is this entity that visits
all of our homes and delivers

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:28.870 align:middle line:90%
presents--

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Santa Claus.

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:29.620 align:middle line:90%
My favorite--

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:30.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --person.

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:34.890 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: He delivers these
presents to all the children.

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:35.960 align:middle line:90%
That's an egregore.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And the way that you know it
is when you have that Christmas

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Eve feeling, you've got
that sense of reverence,

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:43.590 align:middle line:84%
that sense of generosity,
there's that magic in the air.

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're in the
presence of the egregore we've

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.910 align:middle line:90%
co-created through this delight.

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So egregores can be
very positive things.

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:53.040 align:middle line:84%
They can also be
very negative things,

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:56.550 align:middle line:84%
like there are these type
of beings in this world that

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:58.650 align:middle line:84%
are influencing our
politicians and making

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:00.780 align:middle line:84%
certain financial
decisions for corporations.

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.198 align:middle line:90%
And they're out there.

00:37:02.198 --> 00:37:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're creating these because
we have this constant belief

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:05.460 align:middle line:90%
that they're out there.

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:06.450 align:middle line:90%
And then they are out there.

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
constantly focused that way.

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And we're constantly--
and they're here--

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.800 align:middle line:84%
we don't realize it, but
they might be here guiding

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:18.810 align:middle line:84%
us to feel inadequate, to
feel that money is evil

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:21.030 align:middle line:84%
or that these things are
terrible and awful things.

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let us
handle it for you.

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And a tulpa is more
of a being that

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:30.510 align:middle line:84%
is created that has a
purpose, that you created it

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:33.360 align:middle line:84%
so that it helps to run
the company, so to speak.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And as a company grows,
this tulpa grows.

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:38.723 align:middle line:84%
And its purpose is to bring
more people to the company.

00:37:38.723 --> 00:37:40.140 align:middle line:84%
It can be a very
beneficial thing.

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:42.030 align:middle line:84%
A tulpa for a company
can be a very good thing.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:42.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: But at the same time,
it could also be destructive.

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Eat more of these hamburgers
and these French fries

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.890 align:middle line:84%
over and over and
over again because it

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:52.350 align:middle line:90%
supports-- the various things.

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's
an entity created

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:56.730 align:middle line:84%
through our consciousness
in the most extreme form

00:37:56.730 --> 00:38:00.000 align:middle line:84%
that some of the more
skilled Tibetan Buddhists

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.390 align:middle line:84%
create an actual being,
an actual person.

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:05.970 align:middle line:84%
They manifest a being
in front of them

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:08.010 align:middle line:84%
that they can
interact with and see.

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:10.800 align:middle line:84%
But my understanding from
what I've read about it

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.630 align:middle line:84%
is they are charged
with destroying it

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:13.860 align:middle line:90%
after they create it.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:16.550 align:middle line:84%
But in our society,
these things get

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:18.300 align:middle line:84%
created all the time
with nobody realizing

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:19.570 align:middle line:90%
that they've been created.

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:21.930 align:middle line:84%
So nobody's out
there to destroy them

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:24.120 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes they gain
their own sovereignty.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's the point.

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:26.190 align:middle line:90%
Gaining-- yes.

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And once you create
that and set it free,

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:30.107 align:middle line:84%
you don't know
what kind of steam

00:38:30.107 --> 00:38:32.190 align:middle line:84%
it's going to pick up,
depending on the influences

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:33.982 align:middle line:84%
of your thought and
the collective thought.

00:38:33.982 --> 00:38:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And a way I can
think about this--

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:40.800 align:middle line:84%
and this is not an accurate
model by any means--

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.350 align:middle line:84%
is we are here in third
dimension reality,

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:44.730 align:middle line:90%
the physical world.

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Our spiritual essence,
our higher being,

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.530 align:middle line:84%
our spiritual existence
is fifth density,

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:50.910 align:middle line:90%
just for sake of being.

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: But this layer of
fourth density in between,

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.710 align:middle line:84%
let's imagine it's
like a sandbox where

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:57.700 align:middle line:84%
we can create all sorts
of wonderful things,

00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:59.400 align:middle line:84%
and great things,
and awesome things.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.558 align:middle line:90%
That's where the tulpa is.

00:39:00.558 --> 00:39:02.100 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
energy wells, that's

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.740 align:middle line:84%
where the reality tunnels
and reality bubbles,

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:07.645 align:middle line:84%
the egregores-- all of those
things live in that 4D reality.

00:39:07.645 --> 00:39:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: They're just
as real as we are.

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.090 align:middle line:84%
They're just-- they're
influencing us.

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:14.370 align:middle line:84%
But as we go through
our day-to-day life,

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:15.900 align:middle line:90%
if we're not aware--

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.090 align:middle line:84%
we come back to
awareness-- if we're not

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:20.940 align:middle line:84%
aware of this persistent
emotional feeling that's

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:25.530 align:middle line:84%
coming towards us is external,
we take it on as like, oh,

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:26.988 align:middle line:84%
I'm just so depressed
all the time.

00:39:26.988 --> 00:39:27.788 align:middle line:90%
I'm just so sad.

00:39:27.788 --> 00:39:28.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm just so scared.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:30.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm just so angry all the time.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:31.410 align:middle line:90%
When it's really this thing--

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's coming
from this field.

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:32.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --where we have this
persistent thought all the time

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:37.150 align:middle line:84%
as, like, we need to go
over there and get them

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:37.950 align:middle line:90%
before they get us.

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:39.660 align:middle line:84%
We need to go over there and
get them before they get us.

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:41.430 align:middle line:84%
We got to stop this
before they get us.

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not good.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: That's all there.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:46.560 align:middle line:84%
But if we can stop,
center, focus our mind

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and go, wait a minute,
that's not my thought.

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:52.230 align:middle line:90%
Those aren't my emotions.

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Why did I agree to
take on those emotions?

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Why did I agree to
take those thoughts on?

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:58.422 align:middle line:84%
Because we have to have
something internal.

00:39:58.422 --> 00:40:00.350 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be an
anchor point inside.

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:02.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's where the
shadow work comes from.

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:05.880 align:middle line:84%
We have to go inside and go, OK,
what part of me agreed to this

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.680 align:middle line:90%
and why?

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:09.300 align:middle line:90%
What did I gain from this?

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly
we go, OK, now I

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:14.060 align:middle line:84%
don't need to have
that influence anymore.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And what's
weird about this--

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:19.730 align:middle line:84%
this casts its own problem
because shadow work

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:22.970 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual development
can be destructive.

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Because if we grew up
thinking a certain way,

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.230 align:middle line:84%
believing a certain
way, and it comes

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:29.120 align:middle line:84%
from that collective
egregore, the community

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.040 align:middle line:84%
that we were a part
of and we grew up in,

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.677 align:middle line:84%
we do our shadow work
and we're suddenly like--

00:40:33.677 --> 00:40:34.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're cast out.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --I don't
need that anymore.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't
need it anymore.

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:39.500 align:middle line:84%
You either cast yourself
out or you are cast out.

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:40.505 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:40:40.505 --> 00:40:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's go back
again to Santa Claus,

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:43.180 align:middle line:90%
my favorite person.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:43.980 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:45.085 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:45.085 --> 00:40:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love the movie
"Elf" with Will Ferrell.

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yes.

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But let's talk
about that for a moment.

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:55.070 align:middle line:84%
What is created when you tell
little children about Santa

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Claus and you wait with
such delight year after year

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:00.780 align:middle line:84%
till you're somewhere five,
six, seven eight years old,

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:03.230 align:middle line:84%
and then they say,
oh, just kidding,

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:05.190 align:middle line:90%
there's no Santa Claus.

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:06.750 align:middle line:90%
What does that create?

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Because I know it's
devastating to most children.

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:10.750 align:middle line:90%
It's almost a trauma--

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:13.635 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to find
out that was a lie.

00:41:13.635 --> 00:41:16.170 align:middle line:90%


00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:17.700 align:middle line:90%
Why do we do this?

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And how can we reframe it so
we don't traumatize people

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:24.537 align:middle line:84%
with such a huge letdown from
the grace of Santa Claus?

00:41:24.537 --> 00:41:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: I think we do
it in the first place

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.740 align:middle line:84%
because it helps us
capture the magic when

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:31.707 align:middle line:84%
we're adults, that magic we
had when we were children.

00:41:31.707 --> 00:41:32.790 align:middle line:90%
And so we want that again.

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before they pulled
the rug out from under us.

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:36.563 align:middle line:84%
They pulled the rug
out from under us.

00:41:36.563 --> 00:41:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And then we have this
collective belief, as a society,

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:40.410 align:middle line:84%
well, when you get
to a certain age,

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:42.720 align:middle line:84%
you just need to face
reality and toughen up and--

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, you don't.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.180 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: --go out and do what
the world expects of you.

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And that is that ripping
the Band-Aid off.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.610 align:middle line:84%
That's one of
those multiple ways

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:52.460 align:middle line:90%
of ripping the Band-Aid off.

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:53.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's shock.

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's supposed to
be some kind of rite of passage

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:58.813 align:middle line:84%
to devastate a five,
six, seven-year-old?

00:41:58.813 --> 00:42:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: But instead,
like with my kids,

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.040 align:middle line:84%
they know I believe
in Santa, that I

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:03.360 align:middle line:90%
know it's still real today.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.055 align:middle line:84%
And they're aware of the
magic and the mysticism

00:42:06.055 --> 00:42:06.930 align:middle line:90%
behind what Santa is.

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bingo.

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:09.190 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:11.347 align:middle line:84%
So instead of just
ripping the Band-Aid off,

00:42:11.347 --> 00:42:12.930 align:middle line:84%
learn a little more
about Santa Claus.

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:13.380 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Exactly.

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:14.280 align:middle line:90%
Tell them what it is.

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Because now that-- my kids
know what egregores are.

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.640 align:middle line:90%
They know how they work.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And they know that
Santa is a real thing

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:20.850 align:middle line:90%
because we created it.

00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:21.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:21.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And they
didn't lose that magic.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:27.360 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go into
one more thing before we

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.620 align:middle line:90%
say, ooh, goodness, goodbye.

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And that is the dark goddess
and the dark feminine energy

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:32.310 align:middle line:90%
and how it plays.

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:34.320 align:middle line:84%
We've been talking about
men and masculine work.

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:37.040 align:middle line:84%
How's the dark goddess and
dark feminine play into this?

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: You know, actually,
how I found the dark goddess is

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:40.825 align:middle line:90%
because of men.

00:42:40.825 --> 00:42:42.450 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the men I
worked with overseas

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:44.988 align:middle line:84%
kept telling me about a
dark goddess showing up.

00:42:44.988 --> 00:42:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't know
what to name it.

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:47.330 align:middle line:90%
Some of them did.

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:48.613 align:middle line:90%
Some said, oh, it's Hecate.

00:42:48.613 --> 00:42:49.530 align:middle line:90%
Some said it's Lilith.

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:50.850 align:middle line:90%
Some said it's Hel--

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:52.348 align:middle line:90%
the Norse goddess Hel.

00:42:52.348 --> 00:42:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they had a name,
sometimes they didn't.

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:56.850 align:middle line:84%
But they kept telling me
about a female presence that's

00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:58.020 align:middle line:90%
very powerful.

00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Most of them are
afraid of it, that she

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.062 align:middle line:84%
would show up, sometimes
be very demanding of them.

00:43:03.062 --> 00:43:04.395 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Every man's nightmare.

00:43:04.395 --> 00:43:06.565 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:06.565 --> 00:43:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And so I
had to dig into this.

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:09.857 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, what
is this dark goddess?

00:43:09.857 --> 00:43:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Not only working with
the guys and trying

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:14.530 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what this was
and what she's all about,

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:17.550 align:middle line:84%
and I realized she
is still a goddess.

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And by goddess, she's
nurturing, she's caring.

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:22.000 align:middle line:90%
She taps into resources.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.175 align:middle line:90%
She's wonderful and amazing.

00:43:23.175 --> 00:43:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She's just
stirring your pot a bit.

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:26.967 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: She's stirring
your pot a little bit.

00:43:26.967 --> 00:43:30.737 align:middle line:84%
She gets you riled
up because maybe

00:43:30.737 --> 00:43:32.820 align:middle line:84%
some of that trauma, maybe
some of that dark stuff

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.380 align:middle line:90%
that isn't being let go.

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And we can't let go
of that if we're just

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:38.280 align:middle line:84%
going to throw peace, love,
and light and happiness on it.

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:39.930 align:middle line:84%
You can't do puppy
dogs and rainbows.

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:42.600 align:middle line:84%
You have to go, I
did these things,

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.910 align:middle line:84%
I thought about these
things, these things

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:46.260 align:middle line:90%
are holding me back.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:47.987 align:middle line:84%
You have to get into
your own darkness.

00:43:47.987 --> 00:43:49.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's what she's all about.

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:52.650 align:middle line:84%
She's that brutal, dark
side of the goddess that

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:55.380 align:middle line:84%
forces you to take that deep
inner look into yourself,

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:57.600 align:middle line:84%
that deep inner look
into your own energies

00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:00.180 align:middle line:84%
so that you can actually
heal through it.

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:02.862 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, she's scary as heck
when she first shows up.

00:44:02.862 --> 00:44:04.320 align:middle line:84%
But when you start
to work with her

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.050 align:middle line:84%
and you start to realize what
her gifts are and benefits,

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:11.370 align:middle line:84%
you realize, no, she's this
beautiful, wanted, lovely,

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:13.158 align:middle line:90%
awesome presence to have around.

00:44:13.158 --> 00:44:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And when we're
working with her, it's

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:18.690 align:middle line:84%
like it eases the shadow work
so much better because she's

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:21.500 align:middle line:84%
such a powerful resource to
helping us release shadow work.

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, wonderful.

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:23.300 align:middle line:90%
I just love it.

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:24.570 align:middle line:90%
You're magical, Kaedrich.

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:26.290 align:middle line:90%
And so any final thoughts.

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:27.570 align:middle line:90%
We are about out of time here.

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts on people
that are just really feeling

00:44:30.570 --> 00:44:33.180 align:middle line:84%
the weight of life and the
field and the world around them

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:34.180 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Right.

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:37.180 align:middle line:84%
When you're feeling
that weight of life,

00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:39.210 align:middle line:84%
I want you to just
go into that feeling.

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Let yourself feel it
without any judgment,

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:42.780 align:middle line:90%
without any criticism.

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Because what if--
just what if-- that

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:47.310 align:middle line:84%
is what your higher self wanted
to experience for right now?

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:49.050 align:middle line:84%
What if there is
a gift into that?

00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:50.280 align:middle line:90%
And I know it's tough.

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:51.780 align:middle line:90%
And I know it's hard.

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:54.180 align:middle line:84%
But allow yourself to say,
what is this all about?

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:55.440 align:middle line:90%
Why am I experiencing it?

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.700 align:middle line:90%
What lessons are here for me?

00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And then ask it--
literally, ask it--

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:04.050 align:middle line:84%
what is something that I
can do in the next 48 hours

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:07.567 align:middle line:84%
to help relieve this weight,
to help relieve this tension,

00:45:07.567 --> 00:45:09.150 align:middle line:84%
so that I can go out
and do something?

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:10.860 align:middle line:90%
And then commit to doing it.

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And seeing what
happens from that.

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Because that's all
it's really there

00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:16.710 align:middle line:84%
for is sometimes
that pressure is not

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:18.840 align:middle line:84%
to keep you locked
into place, but it's

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:22.363 align:middle line:84%
our fear of what happens when
that pressure is gone is really

00:45:22.363 --> 00:45:23.280 align:middle line:90%
what that pressure is.

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.470 align:middle line:10%
So when you start
doing something,

00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:27.270 align:middle line:10%
that pressure relief
feeling like--

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:28.800 align:middle line:10%
it's like that old
saying, it's not

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.940 align:middle line:10%
our darkness we're afraid
of, it's our light.

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>OLSEN: And that's
what this pressure is.

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Like, wait, I can do these
things, but I'm afraid to.

00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's OK because that
fear is helping you, too.

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is where I
go into meta shadows.

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you're looking at
one shadow, then this one,

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:45.785 align:middle line:90%
then this one and this one.

00:45:45.785 --> 00:45:47.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like, make friends
with all of them.

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
shadow has babies.

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah, exactly.

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:49.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.388 align:middle line:10%
Make friends with all
of them and they'll

00:45:51.388 --> 00:45:53.960 align:middle line:10%
teach you about yourself,
what's wonderful and amazing

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:55.250 align:middle line:10%
about yourself.

00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:59.367 align:middle line:10%
And then that's what you clue in
on and use to find your light.

00:45:59.367 --> 00:46:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So be
patient with yourself.

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:02.190 align:middle line:90%
Let yourself go into it.

00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:03.185 align:middle line:90%
No judgment of self.

00:46:03.185 --> 00:46:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Self-grace is amazing.

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then, of course,
they can always call Kaedrich.

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Yeah.

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.383 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
so much, Kaedrich.

00:46:08.383 --> 00:46:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely delightful
conversation--

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>>OLSEN: Thank you, too.

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:10.910 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:11.993 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --about shadows.

00:46:11.993 --> 00:46:13.490 align:middle line:90%
