00:00:08.964 --> 00:00:13.944 align:middle line:90%
[INTRO MUSIC]

00:00:13.944 --> 00:00:20.182 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.182 --> 00:00:21.640 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Well, most of us

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.223 align:middle line:10%
are quite comfortable
with considering

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.240 align:middle line:10%
the ubiquitous nature
of energy and how it

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.430 align:middle line:10%
can be accessed and
used in our lives.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.430 align:middle line:84%
We're often less comfortable
with how it shows up as money.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Cynthia Sue Larson was
with us a couple of years

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.900 align:middle line:84%
ago talking about
quantum jumping, how

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.989 align:middle line:90%
space and time are not fixed.

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.530 align:middle line:84%
In one of her other
books, she speaks

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.992 align:middle line:84%
about how these
principles apply to money.

00:00:40.992 --> 00:00:42.700 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about that, and we're

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.120 align:middle line:84%
going to also go back into some
of what we talked about before.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.497 align:middle line:84%
Because this is just energy,
intention, money, love.

00:00:51.497 --> 00:00:53.830 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really matter what
you're trying to manifest.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.620 align:middle line:84%
This particular book, which
I just thought was so sweet,

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.450 align:middle line:84%
happens to be
dedicated to money,

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.940 align:middle line:84%
which is the source of a lot
of stress in a lot of people's

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.020 align:middle line:90%
lives right now.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.810 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, why not
apply the principles there?

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.060 align:middle line:84%
But let's, first of
all, talk about those

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.860 align:middle line:84%
who haven't seen
the first interview,

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.120 align:middle line:84%
a little bit about your own
background in economics,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.920 align:middle line:90%
in science--

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have quite an
interesting background.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about
you for a moment first.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.635 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNTHIA SUE LARSON: Sure.

00:01:20.635 --> 00:01:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've got a physics
degree from UC Berkeley.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.800 align:middle line:10%
I started there.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.160 align:middle line:10%
And that was in response
to my lifelong interest

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.390 align:middle line:10%
in the nature of reality.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.780 align:middle line:84%
So that was a good way to
explore the quantum physics,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.600 align:middle line:84%
especially, I thought
was most interesting.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, I
did get an MBA degree

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and had a specialization
in information systems,

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.550 align:middle line:84%
so that stood me in perfect
position to move into finance,

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.600 align:middle line:90%
which I did.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.590 align:middle line:84%
So I worked in finance
for a number of years.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And that was my introduction
to money and working with it.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: However,
as we both know,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.350 align:middle line:84%
I also am something of a
quantum mystic, you might say.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Flipping back and forth
between time zones--

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yeah.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.811 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --all the time.

00:02:04.811 --> 00:02:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.567 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is why
you are the only person

00:02:07.567 --> 00:02:09.983 align:middle line:84%
I know that doesn't have a
cell phone because you're still

00:02:09.983 --> 00:02:11.140 align:middle line:90%
living in, what, in 1960?

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.004 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:14.868 align:middle line:90%
That's so funny.

00:02:14.868 --> 00:02:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yeah, well,
things do change for me.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And my comfort level has
considerably changed,

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.730 align:middle line:84%
as this has been going on
for a number of years now.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.590 align:middle line:84%
But about 20 years ago in
the late 1990s or mid-1990s,

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.470 align:middle line:84%
I started noticing that
things would change.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.269 align:middle line:84%
They would appear,
disappear, including money.

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not so good when
it disappears, better

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.180 align:middle line:90%
when it appears.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.010 align:middle line:90%
But it's fun to play with.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's been something
that I've been exploring along

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:45.920 align:middle line:90%
with everything else.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's really one
of the keynotes of this book

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.090 align:middle line:84%
called "High Energy Money" is
that, yeah, it appears, and it

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.880 align:middle line:84%
can disappear, but you say
the journey has to be fun.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.150 align:middle line:84%
This is really critical
in all things, right?

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.025 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Absolutely.

00:02:59.025 --> 00:03:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because if there's
not the fuel of either passion,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.500 align:middle line:84%
joy, pleasure, something
of that nature that

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.687 align:middle line:84%
makes you want to engage
with it-- you want to.

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:09.020 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to make yourself.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.260 align:middle line:90%
It's not a discipline.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.110 align:middle line:90%
You want to engage with it.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.100 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And that is the plasma
fuel of creation.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Exactly.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.930 align:middle line:84%
So there needs to be that
true sense of, like you say,

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.450 align:middle line:90%
fun, joy, excitement, passion.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And these are very
human qualities,

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.287 align:middle line:84%
and we seldom really
link it up with money.

00:03:27.287 --> 00:03:28.870 align:middle line:84%
We don't tend to
think of it that way.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We don't.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think the predominant
emotion with most people

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.970 align:middle line:90%
around money is probably fear.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Anxiety.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.525 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:03:37.525 --> 00:03:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.705 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then you're left
brain engages to problem-solve.

00:03:40.705 --> 00:03:41.635 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:03:41.635 --> 00:03:43.987 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The right brain is
usually completely shut out

00:03:43.987 --> 00:03:46.570 align:middle line:84%
because you're going to be some
whack job if you try to go off

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.695 align:middle line:90%
the reservation, right?

00:03:47.695 --> 00:03:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well, I've
seen some amazing things

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.410 align:middle line:90%
happen with money.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And because of
the reality shifts

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.790 align:middle line:84%
that I've become
quite familiar with,

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.600 align:middle line:84%
I just recognize, oh, good,
now I've got one with money.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example, when I
needed some money recently

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have enough in my
bank account, it's OK with me

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.620 align:middle line:84%
when I can't track
how it came in.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.747 align:middle line:84%
But now, there's
extra money there.

00:04:08.747 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't you call the
bank and say, I'm so sorry;

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.055 align:middle line:90%
this must be an error?

00:04:12.055 --> 00:04:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I go
through line by line

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.710 align:middle line:84%
online with every
single transaction,

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.500 align:middle line:84%
every single thing,
just tracking it

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.784 align:middle line:90%
against my checking book.

00:04:18.784 --> 00:04:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But If there's
extra money there,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.035 align:middle line:84%
you don't tell him to
take it back, do you?

00:04:23.035 --> 00:04:25.095 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well, it's
like a rising tide--

00:04:25.095 --> 00:04:25.895 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:04:25.895 --> 00:04:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: So it's like, I
figure everybody's doing fine.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.971 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: There's no trace
that it came from anywhere.

00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:33.220 align:middle line:90%
And this does actually happen.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.550 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into
some really kind of fun

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.380 align:middle line:90%
examples of this in your book.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.800 align:middle line:84%
But again, I want to get
back to the quantum physics

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.490 align:middle line:84%
realm of it, kind of
the mechanics of that,

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and how it works, and
how time is not really

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.240 align:middle line:84%
as much a factor except
in our own perception.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.670 align:middle line:90%
I've worked this hard.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.850 align:middle line:90%
It's next Tuesday.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get my paycheck.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.297 align:middle line:90%
It will stretch this far.

00:04:58.297 --> 00:04:59.380 align:middle line:90%
And that's all you've got.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.171 align:middle line:84%
And if you run out at
the end of the month,

00:05:01.171 --> 00:05:04.150 align:middle line:84%
you freak out until the
cycle starts all over again--

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.360 align:middle line:84%
in the lives of many, many,
many people on this planet,

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.600 align:middle line:90%
most people on this planet.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.000 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.300 align:middle line:90%
That's not a good way to live.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.210 align:middle line:90%
I think we can agree with that.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I can personally
attest to the fact

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.060 align:middle line:84%
that you don't need to obsess
with that level of angst

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.620 align:middle line:84%
and anxiety related to
what seems like lack.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.840 align:middle line:90%
Because the lack is just--

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.390 align:middle line:84%
it looks real, but
what we're learning

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.840 align:middle line:84%
about the nature of reality is
that there's consciousness that

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.252 align:middle line:90%
is the most fundamental thing.

00:05:33.252 --> 00:05:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's what quantum
physics shows us.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Even the founder of quantum
physics, Max Planck,

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.510 align:middle line:84%
actually said, "Consciousness
is fundamental."

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Nothing can get
behind consciousness.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.240 align:middle line:90%
That's the primary field.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.157 align:middle line:90%
That's what's there first.

00:05:48.157 --> 00:05:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it sounds like the
first order of business before

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.080 align:middle line:90%
anyone tackles this subject--

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.180 align:middle line:84%
or even if they don't
tackle it this way,

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.850 align:middle line:84%
by way of this conversation
but in their own lives

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.080 align:middle line:90%
is to understand--

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.370 align:middle line:90%
we call it miracles.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can just
say an alternate reality.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.591 align:middle line:84%
These things come to
pass all the time.

00:06:05.591 --> 00:06:07.090 align:middle line:84%
People are always
surprised, saying,

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.119 align:middle line:84%
I swear to God I
didn't put that there.

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:14.410 align:middle line:84%
I have a couple of examples
just off the top of my head

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.620 align:middle line:84%
that are kind of filtering
back in right now, where,

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.270 align:middle line:84%
say, a piece of jewelry
that's been missing--

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.930 align:middle line:84%
in fact, one time it
happened here at Gaia.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.410 align:middle line:90%
I lost a gold earring, right?

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
happened to like it.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.010 align:middle line:84%
It was my favorite pair,
but I lost it, right?

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now I looked all
over the office to put it

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.041 align:middle line:84%
on before the show that
day, nowhere to be found,

00:06:36.041 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:90%
nowhere to be found.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And then, I talked to the
man who was the maintenance

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.310 align:middle line:90%
person who vacuums at night.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.470 align:middle line:90%
He said, never saw it.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And about three or
four months later,

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.870 align:middle line:84%
it showed up in the
middle of the floor.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Wow.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the
middle of the floor.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Where it
could never have been.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:52.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Could never have been.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: It would
have been vacuumed.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because I
would have walked over it

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.010 align:middle line:84%
with so many other
people many, many times

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.801 align:middle line:84%
in the intervening
months, but there it is.

00:06:58.801 --> 00:07:00.150 align:middle line:90%
And that's just a tiny example.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.110 align:middle line:84%
But those things do happen
with some regularity

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.424 align:middle line:90%
in all of our lives, right?

00:07:03.424 --> 00:07:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: For me,
quite a bit yes.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is
happening there?

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Ha-ha.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:06.744 align:middle line:90%


00:07:06.744 --> 00:07:08.035 align:middle line:90%
You go straight to the jugular.

00:07:08.035 --> 00:07:09.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, let's go for it.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: OK.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, my best take on this
is that we're actually

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.920 align:middle line:84%
living not so much in
the classical realm,

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.464 align:middle line:90%
but in a quantum realm.

00:07:17.464 --> 00:07:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's not at all like
what you see in the movies,

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.690 align:middle line:84%
with "Ant-Man", where
there's that "quantum realm."

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.650 align:middle line:84%
What I'm actually saying is
that the quantum is everything.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And the classical
is the special case.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.330 align:middle line:84%
So when things are
in a solidified,

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.916 align:middle line:84%
seemingly, here it is,
solid, you can knock on it--

00:07:33.916 --> 00:07:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is what
you call "classical?"

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.742 align:middle line:90%
So the classical logic--

00:07:38.742 --> 00:07:39.700 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's go into that.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.470 align:middle line:90%
That's material realism.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.780 align:middle line:84%
That's where you say,
only matter matters.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.030 align:middle line:84%
You only have a local
effect on things.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.190 align:middle line:84%
The observer, as we
know through science,

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.830 align:middle line:84%
you can conduct an
experiment and fully expect

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.450 align:middle line:84%
that you'll get the
same outcome even

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.232 align:middle line:90%
when you repeat the experiment.

00:07:54.232 --> 00:07:55.690 align:middle line:84%
But now, we're
hearing that there's

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.510 align:middle line:84%
a reproducibility crisis
and scientists are not

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.690 align:middle line:84%
able to reproduce
their experiments.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.040 align:middle line:84%
But these are old assumptions
from the classical way

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.970 align:middle line:90%
of thinking.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.760 align:middle line:84%
We have Boolean logic
with true and false.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.509 align:middle line:84%
But with quantum,
then it's much more--

00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:09.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True and false.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.716 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yes, true and
false-- not true, not false.

00:08:11.716 --> 00:08:14.230 align:middle line:84%
So you're in a much bigger
field of possibility.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.630 align:middle line:90%
And all of these things--

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.100 align:middle line:90%
it also includes entanglement.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.370 align:middle line:84%
So this is where we get into
the way we think as humans.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.600 align:middle line:90%
So if we're given a test--

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.170 align:middle line:84%
psychologists love to give
people tests to find out,

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.080 align:middle line:90%
how do we think?

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you use regular
classical logic and you do the--

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:35.570 align:middle line:90%
I forget.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.710 align:middle line:90%
It's the prisoner dilemma.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:37.809 align:middle line:90%
Have you heard about this?

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:38.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell me.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:39.886 align:middle line:90%
Refresh me if I don't know.

00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: OK, two
people like you

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.049 align:middle line:84%
and I are arrested
and apprehended.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:45.700 align:middle line:84%
This is in an
artificial situation.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.170 align:middle line:90%
So we're not really arrested.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.560 align:middle line:90%
It's make believe.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.820 align:middle line:84%
But we're told
separately, we're informed

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:56.590 align:middle line:84%
that if I rat you out and,
basically, say something,

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.650 align:middle line:84%
then I'll be set
free, and you'll get

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.990 align:middle line:90%
the full penalty of whatever.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And same thing they
tell you, and we

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.810 align:middle line:90%
can't talk to each other.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.880 align:middle line:84%
But if we're also told that if
we both don't reveal anything,

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.350 align:middle line:90%
they'll let both of us go.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.930 align:middle line:84%
There's no reward, but there's
no penalty for either of us.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Classical
logic expects

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:21.400 align:middle line:84%
that 10% of the time, people
would be doing the noble thing

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and saying, like, I'm not
going to say anything.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.230 align:middle line:84%
But actually, what
happens is 40%

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:29.352 align:middle line:84%
of the time the experimental
subjects both decide

00:09:29.352 --> 00:09:31.060 align:middle line:84%
independently of each
other, because they

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.410 align:middle line:90%
can't talk to each other--

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To rat each other out?

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:34.684 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: But
they're not going to.

00:09:34.684 --> 00:09:35.890 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to say anything.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.150 align:middle line:90%
They're not going for the reward

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It's not worth it.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.440 align:middle line:84%
They're just saying, I'm
not going to say anything.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.330 align:middle line:90%
The book might get thrown at me.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:44.390 align:middle line:90%
I'll get locked up.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:45.650 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not going to do that.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:46.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to--

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:47.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, no,
that makes sense.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:47.995 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:09:47.995 --> 00:09:48.828 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Of course.

00:09:48.828 --> 00:09:50.050 align:middle line:90%
It's human sense.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.010 align:middle line:90%
That's what I would do.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: But
that's not expected

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:54.940 align:middle line:90%
through classical logic.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So we're in a
classical logic world.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.820 align:middle line:90%
This does relate to money.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Because I think our
concept of money

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.350 align:middle line:84%
often gets mired down with
these old, out-of-date ideas

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:10.030 align:middle line:84%
from, basically, classical
physics and material realism.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And now what we're learning,
thanks to quantum physics

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:17.620 align:middle line:84%
and quantum logic, is that
we have a much more human way

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.440 align:middle line:90%
of doing things.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.450 align:middle line:84%
We can collaborate
with each other.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.910 align:middle line:84%
We can recognize that even
though we're separated,

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:26.030 align:middle line:84%
we're not talking to each
other, but we are connected.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And we can work in cahoots, even
though there's no connection,

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.780 align:middle line:84%
no official communication
needs to happen,

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.860 align:middle line:84%
but we're still
working together.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:90%
And this is big.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.370 align:middle line:84%
With that said, let's
talk about how these--

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:45.140 align:middle line:84%
what we consider these
anomalies occur, such

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:49.640 align:middle line:84%
as I talked about the earring
was gone, and it reappears.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.180 align:middle line:90%
Money's gone or it just appears.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.890 align:middle line:90%
People say, this isn't possible.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:56.240 align:middle line:90%
How is this possible?

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, as a quantum
physicist, explain to us

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.730 align:middle line:90%
how this is actually working.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:03.350 align:middle line:84%
Because we've been
raised in the world

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:05.720 align:middle line:84%
of scientific
materialism, people

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.240 align:middle line:84%
need some kind of validation
that this principle-- even

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.115 align:middle line:84%
just the principle, even
if you can't see it,

00:11:10.115 --> 00:11:12.930 align:middle line:84%
actually works so they can
buy into the rest of the story

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:13.730 align:middle line:90%
oftentimes.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, one principle
that helps clarify it

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.210 align:middle line:84%
is the quantum
superposition concept.

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is, it's gaining
ground among scientific circles.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.270 align:middle line:84%
So more and more
physicists agree

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.570 align:middle line:84%
that you, and I, and
everyone, and everything

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.264 align:middle line:84%
exists in a superposition
of states, which means--

00:11:32.264 --> 00:11:33.847 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And explain
what that means.

00:11:33.847 --> 00:11:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Ha-ha, yes.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:35.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, within just
regular physics,

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:42.530 align:middle line:84%
that means that a particle would
be either spin up or spin down,

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.230 align:middle line:84%
but it can be actually
both-- spin up and spin down.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Its in a superposition
of states.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.030 align:middle line:84%
What it feels like is you're
flipped a coin in the air,

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.117 align:middle line:90%
and it's just spinning.

00:11:51.117 --> 00:11:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's in a
field of possibility.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Field of possibility.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
only a possibility.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's right.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So everything we
are sitting here right now,

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:59.825 align:middle line:84%
we can go any
number of direction.

00:11:59.825 --> 00:12:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's right.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.715 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
it's all possibility.

00:12:01.715 --> 00:12:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Exactly.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just that
through whatever dynamic that

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:08.212 align:middle line:84%
has been set into motion, here
we are talking in this moment.

00:12:08.212 --> 00:12:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's right.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And so some of the
current scientists who

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:14.300 align:middle line:84%
are looking at the way
we think, our cognition,

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.990 align:middle line:84%
they're finding that our
cognitive processes definitely

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.850 align:middle line:90%
model quantum ones.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:24.450 align:middle line:84%
So that means we're able to
be entangled with one another,

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.530 align:middle line:84%
to consider relationships
that matter to us instead

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.990 align:middle line:84%
of just thinking of
everything like a robot would.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:31.670 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Which we're kind of headed
toward on some levels,

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.760 align:middle line:90%
it sounds like.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.235 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:35.235 --> 00:12:37.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: So the good news
is, with the superposition

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.400 align:middle line:84%
of states, we're capable,
then, of recognizing

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.070 align:middle line:84%
that there's always
that path less traveled,

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:44.300 align:middle line:90%
but we can take it.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.580 align:middle line:84%
We can take that
path less traveled.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.120 align:middle line:90%
We can go a different way.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we have the
superposition, right?

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.024 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:12:53.024 --> 00:12:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything
is in a state

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.830 align:middle line:84%
of possibility or potential,
up or down, right?

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What is
it that ultimately

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:04.369 align:middle line:84%
drives the up or down
button in a given moment?

00:13:04.369 --> 00:13:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And then, we're
back at consciousness--

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: --and the observer.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:10.760 align:middle line:90%
And this is a very big idea.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.580 align:middle line:84%
We think we know what
"observer" means,

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.650 align:middle line:84%
but we often don't realize
just how big it really is.

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Because we are entangled
with one another.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.570 align:middle line:84%
We're a part of our
family way of thinking.

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:25.370 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to money, we
might be, without realizing it,

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.850 align:middle line:84%
playing out some of the
very same energy patterns

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.250 align:middle line:84%
that we've seen modeled
in our childhood.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:32.721 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
and on that model,

00:13:32.721 --> 00:13:34.220 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about
with the observer--

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.960 align:middle line:84%
because many of the
people viewing this

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.300 align:middle line:84%
have read books on
quantum physics.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And they understand more from
a classical point of view

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:43.130 align:middle line:84%
what the observer means
in a strict experiment.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.460 align:middle line:84%
So maybe start from there
to the nuanced version

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.600 align:middle line:84%
of what an observer actually
is in our total reality.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Gotcha.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.170 align:middle line:90%
This is big.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:51.650 align:middle line:90%
This is huge.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:55.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: OK, so starting with
the double-slit experiment--

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:56.670 align:middle line:90%
let's start there.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So this is for someone
who doesn't know anything

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:02.732 align:middle line:84%
about this strange quality
of quantum particles.

00:14:02.732 --> 00:14:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm using the word
"particles" with quotes on it.

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
it could be a wave.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.575 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It could
be a particle.

00:14:07.575 --> 00:14:10.280 align:middle line:10%
>>LARSON: And this experiment,
which was originally designed

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.875 align:middle line:10%
by [INAUDIBLE], was found--

00:14:12.875 --> 00:14:14.330 align:middle line:10%
I'll describe the apparatus.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:18.720 align:middle line:84%
It involves one observer who
is watching particles of light,

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.720 align:middle line:84%
for example,
photons, that can go

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.060 align:middle line:84%
through either one
or another slit

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and then land on a
screen in the background.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:29.330 align:middle line:84%
So as the photons are flying--
they're coming through--

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.420 align:middle line:84%
so it's like being emitted
from a particle emitter going

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.450 align:middle line:84%
through one of two little slits
and then landing on a screen.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, the physicists expected,
when they ran the experiment,

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:43.790 align:middle line:84%
was that there would be a
particle nature of the photon--

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:46.790 align:middle line:84%
that it would just go through
whichever slit it went through

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:50.180 align:middle line:84%
and leave a little splat
right there behind the slit.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:54.770 align:middle line:84%
But instead, they can just be
emitting, even a single photon,

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.500 align:middle line:84%
seems to interfere
with itself and create

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.080 align:middle line:84%
kind of a wave pattern
on the screen, which

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.300 align:middle line:84%
is like if you throw
two pebbles in a pond,

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.530 align:middle line:84%
you get concentric ripples
that interfere with each other.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:06.385 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:06.385 --> 00:15:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Destructive and
constructive interference

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:09.360 align:middle line:90%
pattern.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.290 align:middle line:84%
So this is the observer effect
because when the observer then

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.890 align:middle line:84%
chooses to start monitoring, OK,
I'm going to find out exactly

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.280 align:middle line:84%
which of these two slits
that photon went through,

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.680 align:middle line:84%
I'll put a particle
detector on that slit.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Then, you'll get a result.
It's as if the photon

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.030 align:middle line:90%
knows what you're doing.

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, it
looks like paintball,

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.780 align:middle line:84%
and you've got a little
pattern of splats

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.149 align:middle line:90%
right behind that slit.

00:15:32.149 --> 00:15:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's interfacing
with the consciousness

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:34.990 align:middle line:90%
of the observer.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And so then, now, let's move
on to Schrodinger's cat--

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.694 align:middle line:90%
take a look at that.

00:15:40.694 --> 00:15:42.110 align:middle line:84%
This is a hypothetical
experiment.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Because Schrodinger
was a physicist who

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.260 align:middle line:84%
was wondering what
would happen if you

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.450 align:middle line:84%
take this situation
with quantum physics

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.400 align:middle line:84%
and take it to the
classical level.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.374 align:middle line:84%
And he felt like it becomes
ridiculous very quickly.

00:15:55.374 --> 00:15:56.540 align:middle line:90%
He said, this is ridiculous.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Because if you've got
radioactive material that's

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:02.350 align:middle line:84%
randomly deciding
when it's going

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:06.410 align:middle line:84%
to trigger a little mechanism
to break a glass vial of poison

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:84%
inside of a little sealed
compartment that a cat is in,

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.230 align:middle line:84%
what you're saying is the
cat is both alive and dead.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:90%
And that can't be.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.406 align:middle line:90%
That was what he was saying.

00:16:15.406 --> 00:16:17.219 align:middle line:84%
He said, this is
really ridiculous.

00:16:17.219 --> 00:16:19.010 align:middle line:84%
But that is what quantum
physics is saying.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.040 align:middle line:90%
This is exactly it--

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.410 align:middle line:84%
that we are putting that cat
in the state of superposition.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And until that moment that
you actually open the box

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and take a look, it
is alive and dead.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:31.280 align:middle line:90%
It's like, it's everything.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.750 align:middle line:90%
It's in a field of possibility.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.130 align:middle line:84%
So now, we'll just
talk about a fun thing.

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yeah.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So one of the
examples you used in your book--

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.256 align:middle line:84%
before we get into
the rest of it.

00:16:40.256 --> 00:16:43.510 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the story
you tell us a little kid,

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:45.616 align:middle line:90%
you printed money.

00:16:45.616 --> 00:16:47.990 align:middle line:84%
You were like the neighborhood
banker for the other kids.

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: So much fun--

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:50.820 align:middle line:90%
just to play.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there
was this one example

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:56.366 align:middle line:84%
you used in your book of a
woman who had a child with them,

00:16:56.366 --> 00:16:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't
have enough money

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.400 align:middle line:84%
to put a tip down as I recall
or something like that.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: That was
me with my daughter.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, was that you?

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.060 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know it was you.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.069 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was someone else.

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Actually,
this happened.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:05.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes!

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so you didn't have
enough to do the full tip you

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:08.880 align:middle line:90%
wanted to do, right?

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.599 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right, right.

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:11.015 align:middle line:84%
Because I wanted
to pay with cash,

00:17:11.015 --> 00:17:13.280 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't quite bring
enough cash for the tip.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.394 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, oh, gosh,
but my daughters--

00:17:15.394 --> 00:17:17.310 align:middle line:84%
they've been growing up
with this whole thing,

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.990 align:middle line:84%
so they're quite used to
me talking about this.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.790 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:21.619 align:middle line:90%
So perfect.

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:23.180 align:middle line:90%
Kids are perfect anyway--

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.520 align:middle line:90%
but my kids doubly so.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.030 align:middle line:90%
They're like really perfect.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.821 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know this
was going to happen.

00:17:27.821 --> 00:17:31.160 align:middle line:84%
So what happened next is I
looked at both of my daughters.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, you know what,
I think I'll shut my wallet,

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.110 align:middle line:84%
and I'll open it again,
and we'll look again.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we'll find
another $1 bill.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Because I just
pulled out a $1 bill.

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:43.172 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, there
was another $1 bill.

00:17:43.172 --> 00:17:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And they both squealed with
excitement and happiness.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.250 align:middle line:90%
Yay!

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:48.620 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I'm
going to shut it again.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:49.420 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:52.045 align:middle line:84%
Should we try to see if we open
it and get another dollar bill?

00:17:52.045 --> 00:17:53.060 align:middle line:90%
They said, yes!

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept
pulling $1 bill--

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.060 align:middle line:90%
it was like a magic trick--

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.630 align:middle line:84%
after $1 bill, after $1
bill out of that wallet.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.610 align:middle line:90%
So yes, this can happen.

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:02.495 align:middle line:90%
It's happened to me.

00:18:02.495 --> 00:18:04.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.280 align:middle line:90%
I love that story.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yeah.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.539 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
looks like magic--

00:18:08.539 --> 00:18:09.338 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It does.

00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But it's not.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It's the real thing.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:12.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:13.550 align:middle line:90%
There were no $1 bills.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:14.330 align:middle line:90%
It was an empty wallet--

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Manifested
in a physical sense,

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:16.340 align:middle line:90%
it was a wallet.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:18.673 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So are you
saying that there

00:18:18.673 --> 00:18:22.280 align:middle line:84%
was a coalescence
of information that

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.200 align:middle line:90%
created a physical substance?

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.430 align:middle line:90%
Or did it jump time lines?

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well, that's
a good question.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it seems
like it's that--

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.200 align:middle line:90%
you call it "jump timelines."

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's just
recognizing that there can

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.040 align:middle line:90%
be a superposition of states.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.200 align:middle line:84%
My wallet can be in
a state where there's

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.120 align:middle line:90%
yet one more dollar bill here.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.590 align:middle line:90%
And OK, there's one more.

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:43.990 align:middle line:90%
OK, there's one more.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:45.769 align:middle line:84%
And just one at a
time until I get

00:18:45.769 --> 00:18:47.060 align:middle line:90%
the correct amount for the tip.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and this is the
part where people's minds are

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.830 align:middle line:84%
like, yeah, but did it just
like create itself suddenly

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:52.647 align:middle line:90%
inside your wallet?

00:18:52.647 --> 00:18:53.730 align:middle line:90%
How did it even get there?

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: You're
thinking too much.

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:55.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.410 align:middle line:84%
But that's what
it's like, right?

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It's a good question.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:58.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:59.510 align:middle line:84%
That's the part
that stumps people

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.110 align:middle line:90%
is, do you just kind of--

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:04.370 align:middle line:84%
are you just shifting to another
time frame of possibility--

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.434 align:middle line:84%
or just another
possibility, forget time.

00:19:06.434 --> 00:19:07.850 align:middle line:84%
Because time is
irrelevant, right?

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:08.390 align:middle line:90%
Right, right.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well, I do
see it as shifting

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.070 align:middle line:90%
to another possibility.

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.294 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And I do
feel like it happens

00:19:12.294 --> 00:19:13.610 align:middle line:90%
best when you're having fun.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Like, I was in a perfect
mood when that was happening.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:16.880 align:middle line:90%
That really does help.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Because all the
best stuff happens

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.690 align:middle line:84%
when you're feeling grateful
and you're just feeling happy.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It can.

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Back to the very beginning
of the conversation,

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.020 align:middle line:90%
you were happy.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:25.820 align:middle line:90%
It was playful.

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:26.700 align:middle line:90%
It was fun.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.990 align:middle line:90%
It was exciting for your kids.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:31.550 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
very positive, loving

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:35.030 align:middle line:84%
emotional energy that went
into that-- that exciting

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:35.831 align:middle line:90%
expectation.

00:19:35.831 --> 00:19:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so this
has also happened

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:40.550 align:middle line:84%
when you were excited
about going on a vacation

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:42.570 align:middle line:84%
and you were about
$1,000 short as I recall.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Ah, that
was a good one This

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:44.690 align:middle line:90%
has happened a couple of times.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Recently, it happened again.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:47.662 align:middle line:90%
That was-- yes.

00:19:47.662 --> 00:19:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're talking about the
rising tide lifting all ships.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.112 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:51.112 --> 00:19:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Because I thought,
well, I'll go on this vacation

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.630 align:middle line:84%
if I had $1,000 extra,
but otherwise, this

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.000 align:middle line:84%
can't happen because
I've got to be practical.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.400 align:middle line:84%
I've got to cover
expenses and so forth--

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.269 align:middle line:84%
you know, the regular,
day-to-day mindset

00:20:03.269 --> 00:20:04.310 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:07.281 align:middle line:84%
But I thought if it should
happen, that would be great.

00:20:07.281 --> 00:20:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I kept
being in that, that

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.310 align:middle line:90%
would be great state of mind.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure that had everything
to do with it-- just feeling,

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.050 align:middle line:90%
because that's the key.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:18.020 align:middle line:84%
If I were to feel worried
about it, like, oh gosh--

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm not going
to get an extra $1,000.

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:24.160 align:middle line:84%
If I was in that mindset,
and there's a whole bunch--

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.070 align:middle line:90%
there's a lot to it.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:middle line:90%
It's not just your mindset.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:26.890 align:middle line:90%
It's your heartset.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:27.760 align:middle line:90%
It's your gutset.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.450 align:middle line:84%
It's all of you, which I get
into in "High Energy Money--"

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle line:84%
all the levels
that we think with.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And so you had money
show up in your bank

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.185 align:middle line:84%
account, just
digits on a screen.

00:20:38.185 --> 00:20:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Hey, people on Wall
Street do it every day.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's right.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.193 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --manipulate
digits on the screen.

00:20:42.193 --> 00:20:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes, they do.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They do.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.400 align:middle line:84%
But you're doing it in
a little different way.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.737 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:48.737 --> 00:20:51.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Again, it just looked
like it had always been there.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.954 align:middle line:84%
So I was tracking
back like there--

00:20:52.954 --> 00:20:55.120 align:middle line:84%
I thought the same thing
that you mentioned earlier.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.797 align:middle line:84%
This could have
been a bank error.

00:20:56.797 --> 00:20:57.880 align:middle line:90%
I used to work for a bank.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.410 align:middle line:90%
So I'm looking closely.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:00.830 align:middle line:90%
When did this happen?

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, I know when
I didn't have it.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.370 align:middle line:90%
Now I know when I do have it.

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at
everything in between.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.070 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back farther.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:07.250 align:middle line:90%
It was always there.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.210 align:middle line:90%
What the heck?

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:10.297 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:10.297 --> 00:21:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, if we stop
talking at this moment,

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.550 align:middle line:84%
people would be left
with, really, more

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:19.630 align:middle line:84%
than we can take in on
just a left-brain level.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:22.280 align:middle line:84%
We have to open ourselves
up to that possibility.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.106 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
all the ways in which--

00:21:24.106 --> 00:21:25.730 align:middle line:84%
you were talking
about the body works--

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:27.841 align:middle line:84%
the brain, body,
heart matrix work.

00:21:27.841 --> 00:21:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well, when
we think about money,

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:31.120 align:middle line:90%
we tend to get up in our heads.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And then, we neglect how we're
actually feeling about it.

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:38.030 align:middle line:84%
We neglect our gut feelings
about what we really need.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.690 align:middle line:84%
So when you've got money,
you tend to be in your head,

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.750 align:middle line:84%
and you tend to be thinking
about what you think you need.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.660 align:middle line:84%
But that kind of mindset
is not fully balanced,

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.110 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't tend to
produce the best results.

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:51.520 align:middle line:84%
It tends to leave
people feeling like they

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.479 align:middle line:84%
didn't get what they wanted and
they don't have what they need.

00:21:54.479 --> 00:21:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Even if they get
all that money, this

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.460 align:middle line:84%
is where you get
millionaires that

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.700 align:middle line:84%
feel like they're poor because
someone has more than they do.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like J. Paul
Getty, that film--

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.220 align:middle line:84%
that was one of
the saddest things.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: So said.

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When someone
said, how much is enough?

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:10.150 align:middle line:90%
This is your grandson.

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Can't you put the ransom
up for your grandson?

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And the man said,
how much is enough?

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:16.780 align:middle line:90%
And he said, never.

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.430 align:middle line:90%
There's never enough.

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And that was-- he was
considered one of the wealthiest

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.000 align:middle line:90%
men in the world.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.750 align:middle line:90%
That's a different mindset.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:26.964 align:middle line:84%
He did accumulate wealth, but
what a sadness associated it--

00:22:26.964 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: There's
a tragedy there.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel
it, you can see it.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:32.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's out-of-balance
condition.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:33.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And so you're in
balance when what you need,

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.500 align:middle line:84%
and what you want, and what
you think that you are going

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.700 align:middle line:90%
after--

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.160 align:middle line:84%
you're bringing
it all together--

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:41.930 align:middle line:84%
you've got your
feelings together.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:43.013 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To be satisfied.

00:22:43.013 --> 00:22:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yes, you're
all of one piece.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's often not the case
with money for a lot of people.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:52.030 align:middle line:84%
We tend to get
tangled up, and we

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:55.060 align:middle line:84%
take our feelings about money
and sort of contort them

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.260 align:middle line:90%
and twist them.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.870 align:middle line:84%
So this is a process of
untwisting it and getting

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:00.410 align:middle line:90%
it straightened out again.

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:02.350 align:middle line:84%
So money is just
something-- it's

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:04.360 align:middle line:84%
another form of
energy, something

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.900 align:middle line:90%
you can enjoy, have fun with.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.199 align:middle line:84%
Instead of letting
it go all the way

00:23:08.199 --> 00:23:10.780 align:middle line:84%
down to a physiological
level, where people actually

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.070 align:middle line:90%
lose their health over money.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: They do.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:13.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It can go into,
really, an organic--

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:17.280 align:middle line:90%
into your organs themselves.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.259 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:23:18.259 --> 00:23:20.300 align:middle line:84%
But it's not so much the
money that's doing that.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:21.466 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's the fear.

00:23:21.466 --> 00:23:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Right, its the
people's reaction, too--

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.030 align:middle line:90%
what they perceive.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And I wish people could just
detach from that and realize,

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.200 align:middle line:90%
you're OK.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.660 align:middle line:90%
You're fine just as you are.

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Everything's fine.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and as you say,
and this is called "High Energy

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Money" because it requires high
frequencies within yourself

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:44.420 align:middle line:84%
to be able to manifest the
things that you're desiring,

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.220 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.451 align:middle line:84%
And also, the key is
stepping back and observing

00:23:48.451 --> 00:23:49.700 align:middle line:90%
that you're not your thoughts.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.010 align:middle line:90%
You're not your feelings.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:55.040 align:middle line:84%
This also gets to the next step
after the Schrodinger cat box,

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.070 align:middle line:84%
which is, when you've
got an observer observing

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.250 align:middle line:84%
the observer, then you've
got an entangled system.

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And this gets into some big
stuff about entanglement,

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:05.740 align:middle line:84%
but it's the key
to why people find

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.690 align:middle line:84%
sometimes law of
attraction doesn't work

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:09.220 align:middle line:90%
or they think it doesn't work.

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And this relates to
how well-connected

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:14.650 align:middle line:84%
and how those
connections you have

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:17.470 align:middle line:84%
with your family, with
their thought patterns,

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:21.190 align:middle line:84%
your colleagues, their thought
patterns, your friends,

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:24.270 align:middle line:84%
their thought patterns-- it's
all going to have an effect.

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:26.650 align:middle line:84%
But you need to step
back from that in order

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.560 align:middle line:84%
to really be at peace with
the whole thing, whatever

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.630 align:middle line:90%
it is-- in this case, money.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is so true.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Because whatever resonant
field you're projecting

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:38.890 align:middle line:84%
is going to become
entangled with

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:42.410 align:middle line:84%
or go into resonance with
the like in someone else.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's why you can
have it where someone becomes

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.977 align:middle line:90%
the skunk at the picnic.

00:24:48.977 --> 00:24:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's having a
good time, someone

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.380 align:middle line:84%
comes in furious,
angry, bitter, and just

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.000 align:middle line:84%
can drop a bomb in
the middle of it

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and entangle everybody else's
field because it's lowering,

00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.710 align:middle line:84%
the shock is
lowering their fields

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:01.960 align:middle line:84%
to where you're all on
the same level suddenly.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I to go home early.

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:05.870 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't feel good anymore.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:08.500 align:middle line:90%
And this happens in minor ways.

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Really, almost
minute by minute, it

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:11.980 align:middle line:84%
can be as we're
walking through life.

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:12.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't know
who you're standing next to,

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.407 align:middle line:84%
and they can take you
high as a kite, too.

00:25:17.407 --> 00:25:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yeah, and you
notice that at the picnic.

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:20.864 align:middle line:84%
But what you don't
tend to notice

00:25:20.864 --> 00:25:23.300 align:middle line:84%
is when it's just-- you
think it's just you,

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.352 align:middle line:90%
but it's never just you.

00:25:24.352 --> 00:25:25.310 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm saying.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:26.660 align:middle line:90%
It's never just you.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.881 align:middle line:84%
It's always everybody that
you're connected with.

00:25:28.881 --> 00:25:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And all those thought patterns
and the way all of that

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:33.770 align:middle line:84%
is moving together,
you need to step back

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:36.200 align:middle line:84%
from that to really be
an observer of that.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.180 align:middle line:90%
And when we do that, then--

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:84%
and you feel grateful,
and recognize

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:43.440 align:middle line:84%
that you are consciousness,
miracles happen, basically.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens when
you get into a situation,

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:51.080 align:middle line:84%
say, where you're from a
family, where money is God?

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Get your degree so you can
earn the most amount of money,

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes the guiding,
godlike force in your life.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.500 align:middle line:84%
In that situation, oftentimes
people like J. Paul Getty

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:07.700 align:middle line:84%
can draw a lot of money
to them through a lot

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.830 align:middle line:84%
of left-brain
processes and so forth.

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.960 align:middle line:84%
But still, something
doesn't feel good about it.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a flaw in the
system, the process.

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:19.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Right, This is
the lack of full integrity.

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:22.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not integrating
everything in the being.

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:26.090 align:middle line:84%
So this is where it leads to
just all kinds of problems.

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:28.240 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know this
individual, so I don't want

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.490 align:middle line:90%
to say anything bad about him.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:31.615 align:middle line:84%
But it sounds to me-- and
I haven't seen the movie.

00:26:31.615 --> 00:26:32.540 align:middle line:90%
But I do know--

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:34.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm familiar with
the history of it.

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:35.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well, I
think most of us are.

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This was
the J. Paul Getty?

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then the
kidnapping of his grandson.

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:40.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: So great
prosperity of that nature

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:44.880 align:middle line:84%
can attract negative
events sometimes.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And then how we move
through that is--

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm not judging him.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:50.084 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah, no.

00:26:50.084 --> 00:26:52.250 align:middle line:84%
He said he felt like the
loneliest man in the world.

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because everybody
wanted something from him.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:55.910 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:57.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet there was
never even enough for himself

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:58.610 align:middle line:90%
in his own mind.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Exactly.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.210 align:middle line:84%
So this is the problem
that can occur,

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's important,
therefore, to be balanced,

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.700 align:middle line:90%
to look within yourself.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:08.810 align:middle line:90%
What do you actually need?

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do
you actually want--

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.567 align:middle line:90%
and need, right, exactly.

00:27:11.567 --> 00:27:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And what are
you actually feeling?

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And so you need to integrate
all those levels together.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.090 align:middle line:90%
Then, everything clicks.

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.149 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's start back for
just a minute because it's so

00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:21.830 align:middle line:84%
fun what you learned
as a little kid

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:24.416 align:middle line:90%
when you were printing money.

00:27:24.416 --> 00:27:26.225 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well,
that was a blast.

00:27:26.225 --> 00:27:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No kidding.

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.810 align:middle line:84%
But you learn some things,
which obviously helped

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.320 align:middle line:90%
you and your future trajectory.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yeah, well,
it was interesting,

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.880 align:middle line:90%
because I would be just--

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.430 align:middle line:84%
what happened-- I should back
up a little bit and explain--

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.140 align:middle line:84%
the children in the
neighborhood would--

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.320 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to make things
and barter but some of that

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.770 align:middle line:90%
wasn't working too well.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:45.890 align:middle line:84%
So one child might
bring crackers,

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.230 align:middle line:84%
and another one would
bring some lemonade

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:50.750 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, yet a third
one would bring something

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:51.980 align:middle line:90%
that they'd made.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:53.156 align:middle line:90%
And they wanted to--

00:27:53.156 --> 00:27:54.530 align:middle line:84%
it was like a
little marketplace.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.100 align:middle line:90%
And it was so much fun.

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.760 align:middle line:84%
But I noticed that it would
be helpful to have money.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, well, I can
just print money, and hand this

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:04.700 align:middle line:84%
out, and people can then
make their exchanges better.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.442 align:middle line:84%
But then, I was
also becoming a bank

00:28:06.442 --> 00:28:08.150 align:middle line:84%
because they weren't
very good at keeping

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:08.950 align:middle line:90%
track of their money.

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:10.220 align:middle line:84%
It was all going
all over the place.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But well,
now-- what gave you

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:13.070 align:middle line:84%
the idea-- they
couldn't just exchange

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:14.510 align:middle line:90%
a cracker for lemonade.

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:15.800 align:middle line:90%
Why did they need the money?

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.882 align:middle line:84%
Why did you perceive they
needed this interim thing?

00:28:18.882 --> 00:28:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Because sometimes--

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:21.214 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Unit of exchange.

00:28:21.214 --> 00:28:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yeah, because
sometimes they didn't like--

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.060 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to be a
middleman in something.

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.650 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember
the example exactly.

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:29.880 align:middle line:84%
But they might have
yarn and someone else

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.395 align:middle line:84%
is making the yarn
into something.

00:28:33.395 --> 00:28:35.900 align:middle line:84%
It becomes easier to
have the money than--

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Trying to figure out
these bartering arrangements.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yeah, and
I'll take that cracker,

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:40.790 align:middle line:84%
but I need to give
the yarn to them.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:43.100 align:middle line:90%
But this isn't fair.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.514 align:middle line:84%
I can't let go of the yarn,
but that person needs it.

00:28:45.514 --> 00:28:46.805 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and I'm hungry.

00:28:46.805 --> 00:28:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: And I'm hungry.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.410 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And so little scuffles
would break out.

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, if we have
money, we can resolve that.

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.879 align:middle line:84%
We can just agree
that this is working.

00:28:55.879 --> 00:28:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How old were
you about this time?

00:28:57.670 --> 00:28:59.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Maybe eight or nine.

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:00.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, something like that.

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:01.550 align:middle line:90%
It was fun.

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
created the money.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And then, what did you notice
the effect of that was?

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well, it was
interesting because people

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.440 align:middle line:90%
seemed to--

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.550 align:middle line:90%
lots of things happened.

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:12.470 align:middle line:84%
They seemed to need,
like, more and more.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:14.842 align:middle line:90%
And that was weird.

00:29:14.842 --> 00:29:16.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
suddenly, they need more?

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:17.330 align:middle line:90%
They were fine before.

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yeah, they
were fine before.

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:19.911 align:middle line:90%
But now, they need their money.

00:29:19.911 --> 00:29:21.320 align:middle line:90%
That was one observation.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to remember
what I wrote in the book.

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:25.055 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As the banker, you
were making money off of it?

00:29:25.055 --> 00:29:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:26.540 align:middle line:90%
And I felt weird.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:27.830 align:middle line:84%
I felt like this is kind
of-- there's something

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:28.880 align:middle line:90%
wrong about this.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.963 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you can
print as much as you want.

00:29:30.963 --> 00:29:31.950 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: I know!

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:34.720 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I was kind of like the
National Reserve or something--

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.540 align:middle line:90%
the treasury.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Federal Reserve.

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:37.188 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It was weird.

00:29:37.188 --> 00:29:39.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes, the Federal Reserve.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.300 align:middle line:84%
I started feeling a
little bit ethically off.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to
walk away from it.

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:45.030 align:middle line:84%
But people felt like,
no, you're the banker.

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh boy, how did I
end up in this position?

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:51.950 align:middle line:90%
How did that experiment end?

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:53.060 align:middle line:90%
You just grew up or what?

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yeah, I grew up.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.409 align:middle line:84%
It was a summer thing,
so school started.

00:29:57.409 --> 00:29:58.700 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't bring it up again.

00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:59.701 align:middle line:90%
Let's not do that again.

00:29:59.701 --> 00:30:01.241 align:middle line:84%
Because I get stuck
being the banker.

00:30:01.241 --> 00:30:02.370 align:middle line:90%
It was fun while it lasted.

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, it's interesting
because the need, the desire,

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:09.849 align:middle line:84%
abundance was creating a
need for more abundance.

00:30:09.849 --> 00:30:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That was weird.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was psychologically
growing on itself, I need more.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With little kids,
unconscious of these dynamics.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: That was
weird to see that.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Right, it wasn't like
full-blown experiment.

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:21.030 align:middle line:84%
We're talking just
a few children here

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:21.863 align:middle line:90%
in the neighborhood.

00:30:21.863 --> 00:30:23.490 align:middle line:90%
But absolutely.

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:25.650 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like people
felt an intrinsic need

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:26.790 align:middle line:90%
that, I need more.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:28.860 align:middle line:84%
If I've got this, you
need to print more money.

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.110 align:middle line:90%
That's the part I didn't like.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:31.470 align:middle line:84%
Like, why am I printing
all this money?

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Why do
we need so much?

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:35.820 align:middle line:84%
No, I thought it was
very interesting because

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.340 align:middle line:84%
from the mouths of babes,
it turns into a dynamic

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:39.930 align:middle line:90%
that happens as adults as well.

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's true.

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
between governments

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.725 align:middle line:84%
and on larger and corporate
levels and so forth.

00:30:43.725 --> 00:30:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And it's not
addressed in our schools.

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:46.560 align:middle line:90%
We don't get into any of that.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.851 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We don't get into it.

00:30:47.851 --> 00:30:50.880 align:middle line:84%
So one of the questions
along the way in your book

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:57.200 align:middle line:84%
that you suggest we posed to
ourselves is how good can life

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.000 align:middle line:90%
get?

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you look
at it and think, oh,

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:04.750 align:middle line:84%
well that's a nice, little
new-age mantra or whatever.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And you can look at it
that way as just something

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.810 align:middle line:84%
simple like that and
just, yeah, right, right.

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:13.800 align:middle line:84%
But if you actually engage with
the energy of that sentence,

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.225 align:middle line:84%
it brings up
everything inside you.

00:31:16.225 --> 00:31:17.025 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:31:17.025 --> 00:31:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It brings up your
imagination, creativity,

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:24.690 align:middle line:90%
limitation, fear--

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:27.150 align:middle line:84%
definitely, like I
said, the limitations

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:30.600 align:middle line:84%
we put on ourselves, the
boxes we have put ourselves.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.700 align:middle line:90%
And so I found it--

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.700 align:middle line:84%
I just loved just
sitting down and playing

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.410 align:middle line:84%
with that notion
for a little bit

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:41.130 align:middle line:84%
to see all of the areas of
the psyche and the emotions

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:42.690 align:middle line:90%
that it activates.

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:45.130 align:middle line:90%
So tell us about that.

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well, for me,
this is the key that

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.740 align:middle line:84%
goes hand-in-hand with
our identity, who we are,

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:52.170 align:middle line:84%
and that ability to step
back, not be the thoughts,

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:55.200 align:middle line:84%
not be the feelings, just
always being the observer,

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.846 align:middle line:84%
being the ultimate observer
as much as possible.

00:31:57.846 --> 00:31:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And when you do
that, then you're

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.470 align:middle line:84%
actually exploring
how good it can get.

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:02.910 align:middle line:84%
You're recognizing
that you start

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:06.180 align:middle line:84%
feeling all these other
possibilities that do exist--

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.140 align:middle line:90%
that you don't--

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: If you allow yourself.

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:10.380 align:middle line:84%
It's audacious because
a lot of people

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:14.410 align:middle line:84%
will not allow themselves
to go very far beyond--

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:17.430 align:middle line:84%
like, well, I would love
to pay my car off instead

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:18.300 align:middle line:90%
of making payments.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's about as far, maybe,
as someone's comfortable going.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Because they can't believe
that more is possible-- again,

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:29.260 align:middle line:84%
this restricted thinking that's
often cultural, familial,

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.060 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: But I've seen the
biggest shifts in my life

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:35.940 align:middle line:84%
when I use this open-ended
approach with the combination

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:37.700 align:middle line:90%
of that and gratitude.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Then, you'll see reality
shifts miracles that

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:41.970 align:middle line:90%
are just off-the-charts good.

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And you don't need
to be afraid of them.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.210 align:middle line:90%
That's the other big thing.

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:47.850 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people-- they
feel frightened, like you said.

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:49.030 align:middle line:90%
There's a fear of success.

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:50.730 align:middle line:90%
And, like, what does that mean?

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:53.790 align:middle line:84%
But if you just
recognize that there's

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:55.290 align:middle line:84%
a level of
consciousness, a level

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:56.730 align:middle line:84%
of awareness that
knows what good

00:32:56.730 --> 00:33:01.080 align:middle line:84%
is, that you can co-create
with that ultimate level

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.075 align:middle line:90%
of goodness.

00:33:02.075 --> 00:33:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so that
brings up another conundrum.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:08.520 align:middle line:84%
How do we access what is
true within ourselves then?

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Because someone might say,
OK, the sky's the limit.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.560 align:middle line:84%
I want to have a
mansion in Miami.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.840 align:middle line:84%
I want to have a
mansion in Hawaii.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And you start kind of going
nuts on the material level.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:19.920 align:middle line:90%
That's how good life can get.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: That's what
they think they want.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.651 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They think they want.

00:33:22.651 --> 00:33:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: That's in their head
and great job acting it out.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't feel from that
that's in their heart at all.

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And so this becomes
the other layer

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.490 align:middle line:90%
of answering that question.

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:38.200 align:middle line:84%
After you go through all
the fantasy and everything,

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.190 align:middle line:84%
what do you use
as your mechanism

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:43.920 align:middle line:84%
that you might share with other
people for discerning the truth

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.130 align:middle line:84%
of more the heart than
the mind and its fancies.

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Well, the heart--

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.160 align:middle line:84%
one quick way is
just to recognize

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.640 align:middle line:90%
what matters most to you.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.130 align:middle line:90%
What are you really living for?

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Probably, it's not
that mansion or having

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:58.830 align:middle line:84%
the most money or the
most toys, or any of that.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:02.070 align:middle line:84%
It's probably connections
and relationships with people

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:03.730 align:middle line:90%
that you love, hopefully--

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:07.050 align:middle line:84%
and if not that, then maybe
your pet or something.

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:10.719 align:middle line:84%
And so that dream might
look something like,

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:13.489 align:middle line:84%
oh god, I'd love to take
my whole family on a trip

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:15.030 align:middle line:84%
together somewhere
where we could all

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:16.630 align:middle line:90%
be together for a week, right?

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:16.969 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That might be a
dream that would come out

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:19.409 align:middle line:90%
from the heart, right?

00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:21.284 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yes, that
sounds much more like it.

00:34:21.284 --> 00:34:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
what you did, right?

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Exactly.

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the money
showed up in that case.

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:28.380 align:middle line:84%
We can't say it's going to
happen that way all the time

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:29.239 align:middle line:90%
because there's--

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:31.949 align:middle line:84%
you don't have filters that
other people have, either.

00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:34.230 align:middle line:84%
You've been many, many
years using all of these--

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.275 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:34:34.275 --> 00:34:36.020 align:middle line:84%
This is about 20 years
in on my journey.

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:40.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And the other thing
is need, what you need, and just

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.170 align:middle line:84%
recognize that that greater
sense of goodness knows.

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:45.460 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like recognizing--

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.280 align:middle line:84%
it's observing--
this consciousness

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:52.620 align:middle line:84%
that is the base root of all
that is also aware that you

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:54.449 align:middle line:90%
don't really need 10 mansions.

00:34:54.449 --> 00:34:58.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I wouldn't even be so
silly as to say something like.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.620 align:middle line:90%
If my heart's not in it.

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:00.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't need it.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have
heard people say that.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: I've heard it, too.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
like, wow, OK.

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.750 align:middle line:84%
If it'll float your boat
and make your heart happy,

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:07.950 align:middle line:90%
but then when you--

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:11.190 align:middle line:84%
as soon as you bring up
the word "need," now, we--

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:14.380 align:middle line:90%
equals oftentimes fear.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Because now, we're
in the subconscious.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:20.280 align:middle line:84%
We're getting into areas that
people often don't look at.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.570 align:middle line:90%
These are shadow issues.

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And they may not have addressed
some of their neediness.

00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not OK to
be needy in society,

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:30.720 align:middle line:90%
dare to act out in that way.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:31.950 align:middle line:90%
People feel that way.

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:33.310 align:middle line:90%
They don't look at these things.

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yeah.

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to be able to
take that on and know where

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:middle line:90%
that fear just jumped up from.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:44.310 align:middle line:84%
You have to be able to
connect with the feeling

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:46.450 align:middle line:84%
of the heart of what really,
really matters to you.

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:47.910 align:middle line:90%
What does matter?

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And so once the need part
is adequately covered--

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:56.190 align:middle line:84%
because I bet you that almost
nobody watching this show has

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:58.530 align:middle line:90%
gone hungry in a long time--

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:03.900 align:middle line:84%
has even probably missed a
meal unless they're dieting.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And so what we think we need,
as you say-- is usually some--

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:12.410 align:middle line:84%
it's a generated fear that
oftentimes is generational.

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:14.870 align:middle line:84%
It's been passed on to
us on a lot of levels--

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:15.670 align:middle line:90%
I need this.

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:16.080 align:middle line:90%
I need this.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And the fear has been
passed on with it.

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:20.260 align:middle line:90%
So that requires some unwinding.

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It does.

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So meditation can help when
we recognize that we're

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:27.985 align:middle line:90%
able to take that step back.

00:36:27.985 --> 00:36:30.360 align:middle line:84%
Even if we don't know what's
going on, we just feel like,

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.340 align:middle line:90%
whoa, my heart's racing.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:34.060 align:middle line:90%
Something's going on here.

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Something's coming up--
asking how good can it get,

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:37.560 align:middle line:90%
and then feeling fear.

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.740 align:middle line:84%
What's that about--
or just feeling

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:44.550 align:middle line:84%
like I'm facing a situation
and thinking in terms of lack.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:45.649 align:middle line:90%
Why am I thinking that?

00:36:45.649 --> 00:36:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And you don't need to
know all the answers.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.540 align:middle line:84%
But just the process of
stepping back and asking,

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.270 align:middle line:90%
OK, how good can it get?

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:55.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that is.

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:56.430 align:middle line:90%
Let's find out.

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Because, like you said,
I haven't been starving.

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, the viewers have not
been in that position recently.

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And so if you've
got your health,

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:06.879 align:middle line:90%
then that's quite a bit.

00:37:06.879 --> 00:37:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're not
fully healthy but you've

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:10.530 align:middle line:84%
got most of your health,
that's really good.

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's really good.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: So it's about starting
from that place of gratitude.

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.910 align:middle line:90%
And then as far as the rest--

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:19.590 align:middle line:90%
again, maybe that is a--

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:22.320 align:middle line:84%
maybe this one little
subject, how good can it get,

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.750 align:middle line:84%
is the key question
in life, where

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:27.000 align:middle line:84%
we do start the process
of unraveling the rest

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.420 align:middle line:84%
and saying, wow, I can't believe
that I'm getting this feeling

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.220 align:middle line:90%
about this and this neediness.

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.504 align:middle line:90%
And where is that coming from?

00:37:33.504 --> 00:37:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're going
to get a flash.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I remember when my mom
always used to say this,

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:38.160 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.520 align:middle line:90%
Money doesn't grow on trees.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.603 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have enough
for the end of the month.

00:37:41.603 --> 00:37:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And you start getting maybe
some impressions from the past

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.520 align:middle line:90%
as to what's driven this.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And then, you can
start consciously

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:50.670 align:middle line:90%
untangling yourself.

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:52.050 align:middle line:90%
Is that my story?

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:54.180 align:middle line:84%
Do I need to
continue living that?

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And so then you're
ready to start going

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.510 align:middle line:90%
into the happy part of it.

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:59.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, what does my heart want?

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.090 align:middle line:84%
But it almost is like there's
a little subconscious cleaning

00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:02.430 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:02.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: There's a process.

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:03.030 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:05.595 align:middle line:84%
And I do get into that in the
book, "High Energy Money."

00:38:05.595 --> 00:38:10.170 align:middle line:84%
So it starts to identify where
those little beliefs are,

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:13.020 align:middle line:84%
and then you can create
your own fixes for them,

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:15.880 align:middle line:84%
affirmations that work for you,
and just flip things around.

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:16.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: It does help to
take a close look at that

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.650 align:middle line:84%
but then not dwell on it
once you've looked at it.

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, just to praise
it and start untangling it.

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things you
also share in the book

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:30.120 align:middle line:84%
is that when people
manifest and are

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:33.420 align:middle line:84%
able to share that on some
level, as a gift to someone

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:34.770 align:middle line:90%
or share in a larger--

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:37.170 align:middle line:84%
a societal way even
with other people,

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:41.130 align:middle line:84%
that their level of life
satisfaction and happiness

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:43.030 align:middle line:84%
almost inevitably
seems to go up.

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It does.

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that part of
this has to do with gratitude.

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:48.680 align:middle line:90%
Because then, you can feet--

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.220 align:middle line:90%
it's like a mirror-neuron thing.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.160 align:middle line:84%
You can feel their gratitude
so then you're grateful,

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and you get a big boost of
that wonderful gratitude.

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now this is just a
quirky little part of the book.

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a part of the
flow of the story.

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:05.010 align:middle line:84%
But I thought it was interesting
because it is so quirky--

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:08.230 align:middle line:84%
about what our idea
of money and value is.

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with the Yap
islanders, and their version

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:17.100 align:middle line:84%
of money, and how
they were motivated

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.450 align:middle line:84%
to work together on this
particular project and all

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:20.250 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:22.650 align:middle line:10%
But let's talk about
what money looks

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:24.026 align:middle line:10%
like among the Yap islanders.

00:39:24.026 --> 00:39:25.275 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Oh, this is amazing.

00:39:25.275 --> 00:39:26.483 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And where are they?

00:39:26.483 --> 00:39:28.740 align:middle line:84%
Where are the Yap
islanders to begin with?

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well they're up on
an island in the Pacific Ocean.

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's a pretty
remote location.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a little
series of islands out there.

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:38.870 align:middle line:10%
And the islanders
came up with the idea

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:42.750 align:middle line:10%
to show their wealth and
their riches in the form,

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:45.840 align:middle line:10%
not of coins like we know it
or anything small or shells

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.180 align:middle line:10%
like you might
expect, but instead,

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:52.710 align:middle line:10%
of these gigantic, large round--

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:54.400 align:middle line:10%
I think they're volcanic stones.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.200 align:middle line:10%
They're huge.

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.380 align:middle line:10%
They're bigger than a person.

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:57.546 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is it like a disk?

00:39:57.546 --> 00:39:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yes, it's
a huge standing disk.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:00.960 align:middle line:90%
It's too big to move.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:04.110 align:middle line:84%
So you can't just put it
in your wallet or purse.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Once you've got it,
it's sitting there.

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And then people
consider it's theirs.

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:10.600 align:middle line:84%
So one of them rolled
into the ocean,

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:12.260 align:middle line:84%
but they always--
they know it's there.

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:13.987 align:middle line:90%
And that belongs to so and so.

00:40:13.987 --> 00:40:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So and so.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:17.259 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who
creates their disk?

00:40:17.259 --> 00:40:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I don't think
they're still doing this.

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When they did this,
who would create the disk?

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I think
it was a person who

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:25.765 align:middle line:90%
had that job, a stone carver.

00:40:25.765 --> 00:40:27.815 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
I mean, but then,

00:40:27.815 --> 00:40:29.940 align:middle line:84%
how did they acquire them,
do you know what I mean?

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: How did
the whole process go?

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: I saw them.

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:34.450 align:middle line:84%
I actually visited Yap
when I was a young girl.

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And these stones were
towering over me.

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:38.280 align:middle line:90%
Like, wow, this is big.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're that big?

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Huge, yes.

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: So it's not
currently in use at this time.

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:48.550 align:middle line:84%
But there was a period of time
when even portions of the coins

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:51.790 align:middle line:84%
would be known to be, well,
I've got this little imaginary--

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like a
mark on the coin?

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:57.170 align:middle line:84%
Like, this part of it's
mine and my family's.

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:58.814 align:middle line:84%
And so it would stay
with the family.

00:40:58.814 --> 00:41:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Could you use
it for barter, though?

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: You could
use it for barter.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this-- you'd make a
notation or a mark on the stone

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.160 align:middle line:84%
that this is someone
else's part of my stone?

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.170 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I didn't see
any marks on the stones,

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:11.534 align:middle line:84%
but you can mark the stone, and
I think that would be helpful.

00:41:11.534 --> 00:41:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And then also, just
agree, like, we all know--

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Otherwise, it's just--

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.910 align:middle line:90%
the bookkeeping's in your head.

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: A lot of it
would be common agreement,

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:20.617 align:middle line:84%
and there wouldn't
be too many of these.

00:41:20.617 --> 00:41:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I mean, I just--

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:22.615 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:22.615 --> 00:41:23.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It was funny.

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:25.451 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We do it a
lot of different ways.

00:41:25.451 --> 00:41:26.860 align:middle line:90%
OK, so here's another area.

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And that is, you do
this little meditation.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.780 align:middle line:90%
It's about having a windfall.

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:35.020 align:middle line:84%
What happens if you
were to have a windfall?

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And I bring it up
because lottery winners--

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:42.550 align:middle line:84%
you know, that's often
a windfall for people.

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes they'll be
broke within a few years.

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:49.570 align:middle line:90%
This is the most common--

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:51.760 align:middle line:84%
would you say the stats
are like 2/3 of the people

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.850 align:middle line:84%
will be broke again, even
having to declare bankruptcy,

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:56.950 align:middle line:84%
worse off than they
were initially,

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:57.994 align:middle line:90%
within five years' time?

00:41:57.994 --> 00:41:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: So they
probably weren't

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:00.618 align:middle line:90%
doing, "How good can it get?"

00:42:00.618 --> 00:42:02.860 align:middle line:84%
If you use that
optimizing focus,

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:06.790 align:middle line:84%
then you'll be guided
toward continued prosperity.

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:08.710 align:middle line:84%
But it's easy, I
think, for people

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:12.910 align:middle line:84%
when they get that windfall
to not factor in what's

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:16.180 align:middle line:84%
going to happen with taxes,
and everybody flocking to them,

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:17.890 align:middle line:90%
and everybody now is--

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:19.070 align:middle line:90%
you're their best friend.

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:20.278 align:middle line:90%
And can you please help them?

00:42:20.278 --> 00:42:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The psychological
version of that--

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yeah, it's huge.

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:24.194 align:middle line:84%
I think part of it
is just getting back

00:42:24.194 --> 00:42:25.390 align:middle line:90%
to what they feel is normal.

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:26.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:28.420 align:middle line:84%
So now you're going
to do it and model it

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:29.820 align:middle line:90%
for us in a different way.

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And you have a meditation
in the book that

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:33.010 align:middle line:90%
is the windfall meditation.

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:36.754 align:middle line:84%
What happens if you receive
an unexpected windfall?

00:42:36.754 --> 00:42:37.670 align:middle line:90%
So tell us about this.

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:38.930 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: OK, well, I
can't quote the book.

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:39.460 align:middle line:90%
I didn't bring--

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:41.168 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, you
don't have to quote it.

00:42:41.168 --> 00:42:43.390 align:middle line:84%
But just the general feeling
of what happens then.

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well,
personally, what I

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:47.080 align:middle line:84%
would do right now is just start
with feeling of gratitude--

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.970 align:middle line:84%
just feel really
blessed about that

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and recognize that this is an
invitation to changing my life.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And based on the size of the
windfall, this can be a shock.

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So if it's a huge
windfall, then I

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:02.380 align:middle line:84%
know I need to just take
some step back, observe

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:05.560 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing, and just
be in the presence of it.

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:06.910 align:middle line:90%
This is really good advice.

00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Any time something big changes,
give yourself some time

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:13.457 align:middle line:84%
and allow yourself to feel
what you really feel about it.

00:43:13.457 --> 00:43:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So you may have
thought you wanted it,

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:18.130 align:middle line:84%
you may have thought you needed
it, that's your thinking.

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:19.509 align:middle line:90%
How do you really feel about it?

00:43:19.509 --> 00:43:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And for that, you might
need a little bit of time

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:23.570 align:middle line:90%
for it to sink in.

00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:24.890 align:middle line:90%
And then, do you really need?

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:26.350 align:middle line:90%
And this gets really deep.

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So giving yourself some time and
some permission to recognize,

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.800 align:middle line:90%
OK, now I've got this windfall.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.940 align:middle line:90%
And maybe it is huge.

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:36.460 align:middle line:90%
That's a shock to the system.

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:36.640 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
it brings a whole--

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.360 align:middle line:84%
it brings some
potential joys and also

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:42.130 align:middle line:84%
a lot of responsibilities
that one's never

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:43.240 align:middle line:90%
been faced with before.

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.060 align:middle line:90%
And so then it's good when you--

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:48.440 align:middle line:84%
I just apply, "How good
can it get?" to everything.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Because part of how good can it
get when I get a huge windfall,

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.794 align:middle line:84%
then I recognize,
I'll need a team,

00:43:53.794 --> 00:43:55.210 align:middle line:84%
because I can't
do this all alone.

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:56.710 align:middle line:90%
There is responsibility.

00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And previously, I might
have been doing everything

00:43:58.810 --> 00:43:59.610 align:middle line:90%
on my own.

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:01.780 align:middle line:84%
But now, what's it
going to look like now?

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.930 align:middle line:84%
How do I manage
this going forward?

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:05.110 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:05.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:07.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm not assuming that
I know the answers.

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, but we
have to start, just, looking

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:11.800 align:middle line:90%
at what that feels like.

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And now this happens
in a more common way

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:17.680 align:middle line:84%
all the time, every day,
where people inherit money

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:21.370 align:middle line:84%
from the previous generation who
maybe was good at manifesting

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:23.890 align:middle line:84%
or worked hard or whatever
and created something

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:25.120 align:middle line:90%
that could be passed on.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.910 align:middle line:84%
That's not happening
so much anymore.

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's going away.

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:30.730 align:middle line:84%
It has gone away
to a large extent.

00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:33.960 align:middle line:84%
But it's still occurring
where someone inherits,

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.460 align:middle line:84%
but they're inheriting
from a person that

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:38.990 align:middle line:84%
may have had a completely
different relationship

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.790 align:middle line:90%
to money.

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Exactly.

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:42.868 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You may be broke
and you suddenly inherit--

00:44:42.868 --> 00:44:45.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, maybe $500,000
or $600,000, you know?

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:47.220 align:middle line:90%
It can be sizable.

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, sizable.

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:49.690 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:51.564 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And you may
not have the experience

00:44:51.564 --> 00:44:55.750 align:middle line:84%
to deal with that because there
are implications for taxes

00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:56.630 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And so it's important to
get a team, definitely,

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:00.820 align:middle line:90%
at that point--

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:01.720 align:middle line:90%
get some good advice.

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard people
talk about this--

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:07.720 align:middle line:84%
that they say as much as
we like to demonize people

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:11.620 align:middle line:84%
at high levels of finance,
people who've manifested

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:14.260 align:middle line:84%
on large levels, for example--
because not all of them

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:15.960 align:middle line:90%
were like J Paul Getty.

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.440 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them have a lot
of joy in the acquisition.

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:18.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a game.

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:19.870 align:middle line:90%
They just like the game.

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:20.365 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Exactly.

00:45:20.365 --> 00:45:21.165 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:45:21.165 --> 00:45:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we look at
that as well, how greedy.

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:27.610 align:middle line:84%
More than anybody could
use for seven generations

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:29.380 align:middle line:90%
type of thing, right?

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:31.090 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, I think it's

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:33.250 align:middle line:84%
important around the
subject to acknowledge

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:35.200 align:middle line:90%
that it's a skill set.

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:39.580 align:middle line:84%
That person has
developed that skill set.

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Other people develop
other skill sets

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:44.050 align:middle line:84%
that are absolutely beautiful
and needed in the world.

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:47.650 align:middle line:84%
But we put so much prominence
around the acquisition

00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:48.970 align:middle line:90%
of physical wealth.

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: There's a lot
of emotional baggage

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:52.100 align:middle line:90%
that goes with it.

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because there's have,
have not, more, less, good,

00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:59.950 align:middle line:84%
not good enough, and that
kind of thing back and forth

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:00.950 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:05.200 align:middle line:84%
So I think that to stop kind
of judging and demonizing

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:08.530 align:middle line:84%
those who do have extreme wealth
just because they have it,

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:11.530 align:middle line:84%
and not guess at how
they got it or why,

00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:13.656 align:middle line:84%
and take yourself out of
that matrix of comparison,

00:46:13.656 --> 00:46:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I would think, would
be very important.

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: This is a big idea.

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's who are we?

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:19.280 align:middle line:90%
What's our identity?

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And it gets into us and
them and this entanglement,

00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:26.170 align:middle line:84%
again, of how do we
draw these boundaries?

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And how do we see ourselves
in relationship to others?

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, but
now, in here, too, we

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:33.650 align:middle line:84%
start getting back
to this timeline.

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:38.070 align:middle line:84%
You talk in the book
about remembering

00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:43.990 align:middle line:84%
a prosperous or happy event and
how this thing from the past

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:46.820 align:middle line:84%
comes through what we
perceive as the present

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:48.370 align:middle line:90%
and starts affecting the future.

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:50.170 align:middle line:84%
But the future may be
speaking to you, too.

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:52.390 align:middle line:90%
So talk about this.

00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:53.500 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Well--

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This
remembrance into--

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:57.984 align:middle line:84%
remembering your
prosperity, so to speak.

00:46:57.984 --> 00:46:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Remembering
your future.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Remembering
your future.

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: That is a
great thing to do.

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Because you can start feeling
grateful for your future,

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:07.330 align:middle line:90%
even if you haven't had it yet.

00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:09.460 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes that's
hard to do for people

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:11.970 align:middle line:84%
who don't feel like they
have much to be grateful for.

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:14.710 align:middle line:84%
So you can jump start it
by remembering something

00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:18.430 align:middle line:84%
that you're grateful for in
the past and then charge it up.

00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:19.360 align:middle line:90%
If you will.

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Because that gratitude
is high-octane stuff.

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:27.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like rocket fuel, and it
can really get you into places

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.660 align:middle line:90%
that you've never been.

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:30.400 align:middle line:84%
So when you
visualize your future

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.190 align:middle line:84%
and are grateful
for your future,

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:36.865 align:middle line:84%
it's a way of playing
with your meditations.

00:47:36.865 --> 00:47:39.694 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is
exemplified in another book

00:47:39.694 --> 00:47:41.860 align:middle line:84%
from an author-- a brand
new one called "The Miracle

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Club" by a man named Mitch
Horowitz, who I recently

00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:45.220 align:middle line:90%
interviewed.

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:48.050 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed him I
think three or four times.

00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And what he's
saying in there is,

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:52.990 align:middle line:84%
when you sit down to do
this kind of gratitude

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:56.537 align:middle line:84%
or this kind of meditation
into the future,

00:47:56.537 --> 00:47:58.870 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times you don't have
the proper attitude going.

00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:00.370 align:middle line:84%
You don't have the
right juju going.

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:01.169 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:48:01.169 --> 00:48:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he's saying
the exact same thing.

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Go to the past and
remember something joyful,

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:10.450 align:middle line:84%
something exquisite,
even just something fun--

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:14.110 align:middle line:84%
bring that energy up so it's
running up through your being,

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:15.270 align:middle line:90%
then start your meditation.

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Exactly.

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:18.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can't do it
from a depressed place.

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:19.349 align:middle line:90%
It simply isn't going to work.

00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's right.

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, it will bring
negative results.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you
have any examples

00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:26.170 align:middle line:84%
of that-- of people
or situations

00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:28.210 align:middle line:84%
you know of where they
just pray, and then do

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:30.880 align:middle line:84%
the rituals everyday, and
things don't manifest,

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.657 align:middle line:84%
and they actually
talk to you about it?

00:48:32.657 --> 00:48:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I work
with lots of clients.

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.514 align:middle line:84%
And that's often a
common situation,

00:48:36.514 --> 00:48:38.680 align:middle line:84%
where they're feeling like
things are just not good.

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:40.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not just money, either.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:42.340 align:middle line:90%
It affects everything.

00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I mean,
they're working their tail off.

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:47.660 align:middle line:84%
They're doing their
meditations on a daily basis.

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they, say how come
this whole thing doesn't work?

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:52.900 align:middle line:90%
I've done my collage.

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.260 align:middle line:90%
I look at it every day.

00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So again, to me, it's
identity, and it's observation,

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:02.050 align:middle line:84%
and it's the influence
that we have as observers.

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:05.320 align:middle line:84%
But if you're entangled with
this sadness and this feeling

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:08.650 align:middle line:90%
of grief, loss, hardship--

00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:11.950 align:middle line:84%
just being left out, this
whole concept of us and them,

00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:14.050 align:middle line:84%
and nowadays there's
so much of that--

00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:17.020 align:middle line:84%
the whole us-them thing
going on-- that people feel

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:18.200 align:middle line:90%
threatened.

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot of
hardship going on right now.

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:22.832 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:49:22.832 --> 00:49:24.290 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
I did for years--

00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:26.414 align:middle line:84%
and I've said this in
another show or two probably,

00:49:26.414 --> 00:49:28.870 align:middle line:84%
but I'll just bring it up
again if someone didn't see it.

00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:30.430 align:middle line:90%
Because I think it does matter.

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:35.320 align:middle line:84%
It's this whole notion of
making your collage, your vision

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.970 align:middle line:90%
board of what you want.

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And I used to do
this all the time.

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:40.870 align:middle line:90%
25 years ago, I was doing that.

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'd have friends over, and
we'd do it on New Year's Eve.

00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And the point was,
I give everyone

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:48.110 align:middle line:84%
who wanted it a
glass of champagne,

00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:50.110 align:middle line:84%
told them bring their
glue sticks, and scissors,

00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:51.850 align:middle line:90%
and their piles of magazines.

00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And when we sat down, I said,
you know, I can tell you how--

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:59.950 align:middle line:84%
one way I find that's effective
to do this thing, which

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:02.590 align:middle line:84%
almost no one heard, but I'd
say it every year the same.

00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And that is, when you're
going through your images,

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.710 align:middle line:84%
don't stop and analyze them with
the left side of your brain.

00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Do not analyze that picture
or why you're drawn to it.

00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:14.070 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that.

00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:17.495 align:middle line:84%
Or, oh, yes, I generally
like things that are yellow.

00:50:17.495 --> 00:50:18.630 align:middle line:90%
No, don't do that.

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:19.830 align:middle line:90%
Go through very quickly--

00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:20.630 align:middle line:90%
go through.

00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:22.464 align:middle line:84%
And it's like,
[GASP],, tear it out.

00:50:22.464 --> 00:50:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And you know, just
anything that's

00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:26.837 align:middle line:84%
like, ugh, yes, that
excites you, tear it out.

00:50:26.837 --> 00:50:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Because then,
it's not just you're head.

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:29.640 align:middle line:90%
You're getting your heart.

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:30.330 align:middle line:90%
You're getting your gut.

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:31.245 align:middle line:90%
You're getting the full body.

00:50:31.245 --> 00:50:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
getting the full thing.

00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:34.073 align:middle line:84%
You're even getting
little whisperings

00:50:34.073 --> 00:50:34.960 align:middle line:90%
from the higher mind.

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Exactly.

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.551 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so all
this is coming through

00:50:37.551 --> 00:50:38.865 align:middle line:90%
if it's spontaneous.

00:50:38.865 --> 00:50:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I said, little,
champagne, it's like, ooh!

00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:42.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes, yes, yes.

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what would
happen is, each year, it

00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:46.817 align:middle line:90%
was kind of a similar thing.

00:50:46.817 --> 00:50:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Most of the things on my
board would come to pass.

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:50.441 align:middle line:84%
It didn't matter
how kooky they were.

00:50:50.441 --> 00:50:51.840 align:middle line:90%
They'd just come to pass.

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Because they were just done
in that spirit of fun--

00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:57.884 align:middle line:84%
and just kind of a quick desire,
and I loved it, and weird--

00:50:57.884 --> 00:50:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Playfulness.

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Every kind
of gift would come.

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it didn't
matter if I put--

00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:05.920 align:middle line:84%
a woman riding a horse, someone
under the water, a piano--

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.280 align:middle line:84%
it would all come in gifts
from different people

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.067 align:middle line:90%
in the weirdest situations.

00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:12.150 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just validating,
like, you're pulling money

00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:13.920 align:middle line:90%
out of your wallet and such.

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:16.680 align:middle line:84%
I've experienced
this many, many times

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:20.160 align:middle line:84%
as a result of that
simple, joyful desire.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And people really squash
the notion of desire, right?

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:24.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:26.730 align:middle line:84%
But I think people
are waking up to it.

00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:29.100 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason I'm talking
about the Mandela effect

00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:31.980 align:middle line:84%
so much, because people
are noticing globally

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:33.210 align:middle line:90%
that things are changing.

00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
nature works that way--

00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:39.240 align:middle line:84%
that we live in this
highly improbable reality

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:42.150 align:middle line:84%
because these shifts
are happening.

00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And we are, actually,
in alignment with them.

00:51:44.850 --> 00:51:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're creating
alternate realities for ourself

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:48.840 align:middle line:90%
all the time--

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes, all the time.

00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --in that
super position.

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: It's not
just two timelines.

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:54.018 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes
people feel like,

00:51:54.018 --> 00:51:56.670 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm in a timeline
with this or that.

00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:58.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You brought
a little prop with you.

00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: I did.

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They only have like,
oh, I don't five or seven

00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:02.313 align:middle line:90%
minutes left or something.

00:52:02.313 --> 00:52:04.671 align:middle line:84%
Let's play with
this just so we can

00:52:04.671 --> 00:52:05.920 align:middle line:90%
see what you're talking about.

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:07.753 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: So this is
what I'm talking about.

00:52:07.753 --> 00:52:09.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm covering over the name.

00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:11.520 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: We all know
these guys, right?

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yes, we
know these guys.

00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We know this family.

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:13.780 align:middle line:90%
It's the Berenstein.

00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:14.580 align:middle line:90%
Family, right?

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:16.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Right, that's
how I pronounce it.

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.320 align:middle line:10%
But then if I take my fingers
away, we see the reveal--

00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:21.060 align:middle line:10%
it's the Berenstein.

00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:22.050 align:middle line:90%
Bears.

00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:22.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:22.850 --> 00:52:26.444 align:middle line:84%
Not one person would
ever say anything other

00:52:26.444 --> 00:52:27.360 align:middle line:90%
than what I just said.

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Berenstein.

00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's the
Berenstain family.

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Which makes no
sense when there's an A-I-N.

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:32.902 align:middle line:90%
You don't say Bear-en-steen.

00:52:32.902 --> 00:52:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You would say
"Bear-en-stain" family.

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:35.115 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Bear-en-stain.

00:52:35.115 --> 00:52:37.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But it never has been.

00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:39.540 align:middle line:90%
What happened there?

00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:41.340 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: This is what
I'm talking about.

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: First of all, you
can tell people very briefly--

00:52:43.170 --> 00:52:44.378 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to have time.

00:52:44.378 --> 00:52:47.070 align:middle line:90%
We did this in our last show.

00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:48.310 align:middle line:90%
The Mandela effect.

00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:51.068 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What started
it, why it has its name,

00:52:51.068 --> 00:52:53.080 align:middle line:84%
and what just happened
with the Berenstain.

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:53.880 align:middle line:90%
Family there?

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:55.796 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well this
actually is the same thing

00:52:55.796 --> 00:52:58.560 align:middle line:84%
that I've been studying with
reality shifts for 20 years.

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:02.190 align:middle line:84%
But I did not have the ability
when I started in the 1990s

00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:04.890 align:middle line:84%
to be tracking globally
with thousands of people

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:07.120 align:middle line:84%
that all remember
the same thing.

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:09.510 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting larger and
larger numbers of people

00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:13.050 align:middle line:84%
through the internet capable
of trading experiences

00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:15.420 align:middle line:84%
and finding out that
something's changed.

00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:17.940 align:middle line:84%
So there's an alternate
history other than what

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:19.860 align:middle line:84%
we remember that
now has affected

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:22.770 align:middle line:84%
every single book, every
single movie, every item--

00:53:22.770 --> 00:53:24.100 align:middle line:90%


00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:25.570 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:53:25.570 --> 00:53:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Why is it called
the Mandela effect?

00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: OK, this was a
term coined by Fiona Broome,

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:34.740 align:middle line:84%
and she had gone to a
conference and found out

00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:37.350 align:middle line:84%
that many people who
attended all remembered

00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:41.040 align:middle line:84%
that Nelson Mandela had died in
prison when he was incarcerated

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.680 align:middle line:84%
in South Africa, which
is something I've written

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:48.450 align:middle line:84%
about many years earlier back
in the 1990s about Larry Hagman

00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:49.710 align:middle line:90%
in my book "Reality Shifts."

00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:53.400 align:middle line:84%
I cover that-- that he was
alive again after having died.

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:57.240 align:middle line:90%
But now, we've got blogs.

00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:00.504 align:middle line:84%
That did not exist in the 1990s
when I started tracking this.

00:54:00.504 --> 00:54:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And so, now, we've
got the ability

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:06.030 align:middle line:84%
through sites like Reddit to
start noticing lots of people

00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:07.330 align:middle line:90%
also remember this.

00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
Nelson Mandela,

00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:11.310 align:middle line:90%
but he was one of the first.

00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's called "Mandela
effect," meaning--

00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:16.590 align:middle line:84%
it's a global kind
of a reality shift

00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:18.190 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't affect everyone.

00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And technically, it's
called "misremembering."

00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:23.730 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is
that it's explained

00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:25.650 align:middle line:84%
by all of the things
we've been talking

00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:29.560 align:middle line:84%
about-- by quantum effects
that are happening everywhere.

00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:31.590 align:middle line:90%
There is no quantum realm.

00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:34.290 align:middle line:84%
We can literally see
history change, and we do.

00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:35.720 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I write about.

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so in some
timeline, he was dead.

00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:39.505 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:54:39.505 --> 00:54:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
what they talked about.

00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:42.440 align:middle line:84%
That's what was
in the newspapers.

00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:43.140 align:middle line:90%
That's what everyone remembers.

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It was on TV.

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.040 align:middle line:90%
And there was--

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But then
he was not dead.

00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:50.520 align:middle line:84%
In this reality that's
currently the official history,

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:51.750 align:middle line:90%
as far as I know--

00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:53.130 align:middle line:90%
these things do change--

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:55.980 align:middle line:90%
but right now, he was released.

00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:59.400 align:middle line:84%
He had a huge epiphany
when he was incarcerated.

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:02.580 align:middle line:84%
He came out a changed
man, became as a leader,

00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:04.760 align:middle line:90%
he was president, all of that.

00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's talk
about the Berenstains.

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:11.330 align:middle line:84%
The writers, the authors
the creators, were who?

00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Now-- well, I
remember they were "Berenstein."

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I remember.

00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:16.515 align:middle line:90%
And now, it's "Berenstain."

00:55:16.515 --> 00:55:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they say that's
always been their name?

00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: They say it's
always been "the Berenstain."

00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:23.680 align:middle line:84%
They're feeling there's so much
fuss about this Mandela thing.

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And as far as they know, it's
always been "Berenstain."

00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:28.410 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I mean.

00:55:28.410 --> 00:55:30.710 align:middle line:84%
You'll encounter
people who remember--

00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:32.946 align:middle line:84%
you'll remember your
childhood very clearly,

00:55:32.946 --> 00:55:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and they were
there, too, but you

00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:35.652 align:middle line:90%
remember two different things.

00:55:35.652 --> 00:55:37.860 align:middle line:84%
This is what I've been
studying with "Reality Shift,"

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:40.020 align:middle line:84%
so now, we're experiencing
it on a global scale.

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:41.067 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:55:41.067 --> 00:55:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was in our
previous conversation,

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:43.983 align:middle line:90%
so people can look for it.

00:55:43.983 --> 00:55:45.750 align:middle line:84%
We only have a couple
of minutes left.

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:48.166 align:middle line:84%
And there was another little
example in your book I loved.

00:55:48.166 --> 00:55:49.350 align:middle line:90%
It's on gambling.

00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:52.162 align:middle line:84%
That's not normally good
financial planning, right?

00:55:52.162 --> 00:55:55.470 align:middle line:84%
However, this one gambler
that you either know

00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:58.260 align:middle line:84%
or encountered who's
a successful gambler

00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.330 align:middle line:90%
has this one practice.

00:56:00.330 --> 00:56:02.490 align:middle line:84%
He only goes to
high-energy tables.

00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Talk about what that means
compared to the other tables.

00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:06.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Oh, this is huge.

00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And I've used this when
I was on a cruise ship

00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:09.510 align:middle line:84%
and didn't bring--
and again, forgot

00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:11.850 align:middle line:84%
to bring enough money
for tipping the staff.

00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:13.040 align:middle line:90%
What is this with me?

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:13.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:14.770 align:middle line:90%
It's a thing.

00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:16.080 align:middle line:90%
But he's right.

00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:18.682 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know this gambler,
but he would look just

00:56:18.682 --> 00:56:20.640 align:middle line:84%
for the high-energy tables
because that's where

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:21.764 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be winning.

00:56:21.764 --> 00:56:23.550 align:middle line:84%
If you can sense
energy, some people

00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:26.790 align:middle line:84%
use dowsing tools to find it,
so you can learn to dowse.

00:56:26.790 --> 00:56:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can learn to do that.

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:30.840 align:middle line:84%
I can dowse with my
hands and with my energy

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:32.160 align:middle line:90%
field, no problem.

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:34.450 align:middle line:84%
So when I was on the
cruise ship myself,

00:56:34.450 --> 00:56:37.500 align:middle line:84%
I just went around and found
the high-energy slot machines

00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:38.817 align:middle line:90%
so that we were able to--

00:56:38.817 --> 00:56:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I was with a roommate,
and we filled our cup

00:56:40.650 --> 00:56:44.130 align:middle line:84%
to the exact right amount
for the tipping again--

00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:45.140 align:middle line:90%
this time with gambling.

00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:45.390 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It totally works.

00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And so the point
is, he would notice

00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:51.310 align:middle line:84%
where there were people who
were desperate at a table.

00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who were
sitting there like this,

00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:55.440 align:middle line:90%
like gotta win this hand.

00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's another guy--

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gotta win this hand.

00:56:56.730 --> 00:56:56.985 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:56:56.985 --> 00:56:57.365 align:middle line:90%


00:56:57.365 --> 00:56:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when
he saw those tables,

00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:01.470 align:middle line:84%
he walked away from those
because it says, saturated

00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:02.910 align:middle line:90%
in desperation and fear.

00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:05.860 align:middle line:84%
If someone was rolling the dice,
having a good time, it's like,

00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:06.660 align:middle line:90%
that's--

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: That's'
where you want to be.

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's where you
want to be because that's

00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:10.050 align:middle line:90%
where the energy comes in.

00:57:10.050 --> 00:57:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
prosperity comes through.

00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Exactly.

00:57:12.810 --> 00:57:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yeah.

00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The window
it comes through.

00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: You can feel it.

00:57:14.730 --> 00:57:15.590 align:middle line:90%
You can really feel it.

00:57:15.590 --> 00:57:16.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:18.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we only
have like a minute left.

00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And gratitude, as
you say, is huge.

00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It is.

00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:22.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To say thank
you for what I do have,

00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:24.505 align:middle line:84%
thank you, thank
you, I know I'm OK.

00:57:24.505 --> 00:57:24.800 align:middle line:90%


00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And taking
a little step back,

00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:27.940 align:middle line:84%
just observing that
you're not your thoughts.

00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:28.981 align:middle line:90%
You're not your feelings.

00:57:28.981 --> 00:57:30.240 align:middle line:90%
You can observe all of that.

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: This is the key to
consciousness itself to just be

00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:35.832 align:middle line:84%
aware that you're
able to observe--

00:57:35.832 --> 00:57:38.040 align:middle line:84%
have a perception of something
and have the awareness

00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:39.390 align:middle line:90%
of the perception.

00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:41.460 align:middle line:84%
This is what life
needs originally

00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:44.020 align:middle line:84%
postulated as to the
definition of consciousness.

00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So don't become
entangled in your own story.

00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's right.

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's just a story.

00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It's a story.

00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:50.550 align:middle line:90%
And that level of--

00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Everything can change
in a second for the better.

00:57:54.030 --> 00:57:54.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It can.

00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And on that note, I think
that's the perfect finish.

00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:58.500 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:57:58.500 --> 00:57:59.880 align:middle line:90%
I love that you wrote--

00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:00.780 align:middle line:90%
it's a little book.

00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:02.820 align:middle line:84%
You wrote it quite
a while back, but I

00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:04.890 align:middle line:84%
was digging through all
your books and thought,

00:58:04.890 --> 00:58:05.760 align:middle line:90%
I want to do that.

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Because we need to
really shift on this one

00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:11.970 align:middle line:84%
big time, as individuals
and collectively.

00:58:11.970 --> 00:58:13.170 align:middle line:90%
And I love what you did.

00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:14.170 align:middle line:90%
It's accessible.

00:58:14.170 --> 00:58:15.805 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
conversation took us

00:58:15.805 --> 00:58:17.380 align:middle line:90%
to some really good places.

00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:18.000 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Thank you so much.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:21.330 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Cynthia.

00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:24.180 align:middle line:84%
Again, the name of Cynthia's
book is "High Energy Money."

00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:25.071 align:middle line:90%
It's a fun read it.

00:58:25.071 --> 00:58:26.570 align:middle line:84%
It gives some very
useful exercises.

00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:28.528 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be willing
to put a little time

00:58:28.528 --> 00:58:31.050 align:middle line:84%
and passion into the process
like we just talked about.

00:58:31.050 --> 00:58:32.850 align:middle line:90%
It requires a little unearthing.

00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.480 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."
