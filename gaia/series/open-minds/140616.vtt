00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.162 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.162 --> 00:00:28.620 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Perhaps the most

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.409 align:middle line:10%
speculated about aspect of
life is our own birth, death,

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:33.450 align:middle line:10%
and rebirth.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.890 align:middle line:84%
In this sense,
life is a mystery.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Each culture and religion
has its own ideas

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.420 align:middle line:84%
about what happens
between lives,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.940 align:middle line:84%
so I thought I would ask
Lee Harrison and his Zs

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.790 align:middle line:84%
to join us today to talk
about the entire process

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.570 align:middle line:84%
of incarnation from
death to review,

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.980 align:middle line:84%
to reincarnating as a
forgetful baby once again.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.440 align:middle line:84%
It's so good to
have you here, Lee.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.231 align:middle line:84%
We haven't seen each
other in about a year,

00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:57.020 align:middle line:84%
and you and the Zs just fill
the space up with lovely energy.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>>LEE HARRIS: Thank you.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.930 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be back.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's interesting,
because the Zs are already

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.606 align:middle line:84%
aware of what we're going
to be talking about,

00:01:02.606 --> 00:01:04.860 align:middle line:84%
and I find it's interesting
each time we begin.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.720 align:middle line:84%
I sense them a
little differently.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.550 align:middle line:84%
The field is a little bit
different, and today it was--

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.670 align:middle line:84%
connecting with them is
a little more intense.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.679 align:middle line:90%
Did you feel that, too?

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:17.220 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, I've
noticed actually

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.120 align:middle line:10%
in the last kind
of 6 to 12 months

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.200 align:middle line:10%
there is a different energy.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.996 align:middle line:10%
It seems to me that,
as a channeler,

00:01:23.996 --> 00:01:26.370 align:middle line:10%
there is some kind of meeting
point between the frequency

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.900 align:middle line:10%
that you bring
through as a channel

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.990 align:middle line:10%
and what's going on in the
world or what's required,

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.450 align:middle line:10%
and I think for me personally
because the world has become

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.730 align:middle line:10%
more intense in
the last 12 months

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.049 align:middle line:10%
I've noticed they
have a bit more edge.

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to say it
feels like they're rolling up

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.370 align:middle line:90%
their sleeves.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.480 align:middle line:90%
You want to talk about this?

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, Let's get going.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Because in the past it's
been a little lighter,

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.270 align:middle line:84%
a little further away,
and so I mean this--

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.970 align:middle line:84%
as you just mentioned, you've
been working your little tail

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:90%
off.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.890 align:middle line:90%
You've been all over the world.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Every time I see you on
Facebook or elsewhere you're

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.310 align:middle line:84%
in some other country teaching
your energy mastery work

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.280 align:middle line:84%
and the Zs have been
bringing through information

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.030 align:middle line:84%
about these times in addition
to your normal range of work.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And maybe just before we
get into this larger subject

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.900 align:middle line:84%
give us an idea of some of
what they've had to say,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:84%
because so many
people are worried.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Many people are feeling
almost panicky, actually,

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.110 align:middle line:90%
about our future.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.615 align:middle line:90%
So what do they say about this?

00:02:23.615 --> 00:02:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: A couple
of things that

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.590 align:middle line:84%
came up which struck me where
they talked about ancestral

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.980 align:middle line:90%
clearing at these times.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.875 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
some of the fears

00:02:32.875 --> 00:02:35.250 align:middle line:84%
that people are having about
what they're seeing going on

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.970 align:middle line:84%
in the world directly tap
into other times on the planet

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.960 align:middle line:84%
that this has happened, that
these kinds of, if you like,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.260 align:middle line:84%
control situations have
been rising to the surface

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.700 align:middle line:90%
or people--

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.140 align:middle line:84%
countries have gone through
real struggles, real conflict

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.950 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So they were talking
about the difference

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.630 align:middle line:84%
between what will happen and
what we perceive will happen,

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.350 align:middle line:84%
what we fear, and they talked
about the power of our fear

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.160 align:middle line:90%
to eliminate old, stuck energy.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.020 align:middle line:84%
So the idea being
that, if you're

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.610 align:middle line:84%
panicked that a
certain thing is going

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.401 align:middle line:84%
to happen in this
country, or that country,

00:03:10.401 --> 00:03:12.150 align:middle line:84%
or on the world stage,
it will directly

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.270 align:middle line:84%
tap into times that
you remember not just

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.975 align:middle line:84%
from your own other
lifetimes, but that

00:03:16.975 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:84%
are in the collective
energy memory field.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:84%
So that hit me because
when I understood

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.110 align:middle line:84%
that, I started to notice
many of my own fears,

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.080 align:middle line:84%
and track them that way, and
just really sit with what

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.440 align:middle line:84%
was going on inside my own
body, just breathe through it,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and to remember that
all of this is so much

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:84%
bigger than the now, which is
hard for us as human beings,

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.590 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.520 align:middle line:90%
We're in our identity.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.320 align:middle line:90%
We're in our life.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.653 align:middle line:90%
We're looking at the government.

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:41.970 align:middle line:90%
We're looking at our job.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.750 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at
our relationship.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And yet the truth is
whenever you reconnect

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.270 align:middle line:84%
to the wider source energy this
is but one tiny dot, and so

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:84%
the one thing that they
talked about in terms

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.840 align:middle line:90%
of this timeline--

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.100 align:middle line:84%
they said that it has been
destined for a very long time

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.500 align:middle line:84%
that-- and I mean that's no
news to those of us who've been

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.010 align:middle line:84%
tracking this kind
of information--

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.270 align:middle line:84%
and this period that
we're going through

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.660 align:middle line:84%
is going to be intense,
difficult period

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.790 align:middle line:84%
of dissolution, but
it is that rising

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:84%
to the surface of all of the
shadows that previously were

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:84%
hidden or that people
were more blind to,

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.980 align:middle line:84%
and it's a slow process
because if you look

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.050 align:middle line:84%
at the mass of
people on the planet,

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.420 align:middle line:84%
there might be a certain
percentage who are aware of all

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.940 align:middle line:84%
of this, another percentage
who are just catching up,

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.480 align:middle line:84%
and then another percentage who
it's more comfortable for them

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.060 align:middle line:90%
to believe this isn't happening.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.710 align:middle line:90%
This couldn't be true.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.320 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot
around shadows, lies,

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.470 align:middle line:84%
truth that is really
intense for people,

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.380 align:middle line:84%
and it causes very deep
emotional reactions.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's interesting
because about maybe nine months

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.010 align:middle line:84%
to a year ago when I would be
meditating I'd keep having this

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.430 align:middle line:90%
kind of side view of someone--

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.610 align:middle line:84%
us, me, whomever--
packing up their bags

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:84%
and standing on the platform
at the railway station

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.230 align:middle line:90%
ready to hop on the train.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.970 align:middle line:90%
And it was persistent.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.980 align:middle line:84%
It was like it's
time to move now.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.430 align:middle line:84%
It's time to move, and
not knowing actually

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.770 align:middle line:84%
what was going to be
bubbling up at that time

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.900 align:middle line:84%
and what has
transpired since then.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And now this feeling is
almost predominant in people--

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.300 align:middle line:90%
this edginess.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.100 align:middle line:90%
Do I stay?

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.900 align:middle line:90%
Do I go?

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.104 align:middle line:84%
Even to the point of in
this country people talking

00:05:22.104 --> 00:05:23.520 align:middle line:84%
about, do I leave
the country now?

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean, do we abandon ship?

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the
same time, if we're

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.630 align:middle line:84%
looking at this as
an incarnation story

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.060 align:middle line:84%
to begin with, every
one of us chose

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:90%
to be embodied for this show.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, that's the
thing they always reassure,

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and I'm always struck
when I do channel

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.980 align:middle line:84%
I can be going through my own
human experience or struggle,

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.676 align:middle line:84%
or kind, of whatever I'm
clearing in my human energy

00:05:45.676 --> 00:05:47.300 align:middle line:84%
field around it, and
then I'll channel.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And while they'll acknowledge
that stuff, and they'll say,

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.340 align:middle line:84%
yeah, this is going on,
and this isn't easy,

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.200 align:middle line:84%
they will also take
it bigger picture.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And they will always talk
about the bigger picture,

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.080 align:middle line:84%
and when you hear it, it
does help you reconnect to--

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.620 align:middle line:90%
well, I'll put it this way.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.660 align:middle line:84%
The one thing I always
try to remember if ever I

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.820 align:middle line:84%
get to zeroed in on
something that's going on

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.145 align:middle line:84%
for me is that the Zs are always
saying you can die at any time.

00:06:11.145 --> 00:06:13.100 align:middle line:84%
They say it's really
easy for you to die.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.130 align:middle line:84%
You all have what they call
death windows preprogrammed

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.260 align:middle line:84%
through your life, and
it's not just one, or two,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.850 align:middle line:90%
or three exit points.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.770 align:middle line:84%
They say for some people
it's tens and tens,

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.940 align:middle line:90%
and for some it's hundreds.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.630 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
constant renegotiation.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.088 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's interesting.

00:06:26.088 --> 00:06:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So I always remind
people who have that story of I

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:29.960 align:middle line:90%
don't want to be here of that.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well if you are
here, get curious about why.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Get curious about
why you're here

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.590 align:middle line:84%
and what you're here to learn to
do, to take that, if you like,

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.400 align:middle line:84%
higher frequency energy and
learn to find a way to bring it

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.920 align:middle line:84%
into this world that you
may have a rejection of

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.872 align:middle line:84%
or you may think, well, this
is all just low frequency.

00:06:48.872 --> 00:06:50.330 align:middle line:84%
That's not actually
the truth, so I

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.750 align:middle line:84%
think this time is really
about more higher frequencies,

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.410 align:middle line:84%
and that looks like
more compassion for one

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.870 align:middle line:84%
another, more
helping each other,

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.000 align:middle line:84%
less of the kind of
hierarchical structures

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.750 align:middle line:84%
that we've been in beginning to
permeate in society, but first,

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.880 align:middle line:84%
of course, as that
starts to permeate

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.650 align:middle line:84%
there is this almighty
rise of hierarchy again.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So there is a kind of war
of consciousness going on.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a confluence
of events-- no doubt about it.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And what about the notion that
there is no period of history

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.970 align:middle line:84%
that does not offer
a very direct mirror

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.610 align:middle line:90%
reflection for ourselves?

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, I like that.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.430 align:middle line:90%
I kind of go with that myself.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.850 align:middle line:84%
I also look at all of
the external events

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.930 align:middle line:84%
that we're in right now and
try and try that on for size.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.460 align:middle line:84%
I think, OK, if
this is what we've

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.709 align:middle line:84%
created, what is it that
we're going to learn from it?

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly,
what is it perhaps

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.580 align:middle line:90%
protecting the future from?

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I know everybody tends to
go along the line of, oh--

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --the
future is in trouble

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.760 align:middle line:84%
because of what's going on
now, and I'm like, well,

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.500 align:middle line:84%
if you think of events
in your own life

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.680 align:middle line:84%
where you go through a
period where you think,

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.390 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is the end of my
life or this is so difficult,

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and then you, a few
years later, look back,

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.557 align:middle line:84%
people will often say, oh,
well if that hadn't happened,

00:08:01.557 --> 00:08:03.140 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have moved
to this country.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.473 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't have met that person.

00:08:04.473 --> 00:08:06.190 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have
changed my career path.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.480 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very curious
about this time

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.470 align:middle line:84%
how we'll look at
it in 10, 20 years

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and what we will see
was, if you like,

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.320 align:middle line:84%
the benefit of what we're
struggling through right now.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I've been
saying this all along.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.101 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
huge benefit to it.

00:08:18.101 --> 00:08:19.280 align:middle line:90%
It's very uncomfortable.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.040 align:middle line:84%
It's very uncertain,
but the notion

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.605 align:middle line:84%
that the human being is
wishing to express change

00:08:26.605 --> 00:08:28.730 align:middle line:84%
on the planet-- we're going
through an opportunity,

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:33.020 align:middle line:84%
a wide expanse of time that
is really dedicated to change

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.799 align:middle line:84%
and upliftment
for those who can,

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.710 align:middle line:84%
and that's really the
key for those who can,

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.980 align:middle line:84%
and who are aware,
and who are capable.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.260 align:middle line:84%
What I find interesting
is what happens

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.740 align:middle line:84%
to those who have completely
fallen asleep even

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.880 align:middle line:84%
further under the spell of the
mass messaging and so forth.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.002 align:middle line:90%
Then what happens?

00:08:54.002 --> 00:08:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: How do
they deal with it?

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Because the discomfort
you talk about,

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.570 align:middle line:90%
I think that's the one thing--

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm hearing a lot of, for want
of a better term, lightworkers,

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.049 align:middle line:84%
conscious people,
awake people talking

00:09:05.049 --> 00:09:06.840 align:middle line:84%
about the discomfort
they're going through,

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.506 align:middle line:84%
or certain people are
saying, oh my god,

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:11.840 align:middle line:84%
I felt really good a few years
ago, and now I'm in my stuff,

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.670 align:middle line:90%
and it's really intense.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.830 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the way
that you experience it

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.600 align:middle line:84%
if you're working with
your consciousness

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.487 align:middle line:84%
and observing while
experiencing your life,

00:09:20.487 --> 00:09:22.070 align:middle line:84%
and then I think the
group that you're

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.444 align:middle line:84%
talking about--
they may be going

00:09:23.444 --> 00:09:25.820 align:middle line:84%
through very direct
externalized difficulties

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.740 align:middle line:90%
to get them into those emotions.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think so, and
looking at the large--

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.510 align:middle line:84%
backing up to the largest
picture, as you say,

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.810 align:middle line:84%
this is a blip on the
screen of human history--

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.210 align:middle line:90%
just another one of those blips.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And there is a type
of endless grace

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:44.210 align:middle line:84%
that exists where
there is no time.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.420 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing but
time to remember,

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.970 align:middle line:84%
to start waking back up
into your understanding

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.970 align:middle line:84%
of the true potential of life,
and your own true potential.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.224 align:middle line:84%
And so on one hand,
it's like, oh my god,

00:09:56.224 --> 00:09:57.890 align:middle line:84%
the train is pulling
out of the station.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.840 align:middle line:84%
We're becoming more
polarized than ever.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.100 align:middle line:90%
People are so fearful.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.410 align:middle line:84%
They're falling into a
deeper and deeper sleep,

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.770 align:middle line:84%
and then you have others that
are blissing out more and more.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And really it's quite
a show, but in the end,

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:15.530 align:middle line:84%
I do believe there's this
endless time to wake up,

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.830 align:middle line:84%
to figure it out, and to
choose where you are going

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.044 align:middle line:90%
to go from here as a being.

00:10:21.044 --> 00:10:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I always
think of people

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.835 align:middle line:84%
who are at the
end of their life,

00:10:23.835 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:84%
and they know
they're about to die.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.560 align:middle line:84%
They will completely change
their way of appreciating

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.622 align:middle line:90%
experience the world.

00:10:29.622 --> 00:10:31.830 align:middle line:84%
There might be an argument
going on in their hospital

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.022 align:middle line:84%
room between two family
members, and they're just

00:10:34.022 --> 00:10:35.730 align:middle line:84%
looking at the tree
out the window going,

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.080 align:middle line:84%
oh, there's a tree,
and I know I'm not

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.705 align:middle line:84%
going to see that in
a few days, so I'm

00:10:38.705 --> 00:10:39.970 align:middle line:90%
going to really take that in.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's
the truth of life.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.290 align:middle line:84%
In our human programming,
we get into the game.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.080 align:middle line:84%
In our pures source
self, we will just

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.970 align:middle line:84%
experience everything
that's happening for us

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:53.550 align:middle line:90%
and just land in that.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.840 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the healing
journey is an interesting one,

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.820 align:middle line:84%
and I've talked to you in
advance just a little bit.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.620 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the
nature of the content,

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.500 align:middle line:84%
but not the details of it
because it will be for the Zs

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.480 align:middle line:90%
to field those questions.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.780 align:middle line:84%
So how do you feel
about launching in?

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Great.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You feel ready?

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yep.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.579 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so I'll let
you just take a moment

00:11:13.579 --> 00:11:15.450 align:middle line:84%
to do what you do, and
connect with the Zs,

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:18.690 align:middle line:90%
and we'll start our story.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:19.560 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: Good.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.360 align:middle line:10%
Welcome.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.520 align:middle line:10%
If we may, before we
begin, the conflict

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.400 align:middle line:10%
that you are in right now
is a world that many of you

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.250 align:middle line:10%
perceive as an extreme
conflict-- is, in fact, far

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.010 align:middle line:10%
more subtle than most of the
conflicts that any of you

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.470 align:middle line:10%
experienced in prior lifetimes.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.770 align:middle line:84%
That is the truth of this
more multi-dimensional time.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness has permeated
your planet, and thus the psyche

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.240 align:middle line:84%
and the energy field of
humanity more than ever before.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, even though
you may be focusing

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.730 align:middle line:84%
on what you perceive to
be external conflicts

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:54.720 align:middle line:84%
or the threat of external
planetary conflicts,

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.360 align:middle line:84%
you are also at
a time where much

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.270 align:middle line:84%
of what is moving through the
inner systems of all of you

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.780 align:middle line:84%
is a clearance of the
war of times past.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:08.790 align:middle line:84%
So as war is very much focused
on at this time on your planet,

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:12.060 align:middle line:84%
so, too, are so many of
you not just the awake

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.680 align:middle line:84%
or conscious beings
on the planet,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.700 align:middle line:84%
but all are processing
out the collective history

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.430 align:middle line:84%
of the damage, the destruction,
the loss of life force

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:23.820 align:middle line:90%
that results through war.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:28.880 align:middle line:84%
So we wanted to address that
before we get a little closer

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.852 align:middle line:84%
in on the human journey
through this story.

00:12:31.852 --> 00:12:33.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.800 align:middle line:84%
That is a very good
point you make,

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.260 align:middle line:84%
and we forget that
in our past history

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.510 align:middle line:84%
the trauma that started an aura
from living through some truly

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:46.020 align:middle line:84%
barbaric times, where
soldiers would come through

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.680 align:middle line:84%
and rape, and pillage, and raze
a whole village of people--

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:84%
just a slaughter, so to speak,
of peoples across the board.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.020 align:middle line:90%
We really-- you're right.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:59.580 align:middle line:84%
We have come into a much
more subtle way of doing

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.750 align:middle line:90%
this political war business.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.030 align:middle line:84%
There's not quite as, on
one level, traumatizing

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:08.850 align:middle line:84%
and hands on, but what happens
when the same dynamic is

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:11.670 align:middle line:84%
in effect, but you can't quite
touch, or taste, or see it,

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.840 align:middle line:84%
or feel it in exactly the
same way, but on some level,

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:19.020 align:middle line:84%
you're really feeling the
conflict in this subtlety.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.760 align:middle line:90%
How do people discern?

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, people are
not so clear about discerning,

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.310 align:middle line:90%
and nor should you be sometimes.

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.080 align:middle line:84%
What we mean by this is it
is important to deeply enter

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.240 align:middle line:84%
the energy that
you are clearing.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.750 align:middle line:84%
So to be able to
discern the difference

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.250 align:middle line:84%
will not always
be helpful to you.

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.880 align:middle line:84%
We are aware there is
a trend among those

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.370 align:middle line:84%
who are conscious
to try and identify

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:42.930 align:middle line:84%
what it is that you
are experiencing

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:45.210 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps move beyond
it, and yet the truth

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.630 align:middle line:84%
is moving beyond it will not
necessarily clear you of it.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.790 align:middle line:84%
It is a fine line for
consciousness seekers.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.490 align:middle line:84%
For, on the one
hand, they are here

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:57.600 align:middle line:84%
to help raise the frequency of
the planet by who they become

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.964 align:middle line:90%
and then what they emit.

00:13:58.964 --> 00:14:00.630 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
they are here to help

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.190 align:middle line:84%
raise the frequency
of the planet

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:06.060 align:middle line:84%
by taking on the energies
and transmuting them

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.300 align:middle line:84%
through their physical bodies,
through their human stories,

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.460 align:middle line:90%
through their energetic fields.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
those who would not even

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.550 align:middle line:84%
come close to any
level of discernment,

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:19.800 align:middle line:84%
for they are what you
might call a little lower

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.340 align:middle line:90%
down the karmic wheel.

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And here we have to
be careful, for there

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.720 align:middle line:84%
are notions of hierarchy
and better than other

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.690 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.060 align:middle line:84%
So when we say lower
down the karmic wheel,

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:84%
it is simply another point
of entry to the human game.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.230 align:middle line:84%
It is not necessarily
that that person is less

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.380 align:middle line:84%
than somebody who is in
a more elevated place.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.600 align:middle line:84%
It is simply a different
way of playing the game,

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.430 align:middle line:90%
a different point of focus.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.280 align:middle line:84%
There are, in fact, some
quite high frequency

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.380 align:middle line:84%
or high consciousness
beings who choose

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:53.130 align:middle line:84%
to enter the field of
humanity at a lower

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.610 align:middle line:84%
point than prior lifetimes
sometimes to what you might

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:59.380 align:middle line:84%
call help to shift
the frequency,

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:04.230 align:middle line:84%
but more importantly for
themselves to strengthen

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:08.250 align:middle line:84%
their own ability to work
with closely the energy

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:10.110 align:middle line:84%
field of humanity,
particularly if they

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.629 align:middle line:84%
are ones who are here in
service to that energy field.

00:15:13.629 --> 00:15:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, thank you.

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.440 align:middle line:84%
That was going to
be my next question.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:20.490 align:middle line:84%
At this point in time, as
we're going through a period--

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:23.460 align:middle line:84%
some think almost a
critical period of choice

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.830 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how we choose to
engage with our potentials

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:27.630 align:middle line:90%
in life--

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:30.660 align:middle line:84%
are there quite a few entities
from other realms that

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.870 align:middle line:84%
are here embodied as you
just spoke of at this time?

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: There are many.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:39.570 align:middle line:84%
In terms of other realms,
there are an enormous amount

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:46.050 align:middle line:84%
of realms that there can
be seen as what some of you

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:49.590 align:middle line:84%
would call other lifeforms,
other beings, races.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:51.840 align:middle line:84%
There are an enormous
amount that can be chosen,

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.020 align:middle line:84%
and yet the earth plane
has a limited number

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.270 align:middle line:90%
of beings who can enter.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:00.330 align:middle line:84%
There is what you might
call a force field

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:03.690 align:middle line:84%
around the Earth that
allows only a certain amount

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:07.800 align:middle line:84%
of embodied universality
on the planet,

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:12.580 align:middle line:84%
meaning the density of humanity
as a race is very specific.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.790 align:middle line:84%
It has a very
specific frequency,

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and therefore there
are only so many beings

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:21.240 align:middle line:84%
who can enter the
body of a human

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.360 align:middle line:84%
who have not been human
before, or who have not

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.780 align:middle line:84%
been what you might call
identified as human,

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:31.680 align:middle line:84%
for of course there are many who
exist on this planet who do not

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.340 align:middle line:84%
need to take the body of a
human, the form of a human,

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.430 align:middle line:84%
but can, in fact, be working
alongside human beings.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:41.730 align:middle line:84%
For example, where you
two are sitting right now,

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.440 align:middle line:90%
this place is full of beings.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.760 align:middle line:84%
They are just not the seen
kind to the human naked eye.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.270 align:middle line:90%
I am aware of that.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:54.150 align:middle line:84%
So Earth has-- because
of the actual vibratory

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.820 align:middle line:84%
rate of the people
that are embodied here,

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:59.490 align:middle line:84%
that is the limiting factor
as to which kind of beings

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:02.610 align:middle line:84%
can actually incarnate
physically here to assist

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.319 align:middle line:90%
humankind from higher realms?

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:07.619 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The best way we could
describe it is to be earthbound

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:84%
and certainly to be
in the human body it

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:13.079 align:middle line:84%
is a little like putting on
a very heavy weighted suit.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:84%
This is why so many who
are of angelic frequencies

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.010 align:middle line:90%
struggle here.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:20.609 align:middle line:84%
Those of you who have incarnated
who have high levels of angelic

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:23.670 align:middle line:84%
frequencies-- you
would be one of these--

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:27.240 align:middle line:84%
struggle to deal with
the weight of this place.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.360 align:middle line:84%
For you it can be a
certain kind of torture

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.330 align:middle line:84%
to be in that gravity if
you are that way inclined.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So you have to find a
way to coexist with it,

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.640 align:middle line:84%
and to find and seek
the light in life,

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.940 align:middle line:84%
and take special measures
which other humans might

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.782 align:middle line:90%
frown upon or not understand.

00:17:43.782 --> 00:17:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What kind of
measures do you speak of here?

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, we would talk
about clearing your energy

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:50.220 align:middle line:84%
field and making sure you are
going to the clearest energy

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.020 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.310 align:middle line:84%
So measures that can be
quite simple-- everything

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:56.130 align:middle line:84%
from putting yourself
in water, making sure

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:58.770 align:middle line:84%
that the energy of your home
or the places that you spend

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:03.990 align:middle line:84%
much time in are clear and free
of what we might call conflict

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:05.940 align:middle line:84%
energies, energies that
would bring you down,

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and likewise in your lives
making sure that you have found

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.540 align:middle line:84%
a way to be in those
places that you struggle--

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:16.260 align:middle line:84%
be that a relationship or an
environment-- in a way that

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.440 align:middle line:84%
does not deaden,
does not make you

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.170 align:middle line:84%
have to recoil from
yourself, take your spirit

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:23.610 align:middle line:90%
smaller into the body.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:25.770 align:middle line:84%
The biggest problem
for those of you

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.190 align:middle line:84%
that we are speaking to in
this area can be your spirit

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:31.890 align:middle line:84%
feels so small on
Earth compared to how

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:33.480 align:middle line:90%
you know your spirit to be.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.580 align:middle line:84%
You understand and
feel the vastness.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.230 align:middle line:84%
You remember it,
and therefore it

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:41.040 align:middle line:84%
can be quite painful to put
this heavy small suit on.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With the
Earth's frequencies

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.662 align:middle line:84%
changing as they
are, first I wouldn't

00:18:44.662 --> 00:18:45.870 align:middle line:90%
mind if you speak about that.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a subject that was spoken
about quite a bit in maybe even

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.070 align:middle line:90%
two decades, three decades ago.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:54.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not spoken about as much
now that the Earth herself

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:58.800 align:middle line:84%
is going through her own
vibratory shift and refinement.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.370 align:middle line:84%
How is that impacting
the ability of people

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:06.636 align:middle line:84%
to be with her, both on the end
that are still at the beginning

00:19:06.636 --> 00:19:08.010 align:middle line:84%
end of the karmic
wheel and those

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:10.442 align:middle line:84%
who have been here a long
time or have come to help?

00:19:10.442 --> 00:19:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, many
of you will notice--

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.044 align:middle line:84%
particularly those of
you who are in touch

00:19:14.044 --> 00:19:16.335 align:middle line:84%
with what you would call
extraterrestrial frequencies--

00:19:16.335 --> 00:19:18.815 align:middle line:84%
that there has been a lot
less of that in recent years.

00:19:18.815 --> 00:19:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is because
the Earth has

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:23.970 align:middle line:84%
gone into what you might
call a kind of quarantine.

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:27.150 align:middle line:84%
The touch paper was lit
on the Earth's change.

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.490 align:middle line:84%
This was lit many,
many, many decades ago,

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.160 align:middle line:84%
and in recent decades,
things have been heating up.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And now you are in what we
might call an implosion phase.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.100 align:middle line:84%
That is where
everything that needed

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.110 align:middle line:84%
to come to the surface that
was essentially black--

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:42.090 align:middle line:90%
think of it as heavy oil--

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:43.260 align:middle line:90%
is now rising.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it is
hard for other beings

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:48.450 align:middle line:84%
to be too close to the
Earth, but that does not

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.040 align:middle line:90%
mean you have been abandoned.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.360 align:middle line:90%
This was always the design.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.180 align:middle line:84%
There was an awareness that,
once the chemical reaction had

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.700 align:middle line:84%
been set in motion, it would
be important for the scientists

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.800 align:middle line:84%
to step outside the
room behind the glass,

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.080 align:middle line:84%
but it does not mean
they are not monitoring.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.300 align:middle line:84%
So you are going to see that
this will occur for another 4,

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.170 align:middle line:84%
5, 6, 7 years in
terms of your planet,

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and then there will
be what we would

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.240 align:middle line:84%
call a wave of more universal
consciousness beginning

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.650 align:middle line:90%
to permeate the Earth--

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:17.160 align:middle line:84%
the understanding that the
Earth is part of a vast galaxy.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And in small baby
steps, that will

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.500 align:middle line:84%
start to permeate mass
consciousness more and more,

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.310 align:middle line:84%
but this coming 4,
5, 6, 7 years you

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.220 align:middle line:84%
are going to be going through
this internal implosion.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.570 align:middle line:84%
What we will say is many of you
who are of lighter frequencies

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:35.190 align:middle line:84%
or are seeking
lighter frequencies--

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and we should qualify
here many of you

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.230 align:middle line:84%
who hold light frequencies--
you do feel heavy, also.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.450 align:middle line:84%
You have your days or
your hours of heaviness,

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.250 align:middle line:90%
so do not be deceived.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:45.840 align:middle line:90%
You are on the Earth wheel.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Therefore you will go up
and down through the scale,

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.130 align:middle line:84%
but those of you who
seek the light-- you

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:51.840 align:middle line:84%
will be able to
maintain connection

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.960 align:middle line:84%
to the beings who are here to
hold light for you, for there

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.320 align:middle line:84%
is an enormous amount of
stabilized grounded light

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.840 align:middle line:84%
on the planet now in a way
that there was not so much

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.030 align:middle line:90%
even 10 or 20 years ago.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.550 align:middle line:84%
That may come as a surprise
to some listening who

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:08.520 align:middle line:84%
feel that there is this
abandonment occurring

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.490 align:middle line:84%
or that everything is getting
a little crazy out there,

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:15.240 align:middle line:84%
but it is getting crazy
because of the quartz that

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.780 align:middle line:84%
exists in the Earth that
is able to stabilize

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.200 align:middle line:84%
all of the frequencies
of this implosion.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
interesting, and this

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.810 align:middle line:84%
seems like it's a
non-sequitur, but perhaps not.

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:32.730 align:middle line:84%
I just-- many people were
recently in Tucson, Arizona

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.725 align:middle line:84%
at the gem and
mineral show, which

00:21:34.725 --> 00:21:36.600 align:middle line:84%
is the largest in the
world, where they bring

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.150 align:middle line:84%
in massive levels
of quartz from all

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.720 align:middle line:84%
over the planet,
particularly Brazil

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.110 align:middle line:84%
and also other
places in the world,

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:47.070 align:middle line:84%
but that would be
one of the big ones.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And I've always
wondered what impact

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:53.490 align:middle line:84%
does it have on Earth
to take her minerals,

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:56.495 align:middle line:84%
and remove them, and
bring them to the surface?

00:21:56.495 --> 00:21:57.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they
haven't disappeared,

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:00.630 align:middle line:84%
but they're not at the core
where they were being grown.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.355 align:middle line:90%
How does that impact Earth?

00:22:02.355 --> 00:22:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We would
say two things.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.600 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, there
is an expectation

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.900 align:middle line:84%
that this will happen,
for that is what man does.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.120 align:middle line:90%
Man takes what man wants.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So on that scale
of things, there

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:19.410 align:middle line:84%
is a distress that is
caused to the balance.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:24.510 align:middle line:84%
However, with that said, there
is far more quartz available

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:26.880 align:middle line:90%
than man could possibly dig up.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, what we would
say is it is important

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:33.030 align:middle line:84%
that those who need the
quartz are finding the quartz.

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.100 align:middle line:84%
What we would say about
quartz specifically

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:39.730 align:middle line:90%
is it is the angel frequency.

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:42.810 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, for those
who are interacting with it

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:45.030 align:middle line:84%
or seeking it, it
will help those

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.820 align:middle line:84%
who feel that they are
floating above this Earth

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.040 align:middle line:84%
but not of this Earth
more of the time

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.770 align:middle line:84%
to feel grounded and
capable of being here,

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and we should qualify
something here.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:57.860 align:middle line:84%
There are many who will
think of themselves

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.810 align:middle line:84%
as other because of these
descriptors that we are using--

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.510 align:middle line:84%
the idea of being a lightworker,
higher consciousness,

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:05.070 align:middle line:90%
of angelic consciousness.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
truth of humanity

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:10.800 align:middle line:84%
is no human being
feels deeply connected

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.550 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the tribe.

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:15.240 align:middle line:84%
So separation and
loneliness is experienced

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.800 align:middle line:84%
for every individual,
and that is

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.250 align:middle line:84%
because of how the human game
has been set up for so long.

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:22.470 align:middle line:84%
So separation and
loneliness are as much

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:26.560 align:middle line:84%
a part of the game as
connection, joining, love,

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.630 align:middle line:90%
friendship.

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:32.160 align:middle line:84%
So we will just say that, if
you feel that you are alone here

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.470 align:middle line:84%
or isolated here,
you are feeling

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:37.320 align:middle line:84%
a universal frequency
of the human game

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.970 align:middle line:84%
that all are feeling
the differences.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Some are not aware
of that feeling

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:47.067 align:middle line:84%
and are acting upon it to
try and bypass or cover it.

00:23:47.067 --> 00:23:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good point.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:49.060 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree more.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.184 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I've ever
spoken to a human being who

00:23:51.184 --> 00:23:54.810 align:middle line:84%
down at the very core doesn't
have this sense of loneliness

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:57.250 align:middle line:90%
or isolation on some level.

00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Everyone-- so that's a
wonderful point you make.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Going back to the subject
of crystals and that

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.690 align:middle line:84%
if some someone should come
in possession of the crystal

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:09.410 align:middle line:84%
to work with, how
would you best suggest

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:11.880 align:middle line:90%
a person utilize the crystal?

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.784 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a very
confused subject.

00:24:14.784 --> 00:24:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
if we may, we will

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.260 align:middle line:84%
use an example
here of Lee, for he

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.650 align:middle line:84%
is at this point in
possession of a crystal

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:27.540 align:middle line:84%
that we will show you that he
has been using specifically

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:28.890 align:middle line:90%
around his heart chakra.

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:35.250 align:middle line:84%
He was finding that his heart
was a little fluctuating

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:37.830 align:middle line:84%
throughout the year
of 2016, as were many,

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:41.760 align:middle line:84%
and toward the end of the year
this was a crystal that he was

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.130 align:middle line:90%
using with a group in Hawaii.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And so he had this crystal
made onto this necklace

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.880 align:middle line:84%
so that he can wear it
by his heart chakra.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:54.270 align:middle line:84%
It helps him to feel stronger
and stabilized whenever

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:56.670 align:middle line:84%
he notices he is
feeling less than that

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:58.710 align:middle line:90%
or just to support himself.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.360 align:middle line:84%
So what we would
say to any of you

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.175 align:middle line:84%
is to think about a
certain part of your body

00:25:03.175 --> 00:25:04.800 align:middle line:84%
that you struggle
with, and it does not

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.550 align:middle line:90%
need to be in necklace form.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:12.360 align:middle line:84%
You can take this
stone and place it

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.780 align:middle line:90%
anywhere upon your body.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.930 align:middle line:84%
You may lie on your
bed and place it

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:17.520 align:middle line:90%
at a certain part of your body.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Many of you would like to put
it here on your third eye,

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.500 align:middle line:84%
for the third eye
is very confused

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.090 align:middle line:90%
for many at the moment.

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:27.090 align:middle line:84%
The third eye that
has seen what is going

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:30.300 align:middle line:84%
on in this place at this
time that is troubled by all

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.570 align:middle line:84%
of the world events
and is also going

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:36.090 align:middle line:84%
through a shift of
consciousness where

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:39.630 align:middle line:84%
being able to tap into
synchronicity and telepathy

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:40.800 align:middle line:90%
is on the rise.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.860 align:middle line:84%
So many people have what we
would call confused third eyes

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.900 align:middle line:84%
at this point before
in two or three years

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:49.770 align:middle line:84%
that settles down and pops
into more clarity for them.

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:52.080 align:middle line:84%
So people can take
the stone that they

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.850 align:middle line:90%
feel it resonates with them--

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:57.210 align:middle line:84%
or specifically, quartz--
and have it on their being,

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:59.550 align:middle line:84%
have it around them,
and work with it

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:02.610 align:middle line:84%
as they feel they need to
as if it is medicine, for,

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:05.980 align:middle line:84%
in frequency terms,
it is medicine.

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Will its own
intelligence make itself known,

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:13.250 align:middle line:84%
or is it best to, for
example, infuse it

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:15.305 align:middle line:90%
with a very specific intention?

00:26:15.305 --> 00:26:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It depends very
much on the consciousness

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:19.680 align:middle line:84%
of the individual as to
whether its intelligence will

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.580 align:middle line:90%
make itself known.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Some people do not necessarily
want the intelligence

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.540 align:middle line:90%
of the crystal.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:25.780 align:middle line:90%
They simply want the energy.

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:29.040 align:middle line:84%
You can think of this the same
way with friends in your life.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.500 align:middle line:84%
There are some friends that
you go to for wisdom and some

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.310 align:middle line:90%
that you go to for a hug.

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:37.080 align:middle line:84%
So people feel that very
differently around crystals,

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.500 align:middle line:84%
but in terms of intentions,
you can simply make sure

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.470 align:middle line:84%
that, first of all, it
is clear, for many of you

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.090 align:middle line:84%
are taking crystals
that have gone

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:47.340 align:middle line:84%
through many different
energies, and taking them home,

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:51.120 align:middle line:84%
and not cleansing them or
putting them in salt water

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.170 align:middle line:84%
so that they can become
pure and of your frequency.

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And then an intent
is a wonderful way

00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:01.080 align:middle line:84%
to focus and program what it
is that you bring that crystal

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:04.230 align:middle line:84%
in for, but we would recommend
like with your own intentions

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.600 align:middle line:84%
about your life that you
review and renew these

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.407 align:middle line:90%
as time goes on.

00:27:08.407 --> 00:27:09.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've covered a lot
of interesting territory

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:16.210 align:middle line:84%
that was not in the program
which is absolutely fabulous,

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:18.270 align:middle line:84%
and I always appreciated
that about you.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Are you ready for us to
launch into the conversation

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.782 align:middle line:84%
about the incarnation
path and the way

00:27:23.782 --> 00:27:25.365 align:middle line:84%
this all works with
the human species?

00:27:25.365 --> 00:27:26.165 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:27:26.165 --> 00:27:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Can we go there now?

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:31.830 align:middle line:84%
So the first question I have
is something that is normally

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:38.220 align:middle line:84%
not asked, and that is, how
much influence does a soul have

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.310 align:middle line:84%
over the developing
fetus of the body?

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And what is the nature
of its connection

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.930 align:middle line:84%
during those fragile
early months?

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Far less
than many of you

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:middle line:84%
perceive, and we
say this because we

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.150 align:middle line:84%
are aware of the belief
field on the planet.

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:56.010 align:middle line:84%
So the fetus development
is very much connected

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:59.250 align:middle line:84%
to the parent and
parents of this child

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.230 align:middle line:84%
far more so than
the soul coming in.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.900 align:middle line:84%
If we were to put it
in a more general way,

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.030 align:middle line:84%
there are so many
opportunities for all of you

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:09.180 align:middle line:84%
to incarnate there is
often this idea among some

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.120 align:middle line:84%
that you are fixed to
one family, one choice,

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.280 align:middle line:84%
but just as you have
many death windows,

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.870 align:middle line:84%
there are many
points of incarnation

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:18.170 align:middle line:84%
that you might be
choosing at one time,

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:21.360 align:middle line:84%
but depending on whether or not
that mother and those parents

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.510 align:middle line:84%
are ready for the child, are
ready for what is coming in,

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:28.800 align:middle line:84%
the fetus either will or
will not take full form.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:32.310 align:middle line:84%
So often a soul will
line up with a mother who

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:35.490 align:middle line:84%
is going to give birth,
and then the baby

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:37.270 align:middle line:90%
is not going to go full term.

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:40.410 align:middle line:84%
It is not going to be born,
but for those few months,

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:43.380 align:middle line:84%
there is an energetic
interaction that takes place,

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:46.020 align:middle line:84%
and then at the point that it
is decided that this is not

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.750 align:middle line:84%
the soul or the time
for that mother,

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:51.960 align:middle line:84%
the baby is lost as
you would call it.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.680 align:middle line:84%
So an experience
of parenting takes

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.540 align:middle line:90%
place in a very subtle way.

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.940 align:middle line:84%
The truest form of
parenting, which is truly

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.969 align:middle line:90%
connection between two souls--

00:29:01.969 --> 00:29:04.260 align:middle line:84%
we are aware that parenting
has a very different nature

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.830 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:08.610 align:middle line:84%
It is more about teaching
people unconditional love,

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:11.250 align:middle line:84%
but when it is simply
the fetus stage,

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:12.990 align:middle line:84%
this is an energetic
connection that

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:14.940 align:middle line:84%
happens between
mother and child,

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:18.510 align:middle line:84%
but we would say that the mother
and to a slightly lesser degree

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:21.720 align:middle line:84%
the father of the child are
dominant in the decision that

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.810 align:middle line:84%
takes place around the
lifespan of that baby

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:27.735 align:middle line:84%
and whether it is
going to be fully born.

00:29:27.735 --> 00:29:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very interesting.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:29.790 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:33.900 align:middle line:84%
The reason I asked this question
is because of something that--

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.240 align:middle line:84%
it was a statement that came
when I was in the crossover

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.470 align:middle line:84%
place between coming out of
dream time into wakefulness,

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.510 align:middle line:90%
and so I was able to recall it.

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And I've only asked a couple
other people about this,

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:49.350 align:middle line:84%
and the statement was this,
and it had to do with the fact

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:52.440 align:middle line:84%
that I had been meeting
with a fairly high profile

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:56.640 align:middle line:84%
person in the field of
consciousness and science.

00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And he was in one of the
presidential administrations,

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:04.590 align:middle line:84%
and he was writing a book
about this particular subject,

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:07.380 align:middle line:84%
the organizing principle
behind the development

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.840 align:middle line:90%
of the human brain slash mind.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And so when I woke
the next morning

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:16.170 align:middle line:84%
I heard that the organizing
principle behind the coherence

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:18.390 align:middle line:84%
in the development
of the human mind

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:22.050 align:middle line:84%
was the intention of
the soul, and so that's

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:25.890 align:middle line:84%
why I've wondered how much
effect does the soul have

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:29.280 align:middle line:84%
on that before the baby is
actually-- before they actually

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.940 align:middle line:90%
embody into the physical baby?

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:36.150 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: And we would say that
the experience of the deepening

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:40.920 align:middle line:10%
of that intent begins in the
last few months of inception

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:44.220 align:middle line:10%
of the child before
the birth, but there

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:48.720 align:middle line:10%
is an agreement that
takes place between parent

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.060 align:middle line:10%
and the child coming
in beforehand,

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.100 align:middle line:10%
because what the
soul is going to do

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.840 align:middle line:10%
is enter into the
ancestral energy

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.180 align:middle line:10%
field of that
genetic line, which

00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:01.150 align:middle line:10%
in itself is the heavy suit that
we were talking about earlier.

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:04.950 align:middle line:84%
So the soul is electing to come
in with their own intention

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:07.110 align:middle line:84%
of what they are going
to clear and help

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:10.909 align:middle line:84%
to heal in the genetic line
of that particular group

00:31:10.909 --> 00:31:13.200 align:middle line:84%
that they are coming through
directly through the birth

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.720 align:middle line:84%
pool, but then also
the interaction

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:17.920 align:middle line:90%
with humanity as a whole.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.640 align:middle line:84%
So we would say that
the intent becomes

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.600 align:middle line:84%
a lot more experiential
at the point of birth,

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:28.240 align:middle line:84%
but there is a
convergence of desire

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.380 align:middle line:90%
that takes place beforehand.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I've noticed in my
own past as just kind of a fun

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:38.130 align:middle line:84%
thing to do with
friends and relatives--

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:39.660 align:middle line:84%
I'll do a baby
reading and connect

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.660 align:middle line:84%
with the entity in the last
few days before the birth,

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.370 align:middle line:84%
and they seem very
close to the body,

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:47.380 align:middle line:84%
very present, very able
to share their likes,

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.920 align:middle line:84%
dislikes, and hopes for
this particular incarnation.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
that I love doing,

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.300 align:middle line:84%
and they seem to love being
able to share that knowledge.

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
the time at which--

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.280 align:middle line:84%
how we can all operate
better in this way

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.430 align:middle line:84%
with communicating with our
child before the child is born,

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:04.560 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's through
an intermediary,

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.670 align:middle line:84%
and when that really strong
presence of that child--

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:11.144 align:middle line:84%
the personality that's going
to enter that body is present?

00:32:11.144 --> 00:32:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We would
say the seven to nine

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:16.200 align:middle line:84%
month phase is when things
get a lot more, shall we say,

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.310 align:middle line:90%
locked in.

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:19.020 align:middle line:90%
The merge is more full.

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.540 align:middle line:84%
However, we will also
point out that there

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:26.400 align:middle line:84%
are many on the planet who
are open to how this works who

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.200 align:middle line:84%
can feel the energy
of their child

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.570 align:middle line:84%
before it even is
conceived in the body.

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:35.560 align:middle line:84%
This happens for many
because the souls are always,

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.980 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, waiting,
and when we say this,

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.050 align:middle line:84%
we do not mean they
have nothing else to do.

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:43.350 align:middle line:84%
What we simply mean that
there is an agreement that

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:46.290 align:middle line:84%
is in place often
for many, many years

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.840 align:middle line:84%
in advance between
souls who incarnate

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:52.620 align:middle line:84%
because many of the
existing understanding

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:56.130 align:middle line:84%
will focus very much on
the individual nature

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:58.200 align:middle line:84%
of your incarnation,
and yet the truth is you

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.880 align:middle line:90%
incarnate in groups.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Very few of you are choosing to
incarnate without a whole soul

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:04.860 align:middle line:90%
group being present.

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:08.060 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to break it
down into individual bodies,

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:11.580 align:middle line:84%
there may be 20, 30,
40, 60, 100 people

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:15.330 align:middle line:84%
that you are incarnating at
the same time with who have all

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:19.050 align:middle line:84%
been together before, may have
worked off world energetically

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:22.260 align:middle line:84%
to help clear certain
energy fields that they

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:23.550 align:middle line:90%
have become masters of.

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:26.280 align:middle line:84%
So for example, those
who have been involved

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.610 align:middle line:84%
in war and conflict are often
bringing energy balancing

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:32.280 align:middle line:84%
once they are outside the
body to those areas of war

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.210 align:middle line:90%
and conflict.

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:35.910 align:middle line:84%
It is what some of you
might refer to as karma.

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:37.950 align:middle line:84%
We call it the
knowledge of now they

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:41.220 align:middle line:84%
have embodied the
very energies of what

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:43.500 align:middle line:90%
creates war and division.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.690 align:middle line:84%
They can then start
to bring frequencies

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:47.460 align:middle line:84%
that are the
balancing act to that

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:49.170 align:middle line:90%
once they are out of the body.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:53.340 align:middle line:84%
So we will say that to
you-- that very few of you

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:54.330 align:middle line:90%
incarnate alone.

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:57.480 align:middle line:84%
That is where this myth of
being alone and separate

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:01.860 align:middle line:84%
is important to understand it
is part of the human animal

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:02.720 align:middle line:90%
to feel that way.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.100 align:middle line:84%
It is not part of the soul, for
the soul does not feel alone,

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.159 align:middle line:84%
and many of you would
agree with that when you

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:10.380 align:middle line:90%
experience your soul journeys.

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.900 align:middle line:90%
You incarnate with a vast group.

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
and I've often wondered--

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:17.699 align:middle line:84%
because it seems that
there is some evidence

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:20.370 align:middle line:84%
for this statement--
that the being that

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:23.699 align:middle line:84%
is wishing to incarnate
may even have a helping

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:27.000 align:middle line:84%
hand in assembling
matches, for example,

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.690 align:middle line:84%
from the other side to see that
two people from this soul group

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.840 align:middle line:84%
come together so that they can
have that pathway of birth.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.280 align:middle line:90%
Does that happen?

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.969 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yes, but also because
of the nature of the impact

00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:41.159 align:middle line:90%
that they will bring.

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:44.880 align:middle line:84%
A great deal of the plan,
if you like, for the Earth

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.820 align:middle line:84%
is to see how elevated
the consciousness can

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:53.100 align:middle line:84%
become during humanity's phase
and beyond humanity's phase.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:55.530 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that is most important

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:57.960 align:middle line:84%
between these
togetherness aspects

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.020 align:middle line:84%
is when you get two
people who come together

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:04.110 align:middle line:84%
in a strong union they
multiply the effect that they

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:07.020 align:middle line:84%
can be of what we would
call benevolent effect

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:09.540 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now that this
decision has been made--

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:16.830 align:middle line:84%
the little vehicle--
the baby is gestating.

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:19.840 align:middle line:84%
The soul is coming in closer
in the last trimester,

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.840 align:middle line:84%
the last couple of
months, actually.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:27.630 align:middle line:84%
At what point is there an
actual joining of soul and body?

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:30.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We would say that
this starts in the seven month

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:32.790 align:middle line:90%
phase in a more dense way.

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:38.220 align:middle line:84%
So this is also why premature
children often, shall we say,

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:40.380 align:middle line:84%
a little more
alarmed by the world,

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:43.230 align:middle line:84%
for they have only
just started to anchor

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:44.910 align:middle line:90%
into this physical experience.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
they are out,

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:51.030 align:middle line:84%
but that can also make
premature children particularly

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:52.890 align:middle line:90%
magical or gifted.

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:55.470 align:middle line:84%
You will see this a
lot with those souls

00:35:55.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:middle line:84%
who did not lose the connection
to their soul-hood so early.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:04.260 align:middle line:84%
So what we will say here
is that the imprint starts

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.780 align:middle line:84%
deepening at the
seven month period,

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.090 align:middle line:84%
and then the eight and
nine month period the soul

00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:13.290 align:middle line:84%
starts to forget or leave
source energy in a deeper way

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and go into a very
internalized focus, which

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:19.950 align:middle line:84%
is why the escape
from the mother's body

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:21.570 align:middle line:90%
feels like an escape for many.

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Some will come out
peacefully, but it

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:27.150 align:middle line:84%
gets very constricted for the
child, as well as the mother,

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:29.470 align:middle line:90%
in those final weeks and months.

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:32.160 align:middle line:84%
So it is an important
breaking out of the chrysalis

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.840 align:middle line:84%
that the baby goes
through, which

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.450 align:middle line:84%
is very traumatic
to some, and to

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:38.190 align:middle line:84%
others feels like
the arrival point

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:41.280 align:middle line:90%
of their next level of destiny.

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Generally
speaking, what

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:46.110 align:middle line:84%
is this level of
conscious awareness

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:50.490 align:middle line:84%
of the baby in those first
delicate weeks after birth?

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Some say that they
still have memory,

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:55.110 align:middle line:84%
and it hasn't shut
down completely yet.

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Others-- I think
you were just saying

00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:00.070 align:middle line:84%
that the memories start shutting
down even earlier than that.

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about what
the baby is going through?

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It depends
on the individual,

00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:07.300 align:middle line:84%
for those who are
more programmed

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:09.460 align:middle line:84%
to remember throughout
their life tended

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:10.774 align:middle line:90%
to remember in their childhood.

00:37:10.774 --> 00:37:12.190 align:middle line:84%
They can often be
the ones who had

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:14.500 align:middle line:84%
the most painful childhoods,
for they were trying

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.140 align:middle line:84%
to forget something
that they did not

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:20.290 align:middle line:84%
want to forget because it was
too painful to remember it

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:22.720 align:middle line:84%
in contrast to what
they had been born into,

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.150 align:middle line:84%
meaning the lighter,
brighter, more connected world

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:29.740 align:middle line:84%
they had to come from
suddenly felt gone to them

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:31.780 align:middle line:84%
as they arrived
here on this planet,

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:34.690 align:middle line:84%
where that lightness and
brightness can exist,

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:37.250 align:middle line:84%
but it has to be focused
and targeted by humans.

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:39.490 align:middle line:90%
It is not just the norm.

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:43.180 align:middle line:84%
What we will say
here is that many

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:44.990 align:middle line:84%
of the children
who entered first--

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:48.670 align:middle line:84%
it is a little like going from
blurred vision into focus,

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:52.000 align:middle line:84%
and that can take one to
two years for some children.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.900 align:middle line:84%
So what they are seeing is a
blurry version of the world,

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:57.970 align:middle line:84%
meaning they are
seeing the energies,

00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:01.180 align:middle line:84%
the beings that many of you
notice that certain animals--

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.640 align:middle line:90%
cats, certain dogs--

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:03.910 align:middle line:90%
will see.

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:06.400 align:middle line:84%
This is part of what
they are experiencing,

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and yet they start to learn very
quickly that their sharp focus

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.400 align:middle line:84%
needs to be on the
human world, for that

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.490 align:middle line:84%
is where seemingly all
of the useful activity

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:16.870 align:middle line:90%
is taking place.

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:19.600 align:middle line:84%
So once they start to
focus on the human world,

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.280 align:middle line:84%
they start to let go of what
they are perceiving here

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.080 align:middle line:90%
energetically.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:25.000 align:middle line:84%
So it is not just that
they are remembering

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:25.875 align:middle line:90%
where they came from.

00:38:25.875 --> 00:38:28.208 align:middle line:84%
It is that they are seeing
beyond the veil on the planet

00:38:28.208 --> 00:38:29.010 align:middle line:90%
also.

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And is it serving
humanity at this time,

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.540 align:middle line:84%
and is there a point where it
will no longer serve humanity

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:41.820 align:middle line:84%
for the human to forget what's
come before upon incarnating?

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: No, that
will not be the case,

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:47.310 align:middle line:84%
for humanity is going through
its own evolutionary cycle,

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:49.740 align:middle line:84%
and this next 1000
to 2000 years is

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:53.790 align:middle line:84%
going to be the deciding
factor for humanity as to what

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:57.000 align:middle line:84%
comes next where
humanity is concerned.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.660 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness needs to rise
on this planet for humanity

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:03.000 align:middle line:84%
to survive as a
species, and we say

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.420 align:middle line:84%
that not for alarm, for,
remember, as a soul energy,

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:10.380 align:middle line:84%
you are incarnated into many
different forms in what you

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:13.260 align:middle line:84%
might call a lifetime, but we
do not give it such definition,

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:16.560 align:middle line:84%
for there is no
search definition.

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in
other words, we will

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.912 align:middle line:84%
start bringing memory in with
us as the times moved forward.

00:39:21.912 --> 00:39:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It will
be something that

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:26.370 align:middle line:84%
will be far more
awake in the process

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:30.660 align:middle line:84%
once people have come to support
that in what we would call

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:33.360 align:middle line:84%
their parenting, but
then we will also

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:36.240 align:middle line:84%
say there will come a
point where humanity will

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.370 align:middle line:84%
go through its own shift
because of this remembrance,

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:43.140 align:middle line:84%
meaning the dense
form of humanity

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:46.860 align:middle line:84%
will no longer be
the role, or shall

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:48.690 align:middle line:84%
we say, the suit
that consciousness

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:50.215 align:middle line:90%
takes on the Earth.

00:39:50.215 --> 00:39:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know a
couple of little two

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.430 align:middle line:84%
and three-year-olds
that are just

00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:56.410 align:middle line:84%
amazing in their memory and
the things they come up with,

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:58.980 align:middle line:84%
and so it's already
beginning to happen.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.630 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing the
precursors to that

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:03.420 align:middle line:84%
in some of the children being
born now, and it's really--

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.160 align:middle line:84%
it's quite lovely,
but it's also somewhat

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.800 align:middle line:84%
difficult on these children,
and sometimes alarming

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.620 align:middle line:90%
to their parents.

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:11.500 align:middle line:84%
So we'll see more of
that in the future.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we go into once
the baby is in the body

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.500 align:middle line:84%
and this period, this
blurriness starts

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:21.090 align:middle line:84%
going into more
practical sharp focus,

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:23.900 align:middle line:84%
is there any more comment
you want to make about that?

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.150 align:middle line:90%
We've been through this a lot.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:27.720 align:middle line:84%
We each know what the journey
of being human more or less

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:28.860 align:middle line:90%
entails--

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:32.094 align:middle line:84%
before I go to the process
of exiting the body.

00:40:32.094 --> 00:40:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well
first of all, there

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:35.250 align:middle line:84%
is the motor
function of the body

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:37.860 align:middle line:84%
itself and learning
that experience.

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Again, we will give this
analogy of the heavy suit.

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So there is an enormous amount
of joy, and presence, and light

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:48.120 align:middle line:84%
that the baby will feel, for
generally a great deal of that

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.400 align:middle line:84%
will be projected
onto the child.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.800 align:middle line:84%
However, it depends, for
there are some children who

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.470 align:middle line:84%
come in and go into
what you would know

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:58.560 align:middle line:84%
as difficult childhoods where
there was not a lot of love,

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.820 align:middle line:84%
or there is a resentment
put toward them.

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:03.630 align:middle line:84%
So they have to fight
for the survival

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:06.630 align:middle line:84%
of their consciousness,
not just their physicality.

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:12.240 align:middle line:84%
So as the baby enters and begins
to remember what this world is

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:15.000 align:middle line:84%
and start to interact
with it, the first points

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.920 align:middle line:84%
of reference that many
children will make

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:20.460 align:middle line:84%
is a merging with or a
reaction to the energy

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:23.070 align:middle line:84%
fields of the humans
they are most around.

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:25.980 align:middle line:84%
So they will either merge with
those energy fields in order

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:29.370 align:middle line:84%
to not just survive,
but also to learn,

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:32.880 align:middle line:84%
or they will reject those energy
fields if they are repellent

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.840 align:middle line:84%
to the child, or the child
cannot and as we would say

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.450 align:middle line:90%
here, merge with that energy.

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:43.440 align:middle line:84%
So it is a very precarious
time on the development

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.280 align:middle line:84%
of what you know as the adult,
for those formative years

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:51.660 align:middle line:84%
in energetic terms truly do lay
down the imprint of where you

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:54.630 align:middle line:84%
are going to be able to go
in terms of your openness

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:58.500 align:middle line:84%
to life based on your connection
with those humans you are most

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.106 align:middle line:90%
around at first.

00:42:00.106 --> 00:42:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
makes total sense,

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and that does bring
up a question,

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:07.560 align:middle line:84%
and that has to do with,
because this planet is so

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.740 align:middle line:84%
ordered toward survival,
physical survival,

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.840 align:middle line:84%
survival even of the
ego and so forth.

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:18.750 align:middle line:84%
There are these very hard set
programs that each culture has,

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:22.380 align:middle line:84%
and to me the saddest
thing is to see

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.450 align:middle line:84%
a bright, sparkly
little child who

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:26.940 align:middle line:90%
is just brimming with life--

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:29.220 align:middle line:84%
their eyes are
dancing with light--

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:32.550 align:middle line:84%
and then start programming
them into a specific outcome,

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:36.360 align:middle line:84%
having society, institutions,
and the parents do this.

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.640 align:middle line:84%
What can you say to
parents at this time

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:41.850 align:middle line:84%
about not snuffing the
creativity, remembrance,

00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:43.620 align:middle line:84%
and life out of
their own children?

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: To remember
that your children come

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:48.810 align:middle line:84%
in as people who have been
fully formed people before.

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Even those who are new to the
Earth-- they have had journeys

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:54.660 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth, and some of
them may have surpassed you

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:58.170 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their own
development, and this in itself

00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:00.150 align:middle line:84%
reveals the tricky
path of the parent,

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:04.200 align:middle line:84%
for the parent has to be willing
to identify their own ego

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.790 align:middle line:90%
wounds as they come up.

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Many parents will get
defensive around what

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:11.490 align:middle line:84%
their child is allowed
to experience based

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:13.620 align:middle line:90%
on what they did or didn't get.

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:16.470 align:middle line:84%
So the best thing you can do
is to listen to your child

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:19.080 align:middle line:84%
and observe your child
as much as possible.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Many parents get into the
idea of an authority role

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:25.230 align:middle line:84%
and tend to become everything
to the child-- taking care

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:31.320 align:middle line:84%
of too many of the child's needs
almost as an automatic response

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:34.230 align:middle line:84%
to the idea that they have to
be a parent, yet if you sit back

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and listen, you will
see that the child

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:38.670 align:middle line:84%
is bringing into your
world the frequency

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:40.260 align:middle line:90%
that you, too, have forgotten.

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And if it makes
you uncomfortable,

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:45.660 align:middle line:84%
it is good to be able to sit
with that discomfort at first,

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:49.560 align:middle line:84%
but most parents who are
what we would call conscious

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.050 align:middle line:84%
are much more willing
to go with this idea

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and to support the
children that are

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:58.590 align:middle line:84%
coming in now, which is a
very different kind of energy.

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:00.390 align:middle line:84%
We would say that the
children entering now

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:03.120 align:middle line:90%
are far more fierce.

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:07.890 align:middle line:84%
We say they are fierce not as
in they are aggressive or cold,

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:10.710 align:middle line:84%
but they do not have the
time that many of you

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:12.420 align:middle line:90%
had when you were incarnating.

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:16.350 align:middle line:84%
They do not have the luxury
of that long drawn out

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:17.760 align:middle line:90%
period toward this time.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.290 align:middle line:90%
They are being born into it.

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:21.000 align:middle line:84%
So they come in
wired for strength,

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.520 align:middle line:84%
and that can be challenging
to some parents.

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.870 align:middle line:90%
They still need your guidance.

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:27.360 align:middle line:84%
They still need your
leadership around some

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:31.920 align:middle line:84%
of the areas of life that they
need to find their way in,

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.870 align:middle line:84%
but they are here to teach
you and the world as much

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:36.670 align:middle line:90%
as anything.

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:39.097 align:middle line:84%
So giving them that
space is vital.

00:44:39.097 --> 00:44:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:42.420 align:middle line:84%
That was very thorough
and beautiful response.

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Very lovely guidance.

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:46.350 align:middle line:84%
So now we'll allow
our child to grow up.

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:47.310 align:middle line:90%
We age.

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:48.990 align:middle line:84%
We do what we do in
life, and now we're

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:53.400 align:middle line:84%
ready to leave our body,
and when that time comes,

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:56.700 align:middle line:84%
people who witness this have
very different experiences

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:58.400 align:middle line:84%
of it when they're
with a person who

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.210 align:middle line:90%
is ready to depart the body.

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:03.581 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about what's
happening from there end?

00:45:03.581 --> 00:45:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: What is
happening for them

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.350 align:middle line:84%
is they are going in and
out of the death realms.

00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:10.440 align:middle line:84%
This is why those
who care for a loved

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:14.130 align:middle line:84%
one in the final
stages of sickness,

00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:17.070 align:middle line:84%
or should we say
life before death,

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:19.380 align:middle line:84%
can often feel quite
deathly for months

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:20.970 align:middle line:84%
afterwards themselves,
for they, too,

00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:22.910 align:middle line:90%
have entered the death realms.

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:24.990 align:middle line:84%
What we mean by
the death realms--

00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:26.460 align:middle line:90%
many picture it as dark.

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Instead we mean returning
to where they came from.

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:31.800 align:middle line:84%
So this is why many
people's memories start

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.870 align:middle line:84%
to become far more
lucid, and they

00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:38.370 align:middle line:84%
start to have visions or
dreams of conscious experiences

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:41.550 align:middle line:84%
that they will often describe
where they are beginning

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:43.490 align:middle line:90%
to leave the body again.

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:46.380 align:middle line:84%
So we may compare
it to going back

00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:49.620 align:middle line:84%
to that phase of
the pregnancy where

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:51.660 align:middle line:84%
the soul is entering
the body more definitely

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.890 align:middle line:84%
at the seven to
nine month period,

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:56.460 align:middle line:84%
meaning you are
beginning to pop out

00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.330 align:middle line:90%
of your body toward the end.

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So there is both a
resolution of energies

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:03.960 align:middle line:84%
that you have
experienced in your life

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.370 align:middle line:90%
that you did not get to resolve.

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:08.110 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you were
a high conflict person,

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:10.320 align:middle line:84%
you will find ways to
process through conflict

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.420 align:middle line:84%
in those final days,
weeks, and months

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:13.740 align:middle line:90%
to the best of your ability.

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone will
clear it, but you

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:19.540 align:middle line:84%
will start to find a
release from those energies,

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:22.320 align:middle line:84%
but also a great
deal of love can

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:25.860 align:middle line:84%
start to fill you, for
the struggle for survival

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:28.520 align:middle line:84%
and the fear template
starts to leave you,

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:33.090 align:middle line:84%
for you are aware that there is
no further destination that you

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:36.690 align:middle line:84%
have to hold onto that
suit of armor for.

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And the experience of death
as people write about it--

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:43.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing another interview
a little later on on all

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:48.660 align:middle line:84%
of the cultures' perceptions of
what happens in the afterlife.

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Is that experience
for the entity

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:54.840 align:middle line:84%
very dependent upon their
culture and the held belief

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.700 align:middle line:90%
systems?

00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It is, and it isn't.

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:03.630 align:middle line:84%
What we would say here is that
there is not a universal entry

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:05.130 align:middle line:90%
to life and leaving of life.

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So as you are saying, it is
somewhat different from soul

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:11.520 align:middle line:84%
to soul, but what we
would say mostly here

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.160 align:middle line:84%
is that much of this
is the best ability

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:17.430 align:middle line:84%
that we can describe this
from your human perception--

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:19.380 align:middle line:84%
not that your human
perception is less than.

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:21.980 align:middle line:84%
It is just very fixed
and very formed--

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:25.620 align:middle line:84%
that return into energy
in its purest form

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:29.400 align:middle line:84%
takes place for different people
in different human timelines.

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:32.040 align:middle line:84%
So for most, it
will be a 6 to 12

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.440 align:middle line:84%
month period before
they have fully

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:37.680 align:middle line:84%
exited this plane, which
is why for some people

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.260 align:middle line:84%
they do not feel the
presence of their loved ones

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:42.360 align:middle line:84%
after the first week
or so of departure

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.630 align:middle line:90%
for sometimes up to a year.

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is because those
loved ones have not yet

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.620 align:middle line:84%
taken their new place,
but they are instead

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:52.440 align:middle line:84%
processing through
what they experienced

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:55.590 align:middle line:84%
and returning to the
purer energy form.

00:47:55.590 --> 00:47:57.480 align:middle line:84%
What we will say is
this place leaves

00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.280 align:middle line:90%
an imprint on the energy.

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:01.350 align:middle line:84%
Just as you as human
beings can pick up

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:06.180 align:middle line:84%
on illnesses and all sorts of
other emotional dense energies

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:10.140 align:middle line:84%
from one another, so, too,
do you have to clear yourself

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:13.590 align:middle line:84%
once you leave this planet
of the experience of that

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:16.110 align:middle line:84%
in the energy field, for
essentially the energy

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:18.840 align:middle line:84%
field has to squeeze
into a far smaller suit

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:22.180 align:middle line:84%
than it does when it releases
back into consciousness.

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:24.750 align:middle line:84%
So the experience is
somewhat different

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:27.870 align:middle line:84%
depending on the perspective
of the individual and the life,

00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:30.870 align:middle line:84%
but for most it is a 6 to 12
month processing and review

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:34.710 align:middle line:84%
period before being
returned to a new decision

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:36.510 align:middle line:90%
point as to what is next.

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And very few, particularly
at this time on Earth,

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:41.610 align:middle line:84%
are choosing to
reincarnate very quickly.

00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:43.740 align:middle line:84%
There was a period where
that was more common,

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:45.300 align:middle line:84%
but at this time
on Earth, things

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:48.840 align:middle line:84%
are heating up as such that you
have a lot more warriors down

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:52.030 align:middle line:84%
here right now doing a lot
more of the heavy lifting.

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:54.585 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, people are not
jumping back in so quickly.

00:48:54.585 --> 00:48:57.510 align:middle line:90%


00:48:57.510 --> 00:49:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then the very,
very first hours and few days

00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:03.160 align:middle line:90%
of a person departing the body--

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.970 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes that's when
people feel them the closest,

00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:09.180 align:middle line:84%
as though they haven't even
begun the process of transition

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:10.380 align:middle line:90%
fully yet.

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:11.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's a good time to--

00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:13.740 align:middle line:84%
I find a good time to
communicate with them

00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:15.323 align:middle line:84%
if there are earthly
affairs that need

00:49:15.323 --> 00:49:16.780 align:middle line:90%
to be settled, for example.

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about that
phenomenon of right

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:19.600 align:middle line:90%
after death?

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: If we were to give you
a physicalized example of it,

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:26.990 align:middle line:84%
you might imagine that
the energy of the body--

00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:29.650 align:middle line:84%
the person who has left
the body is perhaps

00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:32.440 align:middle line:84%
around six feet away from
that body for usually

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:36.040 align:middle line:90%
the first 24 to 72 hours or so.

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:39.232 align:middle line:84%
So they do not exactly leave
the field of existence,

00:49:39.232 --> 00:49:41.440 align:middle line:84%
but it is not either that
they are seeing or watching

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:42.690 align:middle line:90%
all of the time.

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:44.770 align:middle line:84%
They are already
in what some of you

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:46.660 align:middle line:84%
refer to as the
other world, meaning

00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:49.570 align:middle line:84%
the world of the unseen,
but they have moments

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:52.480 align:middle line:84%
that they can see what is
going on, for many of you

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:56.200 align:middle line:84%
get deeply attached to each
other on the human plane,

00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:57.730 align:middle line:84%
and therefore there
is an agreement

00:49:57.730 --> 00:50:00.730 align:middle line:84%
that, when the loss is incurred
of someone that you deeply

00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:04.150 align:middle line:84%
love, there can be a
connective tissue, if you like,

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:08.960 align:middle line:84%
energetically that will continue
to exist for a short period,

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:11.350 align:middle line:84%
especially if the
transition has been sudden.

00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:13.840 align:middle line:84%
That is very important
when the transition has

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:17.200 align:middle line:84%
been sudden, but
then quite quickly

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:21.550 align:middle line:84%
by the end of a few days
or even a week the person

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:24.400 align:middle line:84%
will leave that
field of existence

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:27.010 align:middle line:90%
very, very propulsively.

00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:31.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to look at it
in terms of your physical eyes,

00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:32.740 align:middle line:84%
it would be that
they are around six

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:35.464 align:middle line:84%
feet from the body for that
first few days or week,

00:50:35.464 --> 00:50:36.880 align:middle line:84%
and then all of a
sudden at around

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.680 align:middle line:84%
the time they are
ready to go they

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:42.250 align:middle line:84%
will go 1,000 feet up into
the air in terms of how

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:43.810 align:middle line:90%
you would view it spatially.

00:50:43.810 --> 00:50:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Does not mean they
cannot still connect.

00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:48.659 align:middle line:84%
This is where more third
eye and psychic connection

00:50:48.659 --> 00:50:50.200 align:middle line:84%
will take place,
and of course, there

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:53.710 align:middle line:84%
are those who can spectrally
pop back down, meaning

00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:56.350 align:middle line:84%
they can project holographic
images of themselves

00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:58.210 align:middle line:84%
back down onto the
earth at key times

00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:00.700 align:middle line:84%
if they need to do that
to communicate visually

00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:04.450 align:middle line:84%
as well as energetically with
their loved ones or others who

00:51:04.450 --> 00:51:08.470 align:middle line:84%
they can be of use to to help
them see beyond the veil,

00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:12.220 align:middle line:84%
but most do not tend to hang
around on the Earth plane.

00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:14.740 align:middle line:84%
There are a small
percentage who do,

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:16.780 align:middle line:84%
but often this is
because they have-- for

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:19.550 align:middle line:84%
want of a better
term-- lost their way.

00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:21.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, very interesting.

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And the whole phenomenon
of people saying,

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:27.700 align:middle line:84%
well, I saw my mother, my
father-- everybody was there

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.740 align:middle line:84%
when I passed to the
other side in near death

00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:33.240 align:middle line:84%
experiences-- near death,
not full death experiences.

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Are they actually--
are they seeing

00:51:34.930 --> 00:51:37.120 align:middle line:84%
one of these holographic
projections made

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:38.620 align:middle line:90%
for their comfort?

00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Or if the being has departed and
oftentimes even reincarnated,

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.520 align:middle line:84%
what actually are
they experiencing

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.720 align:middle line:90%
when they see this?

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We would say
that it is holographic,

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:50.774 align:middle line:84%
but so, too, is this
world that you live on.

00:51:50.774 --> 00:51:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:51:51.690 --> 00:51:54.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: So in some ways, yes.

00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:56.800 align:middle line:84%
The answer to your
question is yes, yes,

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.590 align:middle line:90%
and yes to all of the above.

00:51:58.590 --> 00:52:00.610 align:middle line:90%
And we would just add one thing.

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:03.580 align:middle line:84%
The comfort that many of you
derived from your connections

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:07.870 align:middle line:84%
to each other is because of
the importance of the purpose

00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:09.970 align:middle line:84%
you each have in
each other's lives.

00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:11.632 align:middle line:84%
So therefore that
sense of comfort

00:52:11.632 --> 00:52:13.840 align:middle line:84%
when you are seeing a
holographic image of your loved

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:18.550 align:middle line:84%
ones is you might experience
it as a divine moment

00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:21.250 align:middle line:84%
with the universe, where
everything reconnects you

00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:25.030 align:middle line:84%
to the truth of everything's
connection to everything.

00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and how does
the stage work where we begin

00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:33.760 align:middle line:84%
dropping away the personality
characteristics of a given

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:37.780 align:middle line:84%
incarnation going back
into this process of--

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:40.630 align:middle line:84%
even into the process of review
and then weighing whether

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:42.940 align:middle line:84%
or not to incarnate
at a given time?

00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Where do we start dropping
away those features

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:47.140 align:middle line:90%
of our previous incarnation?

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: We would say that
actually the personality is

00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:53.526 align:middle line:84%
far more imprinted by the actual
human body and the collective

00:52:53.526 --> 00:52:55.150 align:middle line:84%
that you are born
into it at that time.

00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:57.460 align:middle line:84%
So while there may be
some soul similarities

00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:59.600 align:middle line:84%
between incarnations--
for example,

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:00.820 align:middle line:90%
you may be high in strength.

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:02.580 align:middle line:90%
You may be high in leadership.

00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:06.160 align:middle line:84%
The personality that is
formed around those energies

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:09.010 align:middle line:84%
will be quite different
each time because each time

00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:11.590 align:middle line:84%
you are highly influenced
by, first of all,

00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:13.630 align:middle line:84%
the family of origin
and the genetic line,

00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:15.930 align:middle line:84%
and second of all, the
time that you are born into

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and the collective culture
that you were born into.

00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:21.910 align:middle line:84%
And that is what decides
so much of the personality

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:24.580 align:middle line:84%
aspect, which is why
when so many of you

00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:26.620 align:middle line:84%
have your soul journeys,
your meditations,

00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:29.080 align:middle line:84%
your expansive
experiences, there is not

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:31.000 align:middle line:84%
much personality
there, and that is what

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.010 align:middle line:90%
makes it feel so good to you.

00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And yet the truth
is, of course, you

00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:37.090 align:middle line:84%
derive so much joy from
your personalities,

00:53:37.090 --> 00:53:40.120 align:middle line:84%
for your personalities
are like maps to you.

00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:43.330 align:middle line:84%
If you weren't taking a
left turn or a right turn

00:53:43.330 --> 00:53:45.179 align:middle line:84%
via those
personalities of yours,

00:53:45.179 --> 00:53:46.720 align:middle line:84%
you would not get
at the destinations

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.261 align:middle line:84%
of the people or
the pathway that you

00:53:48.261 --> 00:53:50.630 align:middle line:90%
are supposed to be meeting.

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's move to the
process of life review

00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:57.460 align:middle line:90%
that's always spoken of.

00:53:57.460 --> 00:53:59.060 align:middle line:84%
What is that process
actually like?

00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:00.740 align:middle line:90%
How does that take place?

00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, it is far
more formed these days

00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:04.330 align:middle line:90%
than it used to be.

00:54:04.330 --> 00:54:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Again, we will say that
the human incarnation wheel

00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:09.640 align:middle line:90%
is a very different point.

00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:11.830 align:middle line:84%
If you were to go
back 100 or 200 years,

00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:13.674 align:middle line:84%
there was a certain
agenda on the planet

00:54:13.674 --> 00:54:15.090 align:middle line:84%
that everyone was
driving towards.

00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:18.060 align:middle line:84%
So even though your
population has grown larger,

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:21.390 align:middle line:84%
there was even more of a
jumping in at that point,

00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:24.540 align:middle line:84%
and it was even more
desired than it is now.

00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:28.770 align:middle line:84%
We say that to be clear that
the review process is changing

00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:30.180 align:middle line:90%
as the Earth is changing.

00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:33.390 align:middle line:84%
It used to be that the review
process would decide upon what

00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:35.850 align:middle line:84%
was best for the
collective first,

00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:39.270 align:middle line:84%
meaning the individualized
idea of your birth,

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:42.180 align:middle line:84%
your life path is
actually one that

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:46.920 align:middle line:84%
is not as true as the collective
purpose that any of you

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.190 align:middle line:90%
hold today.

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So it would be decided
that you would review

00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:53.820 align:middle line:84%
what you had experienced before,
and if there was balancing

00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:55.810 align:middle line:84%
that you needed to
bring-- so for example,

00:54:55.810 --> 00:54:59.280 align:middle line:84%
if you had been a warlord, and
you were capable of going back

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.460 align:middle line:84%
to the planet, and because
of what you had cleared

00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:04.471 align:middle line:84%
from that life, and
understood from that life,

00:55:04.471 --> 00:55:06.720 align:middle line:84%
and were ready to bring, you
would come back and bring

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:09.630 align:middle line:84%
the balance of
compassion, or generosity,

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:11.000 align:middle line:90%
and be life bringing.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Again, we must caution here
that from our perspective

00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:17.700 align:middle line:90%
all of this is as it should be.

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:20.700 align:middle line:84%
So often in the human
mind the idea of a warlord

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:22.890 align:middle line:84%
is something to be
feared and judged,

00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:26.730 align:middle line:84%
and yet from our perspective,
that is the game of humanity

00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:28.620 align:middle line:84%
that you have been
playing for so long.

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And so we do not judge the
players on the game board

00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:32.710 align:middle line:90%
from our perspective.

00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:36.690 align:middle line:84%
We simply observe it,
and we see can it evolve?

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So that review process can,
first of all, bring you

00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:42.090 align:middle line:84%
to a point of, do I need
to go back and balance?

00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:44.370 align:middle line:90%
Can I go back and balance?

00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, in the
last 50, 60, 70 years

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:51.240 align:middle line:84%
there has been far more of a
wave of what you would call

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:53.580 align:middle line:84%
lightworkers jumping
onto the planet--

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:56.940 align:middle line:84%
higher frequency beings who
have either not re-incarnated

00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:58.710 align:middle line:84%
for quite some time
or have not had

00:55:58.710 --> 00:56:01.920 align:middle line:84%
many incarnations on this
Earth and have come back

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:05.370 align:middle line:84%
with an even stronger
hardwiring to remember

00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:08.610 align:middle line:84%
source energy, which is what
made your early lives quite

00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:11.496 align:middle line:84%
painful for many of
you, for that dissonance

00:56:11.496 --> 00:56:12.870 align:middle line:84%
between the world
you were seeing

00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:14.411 align:middle line:84%
and the world you
were feeling inside

00:56:14.411 --> 00:56:17.430 align:middle line:84%
was even stronger, meaning
you came in with a higher

00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:20.220 align:middle line:84%
remembering of the
frequencies and energies that

00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:23.730 align:middle line:84%
are true to you because you were
here to embody and bring them.

00:56:23.730 --> 00:56:25.350 align:middle line:84%
So you could not
forget them as much

00:56:25.350 --> 00:56:28.200 align:middle line:84%
as you may have done in
previous reincarnations.

00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.150 align:middle line:84%
So the review
process at this point

00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:34.020 align:middle line:84%
has become a lot more
identity-less and a lot more

00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:39.120 align:middle line:84%
personality based, meaning
there are less agendas going

00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:41.760 align:middle line:84%
on in terms of this
planet right now

00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:46.920 align:middle line:84%
other than the raising of
consciousness, which is, shall

00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:49.920 align:middle line:84%
we say, struggling to
push through so much

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:52.410 align:middle line:84%
of the control, and
elements, and energies

00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:55.570 align:middle line:84%
that are on this planet that
do not want the consciousness

00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:56.370 align:middle line:90%
to grow.

00:56:56.370 --> 00:56:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And that is the beauty
of the dance here.

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's more,
as you say, ordered

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:07.110 align:middle line:84%
toward your individual expansion
at this time rather than group

00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:08.160 align:middle line:90%
expansion.

00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:10.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Much of the karmic
wheel that many of you

00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:13.890 align:middle line:84%
know of for many
lifetimes is beginning

00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:15.690 align:middle line:84%
to come to a close
on the planet,

00:57:15.690 --> 00:57:19.500 align:middle line:84%
for it has gone from a less
personal focus on the Earth

00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:21.150 align:middle line:90%
to a far more planetary focus.

00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:22.740 align:middle line:84%
That is the time
you are coming into.

00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:27.017 align:middle line:84%
So you will see more etheric
incarnations at this time.

00:57:27.017 --> 00:57:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just a quick question.

00:57:28.350 --> 00:57:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Generally speaking--
and I know it's

00:57:29.850 --> 00:57:31.980 align:middle line:84%
highly individual--
how long do entities

00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:33.960 align:middle line:90%
wait between incarnations?

00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It really
depends on the individual,

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:40.440 align:middle line:84%
but for most, it can be a
long time in human years.

00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:44.670 align:middle line:84%
It can be somewhat between
10 and 100 years for most.

00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:47.560 align:middle line:84%
For some, it can be
many, many centuries,

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:49.440 align:middle line:84%
and there have
been some instances

00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:52.320 align:middle line:84%
where people have come
almost straight back in,

00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:54.810 align:middle line:84%
but that was often predestined
before that lifetime,

00:57:54.810 --> 00:58:00.330 align:middle line:84%
meaning a person will know who
they are in a certain life,

00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and then that life will end,
and they will know as a soul

00:58:02.850 --> 00:58:04.950 align:middle line:84%
that they are to go
straight back in,

00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:06.390 align:middle line:90%
for the two lives were linked.

00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:10.260 align:middle line:84%
You see this a lot with
important figures in your life,

00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:14.160 align:middle line:84%
meaning someone who has
a visible importance

00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:17.340 align:middle line:84%
or an effective importance
to a large group

00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:20.850 align:middle line:84%
will often have reincarnated
quite quickly, for usually

00:58:20.850 --> 00:58:22.710 align:middle line:84%
the life before that
they were working up

00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:25.092 align:middle line:90%
to that energy field.

00:58:25.092 --> 00:58:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And at
what point-- we're

00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:30.420 align:middle line:84%
coming toward the end of our
time now-- and at what point

00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:34.660 align:middle line:84%
does the reincarnation process
cease for an individual,

00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:37.590 align:middle line:84%
and what point is
it time to move

00:58:37.590 --> 00:58:40.140 align:middle line:84%
on to a different
type of experience?

00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The reincarnation
process of humanity ceases once

00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:47.130 align:middle line:90%
there is a certain level of--

00:58:47.130 --> 00:58:49.750 align:middle line:84%
shall we say, the karmic
wheel has been cleared.

00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:53.220 align:middle line:84%
So there are some who are
stuck in cycles of going round

00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:54.570 align:middle line:90%
and around the human wheel.

00:58:54.570 --> 00:58:58.470 align:middle line:84%
There are others-- many of you
who are listening to this--

00:58:58.470 --> 00:59:00.780 align:middle line:84%
who are not limited
to the Earth plane

00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:04.140 align:middle line:84%
and are instead incarnating
in different forms

00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:05.490 align:middle line:90%
in different places.

00:59:05.490 --> 00:59:09.780 align:middle line:84%
For many of you, though, who are
listening and the reincarnation

00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:13.200 align:middle line:84%
is far more spread,
that is usually

00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:16.690 align:middle line:84%
choice based, meaning there is
a perception that many of you

00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:18.790 align:middle line:84%
are stuck in the
reincarnation wheel,

00:59:18.790 --> 00:59:21.610 align:middle line:84%
and while for some that
is or has been true,

00:59:21.610 --> 00:59:24.280 align:middle line:84%
that is no longer
so much the case.

00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:26.240 align:middle line:84%
That has been true
for the last 30,

00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:29.110 align:middle line:84%
40 years certainly that
many who are leaving now

00:59:29.110 --> 00:59:32.170 align:middle line:84%
are not choosing to
reincarnate certainly to Earth,

00:59:32.170 --> 00:59:34.870 align:middle line:84%
but instead are in
an experience where

00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:38.200 align:middle line:84%
they get to reset their
intention as to whether or not

00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:43.000 align:middle line:84%
retaking form is necessary for
them, but also for the planet.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.370 align:middle line:84%
As we said, the implosion
that is taking place right

00:59:45.370 --> 00:59:48.670 align:middle line:84%
now is redefining the future
of humanity for the next 1000

00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:51.460 align:middle line:84%
to 2000 years,
and that in itself

00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:54.190 align:middle line:84%
will have a huge impact
on whether or not

00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:58.150 align:middle line:84%
people are being as
effective in the human body

00:59:58.150 --> 01:00:02.140 align:middle line:84%
at raising consciousness
as they were.

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any final thoughts
before we close this topic

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:06.831 align:middle line:90%
and bring Lee back?

01:00:06.831 --> 01:00:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It has been a
pleasure to be with you.

01:00:08.830 --> 01:00:12.730 align:middle line:84%
We will say that this is a
complex topic, for it depends

01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:16.090 align:middle line:84%
on the individual, but we
have enjoyed the experience

01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:19.480 align:middle line:84%
of being able to bring some
of our perspective views

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:23.990 align:middle line:84%
and language to it, and we
thank you for raising the topic.

01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:26.108 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you very
much until next time.

01:00:26.108 --> 01:00:34.582 align:middle line:90%


01:00:34.582 --> 01:00:35.540 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing, Lee?

01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:37.042 align:middle line:84%
Did you learn a
new thing or two?

01:00:37.042 --> 01:00:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I heard
some stuff, but I

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.525 align:middle line:84%
will have to go back
because a lot of it

01:00:40.525 --> 01:00:41.980 align:middle line:90%
was a bit over my head.

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'll
have to watch it.

01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because
this isn't a topic

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:47.200 align:middle line:84%
that you've had to delve
into before with the Zs.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, not so much.

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:50.410 align:middle line:84%
It's come up very
personally-- so

01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:53.199 align:middle line:84%
with people personally, but not
as a kind of a concept field.

01:00:53.199 --> 01:00:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think it's
good at this point in time

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:57.070 align:middle line:84%
when there's so much
confusion to really look

01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:57.910 align:middle line:90%
at the big picture.

01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:58.785 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Definitely.

01:00:58.785 --> 01:01:01.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If we chose to be
here at this time together,

01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:04.434 align:middle line:84%
we need to acknowledge that,
own it, and then maybe look

01:01:04.434 --> 01:01:06.100 align:middle line:84%
at what that process
is all about, which

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:07.420 align:middle line:90%
is what motivated it.

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And the first part of the
conversation with the Zs,

01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:12.380 align:middle line:84%
too, which was tangential, I
thought was just beautiful.

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Great.

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:14.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I look
forward to your

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.304 align:middle line:84%
being able to see
the interview, so you

01:01:16.304 --> 01:01:17.388 align:middle line:90%
can see what came through.

01:01:17.388 --> 01:01:18.187 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

01:01:18.187 --> 01:01:19.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes.

01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any final
thoughts for you,

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:22.379 align:middle line:84%
and what's going on with
you, and new directions

01:01:22.379 --> 01:01:23.890 align:middle line:90%
you're taking?

01:01:23.890 --> 01:01:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: No, I think the one
thing that's come up for me--

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:30.130 align:middle line:84%
a big theme in my work in the
last couple of years-- and I

01:01:30.130 --> 01:01:32.170 align:middle line:84%
think that's really going
on for a lot of people

01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:34.470 align:middle line:84%
is watching so many
more lightworkers step

01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:37.274 align:middle line:84%
into the fray, whether they're
a yoga teacher, whether they

01:01:37.274 --> 01:01:39.440 align:middle line:84%
are healer-- it doesn't
really matter what the form.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.540 align:middle line:84%
&Gt;>REGINA: Whether
they're a kindergartner.

01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Exactly.

01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:44.715 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's really where
my own personal work is going

01:01:44.715 --> 01:01:46.840 align:middle line:84%
at the moment-- kind of
helping people who are here

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:49.420 align:middle line:84%
to bring transformation,
whether they're doing that

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:52.047 align:middle line:84%
very directly in a
form of a job that

01:01:52.047 --> 01:01:54.130 align:middle line:84%
might look like transformation,
or whether they're

01:01:54.130 --> 01:01:58.150 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand their
own impact on somebody.

01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To embolden
them, empower them,

01:01:59.890 --> 01:02:02.500 align:middle line:84%
encourage them to step forward
and do what they're here to do.

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Absolutely.

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:04.000 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.310 align:middle line:10%
And that's a passion
for me because that's

01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:07.010 align:middle line:10%
something I've been
doing for 13 years,

01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:09.460 align:middle line:10%
so working with people
who want to do that

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:11.202 align:middle line:10%
and helping them
stabilize or direct

01:02:11.202 --> 01:02:13.660 align:middle line:10%
where they're going-- that's
something I really love doing.

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:16.201 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some people just
need the validation of someone

01:02:16.201 --> 01:02:17.830 align:middle line:84%
they look up to such
as yourself to be

01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:20.680 align:middle line:84%
able to launch on that path
instead of asking, well, who am

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:22.360 align:middle line:90%
I to think I can heal people?

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.365 align:middle line:84%
When they have healing
hands right there.

01:02:24.365 --> 01:02:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And we're all here,
exactly as you were saying.

01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:29.349 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I think we
all can go through that,

01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:31.390 align:middle line:84%
so I really love supporting
that stepping forward

01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:33.200 align:middle line:84%
process because I
know I needed that.

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, well, as always, an
absolute pleasure, and so we'll

01:02:37.450 --> 01:02:40.310 align:middle line:84%
do this again on this little
time wheel and karmic wheel

01:02:40.310 --> 01:02:41.110 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

01:02:41.110 --> 01:02:41.770 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Great.

01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:43.510 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So until next
time, thank you so much.

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:44.030 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: Thank you, Regina.

01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:45.130 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It's a
pleasure as always.

01:02:45.130 --> 01:02:45.979 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: Thanks.

01:02:45.979 --> 01:02:48.520 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I hope this has been
as enlightening a conversation

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.050 align:middle line:10%
for you as it has for me.

01:02:50.050 --> 01:02:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Lee is constantly bringing
through wisdoms from the Zs

01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:55.780 align:middle line:84%
and has attained great learning
of his own in the process.

01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:57.640 align:middle line:84%
