>> REGINA MEREDITH: Christopher
Bledsoe is perhaps the most

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.960 align:middle line:10%
researched extraterrestrial
contactee in the world.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.930 align:middle line:10%
From a terrifying
first experience

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.010 align:middle line:10%
that affected his entire family,
to having the ability to call

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:10%
in orbs for the
alphabet soup agencies,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.570 align:middle line:10%
his journey is truly
an extraordinary one.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And I've interviewed you
before on a Zoom platform,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.070 align:middle line:84%
but I have never seen
you in the flesh.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.865 align:middle line:84%
And it's so good to meet
you and feel your energy.

00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:44.907 align:middle line:84%
>> CHRIS BLEDSOE: Well,
it's my honor to be here.

00:00:44.907 --> 00:00:47.762 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I didn't get
sparks off of you, just love,

00:00:47.762 --> 00:00:49.970 align:middle line:84%
although there's some crazy
stuff happening with some

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:50.850 align:middle line:90%
of the electronics.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.050 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, we're
going to have a lot

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.810 align:middle line:90%
to squeeze in in 45 minutes.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.510 align:middle line:84%
But we have to start with
where you started in life.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.047 align:middle line:84%
And you're truly just such a
loving and humble human being.

00:01:04.047 --> 00:01:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And I know everybody
feels this in you

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.960 align:middle line:90%
and reflects it back to you.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.010 align:middle line:90%
But it's true.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.650 align:middle line:84%
So you were living a
life, working hard.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.000 align:middle line:90%
You were in construction.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.100 align:middle line:84%
You went to church,
a Pentecostal church,

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.940 align:middle line:90%
with your wife.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.890 align:middle line:84%
You had some tough
things along the way.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.720 align:middle line:84%
You were shot and had
to recover from that.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.715 align:middle line:90%
Was it hunting season?

00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Hunting accident.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.207 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
hunting accident.

00:01:24.207 --> 00:01:27.650 align:middle line:10%
And then you lost your very
young wife of only 11 months

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.280 align:middle line:10%
and came across her in
such a startling way.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.460 align:middle line:84%
If you just want to
share that little bit.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.033 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: About
the-- losing her?

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, about what
happened that night because it

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.470 align:middle line:84%
was such a tender
story in the book.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.850 align:middle line:10%
>> BLEDSOE: Well, it happened to
be I grew up with a father that

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.110 align:middle line:10%
hunted and loved to hunt.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.080 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.470 align:middle line:90%
It was a Saturday.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.590 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to go out of
town to go deer hunting.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.700 align:middle line:90%
So we went out of town.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.700 align:middle line:10%
And we had planned a party.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.250 align:middle line:84%
My best friend had
a party going on.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.660 align:middle line:90%
And everybody was going to it.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was anxious to get home
from two hours out of town.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.350 align:middle line:90%
But I ran late.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.410 align:middle line:84%
I got home late, about
8 o'clock at night.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.878 align:middle line:84%
And my wife had already
left for the party.

00:02:11.878 --> 00:02:13.420 align:middle line:84%
I just told her,
I'll meet you there.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.300 align:middle line:90%


00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, long story
short, on my ride--

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.975 align:middle line:84%
and I write about
this in the book.

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:26.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm approaching this party
as a dead man's curve,

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.340 align:middle line:84%
that a power line that crosses--
a big, high-tension power line

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.340 align:middle line:84%
crosses right dead
center of this curve.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.265 align:middle line:84%
We should come back later in my
life, actually during the event.

00:02:39.265 --> 00:02:40.460 align:middle line:90%
It appeared that night.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.080 align:middle line:84%
But when I started through
that curve going to the party,

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.830 align:middle line:90%
I saw a car laying on its side.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.010 align:middle line:90%
And I stopped.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.500 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea whose car it was.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And it had rolled side and over
and up into these people's yard.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And the weird thing was
the motor was still running

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.050 align:middle line:84%
and the tires were still turning
when I stopped and jumped out

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.920 align:middle line:90%
of the car.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the people
inside open the door

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.740 align:middle line:90%
and stick their head out.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.610 align:middle line:84%
I said, have you seen
who was driving this car?

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.820 align:middle line:90%
They may have been hurt.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.480 align:middle line:90%
They might call 911.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And on my walk
back to the road is

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.240 align:middle line:84%
where I found her and had
no clue it was who it was.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That was your wife.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.115 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah,
she died right there.

00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And there was some
healing that had to take place

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.150 align:middle line:90%
after all of that.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.060 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Well,
all these years,

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.666 align:middle line:84%
I never could get past
the trauma from it.

00:03:32.666 --> 00:03:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's huge.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.480 align:middle line:84%
You'd only been
married 11 months.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.960 align:middle line:84%
But these things
happened in your life.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And you were challenged
in a lot of ways.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.260 align:middle line:90%
You were challenged financially.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.030 align:middle line:84%
This caused physical
problems, your body's response

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.200 align:middle line:84%
to all these pressures
and challenges.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%
So you were just a young
man trying to get by,

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:84%
doing the best he could,
showing up for church on Sunday.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah, every Sunday.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:57.750 align:middle line:90%
And you remarried.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And you had children,
another family--

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.410 align:middle line:90%
a family.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And now I think we should
move right to the night,

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.590 align:middle line:84%
because there's so much
after that that happens.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.140 align:middle line:90%
So let's just set up the night.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.072 align:middle line:84%
And we'll try to do
it as briefly as we

00:04:12.072 --> 00:04:13.280 align:middle line:90%
can without cheating anybody.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.080 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: OK.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.660 align:middle line:84%
We're going to fast forward
to 2007, January the 8th.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.375 align:middle line:84%
I had just sold my
company two years before.

00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:26.760 align:middle line:84%
We had a collapse in
the building market.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.612 align:middle line:90%
And things were tough.

00:04:28.612 --> 00:04:30.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, 2008
was a tough time.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: And I was suffering
with Crohn's disease to the max.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.930 align:middle line:84%
I started back to work
dealing with Crohn's.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.180 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to work with--

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.486 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, pain.

00:04:40.486 --> 00:04:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: And so
long story short,

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.620 align:middle line:84%
I found myself taking my son
and three other guys fishing

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.940 align:middle line:84%
on what's called
the Cape Fear River,

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.430 align:middle line:84%
a small river south of
Fayetteville, North Carolina.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.970 align:middle line:90%
And I was an inefficient--

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.870 align:middle line:90%
I was into seeking guidance.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.790 align:middle line:84%
I was actually
praying, Lord help me.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:04.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm sick.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm struggling
to feed my kids.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.355 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:05:08.355 --> 00:05:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And I walked away from the
group and walked up the road.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And there were these
big balls of fire

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.223 align:middle line:84%
in the broad daylight about
300 yards from me and--

00:05:18.223 --> 00:05:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You thought,
was there another sun?

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.855 align:middle line:90%
And what's happening?

00:05:20.855 --> 00:05:22.647 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: It looked
like the setting sun,

00:05:22.647 --> 00:05:24.005 align:middle line:90%
the first one I saw.

00:05:24.005 --> 00:05:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Then when the second one--
when I got eyes on it,

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.020 align:middle line:84%
I knew that this
was something that

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.740 align:middle line:90%
wasn't supposed to be there.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And long story short,
I come walking back

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.045 align:middle line:84%
to the campfire
on the riverbank.

00:05:39.045 --> 00:05:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And I thought 20
minutes had passed.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And the group was
furious with me.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.140 align:middle line:84%
They'd been looking
for me all night.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And actually, four
hours had gone by.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.567 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then what
about your son that night?

00:05:52.567 --> 00:05:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Because he thought
you had abandoned--

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.700 align:middle line:90%
this was very traumatic for him.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.300 align:middle line:84%
He said he felt paralyzed
and that you had-- he felt

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.440 align:middle line:90%
he'd been abandoned by you.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.148 align:middle line:84%
And you said, what
are you talking about?

00:06:02.148 --> 00:06:03.710 align:middle line:90%
I've only been gone minutes.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And weren't there some
beings at that time

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:07.908 align:middle line:90%
also with the red eyes?

00:06:07.908 --> 00:06:08.708 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:06:08.708 --> 00:06:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk about
them, how they played into this.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: So I'd gone imagine
about a half a mile-long dirt

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.900 align:middle line:84%
road that winds down
to a cul-de-sac,

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.600 align:middle line:84%
dead ends into a grassy
cul-de-sac about an acre.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And earlier that
day, I had walked

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.370 align:middle line:84%
in the back of the cul-de-sac
looking for wildlife.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.820 align:middle line:84%
That was the excuse I used just
to get away so I could think.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.510 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't into socializing.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And so he knew I had gone
in there earlier that day.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And two of the
guys took my truck

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.110 align:middle line:90%
when they were searching for me.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And one stayed at the
fire the whole time.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And so while two were
going with the truck,

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.360 align:middle line:84%
these little balls of red
light, what looked like--

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.880 align:middle line:84%
he thought it was a flashlight,
a military flashlight,

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.920 align:middle line:90%
because that's what--

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.320 align:middle line:90%
they use those red lens on them.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And he saw him cross the road,
looking down this road parallel

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.330 align:middle line:90%
to the river.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.260 align:middle line:84%
He saw him across
the road way down.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And he ran and told
the guys, there's

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.010 align:middle line:84%
somebody walking along
with flashlights.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And so he ran back to the
back of the cul-de-sac looking

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.050 align:middle line:90%
for me again.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And these lights came out of the
forest and came straight at him

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.050 align:middle line:90%
all the way down this road.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And when they got within
40 or 50 yards of him,

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:29.790 align:middle line:90%
he began to hide.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So he started backing himself up
under this real thick shrubbery

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.220 align:middle line:90%
that surrounds the cul-de-sac.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And when they got within
15 or 20 feet of him,

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.500 align:middle line:84%
he realized it wasn't
flashlights or orbs.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.800 align:middle line:84%
They were the eyes of
these little beings

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.230 align:middle line:90%
about three feet tall.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And they were glowing like
real soft color, like the moon.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.250 align:middle line:84%
And their eyes were
glowing, a really deep red.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And the whole time,
one was looking at him.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.150 align:middle line:90%
And he felt paralyzed.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:00.950 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't move.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:01.457 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't scream--

00:08:01.457 --> 00:08:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Couldn't
scream for you.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:03.488 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: --anything.

00:08:03.488 --> 00:08:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And when I came up to him,
they were still there.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.840 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see them until after
I got him and took him back

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.205 align:middle line:90%
to the fire.

00:08:12.205 --> 00:08:13.970 align:middle line:84%
When we left him
there in the car,

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.200 align:middle line:84%
that's when one came
out of the forest

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.678 align:middle line:84%
and started following us
up the path in the truck.

00:08:21.678 --> 00:08:24.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now, what about
the fact you were actually gone

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.100 align:middle line:90%
for a few hours?

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.112 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:08:27.112 --> 00:08:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Well, for
the first two years,

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.919 align:middle line:84%
you could have made me think or
believe that I was gone for five

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:33.985 align:middle line:90%
minutes.

00:08:33.985 --> 00:08:37.720 align:middle line:84%
It was hard to deal with
realizing and admitting

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.059 align:middle line:84%
that you have missing
time, that something

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:41.265 align:middle line:90%
happened you can't remember.

00:08:41.265 --> 00:08:43.855 align:middle line:90%


00:08:43.855 --> 00:08:49.145 align:middle line:84%
But after a regression with a
Harvard-trained physician or--

00:08:49.145 --> 00:08:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Therapist.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: --therapist, Dr.
Michael O'Connell, he told me,

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.840 align:middle line:84%
you will remember it all
but not very quickly,

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.163 align:middle line:84%
because it's just probably
too much to take at once.

00:08:59.163 --> 00:09:00.205 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Too traumatic.

00:09:00.205 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.380 align:middle line:90%
And so I started remembering.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And there's still
a lot that's gray.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:12.400 align:middle line:84%
But the overarching thing was
I was getting a virtual tour.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.380 align:middle line:84%
They took me up over
the pyramids in Egypt.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.120 align:middle line:90%
And I'm in this clear--

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.840 align:middle line:90%
it was round, whatever it was.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.985 align:middle line:90%
I guess it was an orb.

00:09:21.985 --> 00:09:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Kind
of like a bubble?

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah, like a bubble.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: See through?

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking down at
the pyramids the whole time

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:84%
and looking over the
back of the sphinx.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I got this
message about a future event

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.570 align:middle line:90%
that ended up being 2026.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And that was reinforced
again at another time, too.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
get to that because I

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.730 align:middle line:84%
love that part of the
story, and I think

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.350 align:middle line:90%
everybody else is going to.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Your son obviously
was very traumatized.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:57.700 align:middle line:84%
It took him many years
to recover from this.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.470 align:middle line:84%
What about the other
men that were there?

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.090 align:middle line:90%
How did they handle all of it?

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.255 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Well, they had
a hard time with it, too.

00:10:04.255 --> 00:10:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
didn't have missing time.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.270 align:middle line:84%
But what they did
have is their children

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.380 align:middle line:90%
went to school with my children.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
about the same ages.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And the community, when I
reported this, we all did.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.990 align:middle line:90%
They did, too.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was clearly
the worst thing

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:28.380 align:middle line:84%
we did because not only did
the locals in the community

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:32.640 align:middle line:84%
began to give us a hard
time, so did the church.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Different churches and different
people got very tough on us.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.485 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A lot of
people say, well,

00:10:39.485 --> 00:10:41.110 align:middle line:84%
how come we don't
know more about this?

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:45.005 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it's because they
treat people like you terribly.

00:10:45.005 --> 00:10:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And you were treated
terribly because this

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.410 align:middle line:90%
is a fundamentalist church.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.058 align:middle line:84%
And this had to be the
workings of the devil.

00:10:52.058 --> 00:10:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: That's what
they thought, yeah.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you even were
asked to speak, I remember.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.540 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm out of a
sequence on the timeline.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.140 align:middle line:84%
But you were asked
to speak at a church.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.185 align:middle line:90%
And the moderator, Pastor--

00:11:04.185 --> 00:11:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Bible college.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Bible college.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So they're jumping
up and saying,

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:10.660 align:middle line:90%
this is the work of the devil.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And the people attending are
like, would you let him talk.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
horrible for you.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.980 align:middle line:84%
But this is how you
were treated everywhere.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.410 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go to the next
level because people say,

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:24.090 align:middle line:84%
well, there are these wonderful
reporting agencies like MUFON.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.360 align:middle line:84%
So finally, you decided,
well, let's just take it

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.440 align:middle line:90%
to the next level of discovery.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.150 align:middle line:90%
And you took it to MUFON.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:32.135 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:11:32.135 --> 00:11:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Well, that
was about a year later.

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:39.870 align:middle line:84%
It was actually about 14 months
before their first investigator

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.520 align:middle line:84%
showed up because I
was scared to tell it.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.640 align:middle line:84%
I just knew I'd
lose my family if I

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:50.220 align:middle line:84%
did because I was under threat
of my family being separated.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And your kids were
being ridiculed and made fun

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.146 align:middle line:90%
of at school.

00:11:53.146 --> 00:11:54.479 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Oh, worse than that.

00:11:54.479 --> 00:11:59.000 align:middle line:84%
I had somebody, don't know who,
either in the school system

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.277 align:middle line:84%
or in the church, call
social services on me--

00:12:02.277 --> 00:12:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, jeez.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: --trying
to separate me from--

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I didn't know that.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.418 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah, I didn't
write about it, but it happened.

00:12:07.418 --> 00:12:08.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, that's horrible.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah, so here I am
trying to tell the world what

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.280 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.390 align:middle line:90%
And nobody wanted to hear that.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:19.280 align:middle line:84%
When I came home, I didn't
have Crohn's disease anymore.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.450 align:middle line:84%
That blessing
happened that night.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:26.960 align:middle line:84%
But instead, it was a battle
for the next four or five years.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.490 align:middle line:90%
It was awful with everybody.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.370 align:middle line:84%
The guys with me, their
children called in at school.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:35.490 align:middle line:90%
And everybody did.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: One thing you say is
that when these very large orbs

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:42.837 align:middle line:84%
appeared and appear, there's
always a sense of calm and peace

00:12:42.837 --> 00:12:43.670 align:middle line:90%
that comes over you.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:47.130 align:middle line:84%
In spite of what was going
on otherwise, with your mind,

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.760 align:middle line:90%
the feeling was one of peace.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Yes.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And what's crazy about that is
when I walked up on him at 5--

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.680 align:middle line:84%
10 after 5-- 15 minutes
after 5-- that day,

00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.790 align:middle line:90%
it was broad daylight.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the sun was
going down in January.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.800 align:middle line:84%
But I was terrified when I
saw what I was looking at.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.038 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I rationalized--

00:13:09.038 --> 00:13:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There was
nothing to explain it.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:11.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: I mean, I'm
commercial-rated pilot.

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I was really
into aircraft recognition.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.630 align:middle line:90%
I fly models.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:20.430 align:middle line:90%
I build models.

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:21.360 align:middle line:90%
It's been my life.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And I knew what I was
looking at wasn't anything

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.060 align:middle line:90%
that the government had or--

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.850 align:middle line:90%
And so fear set in.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:33.240 align:middle line:84%
When they brought me back
that night, cured of Crohn's.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.690 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it then
till the next day,

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:41.060 align:middle line:84%
actually, over the next period
to see it didn't come back.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:44.150 align:middle line:84%
But I had lost my fear
for it that night.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And I sat there
and watched my son.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.380 align:middle line:90%
And he was in shock.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And these other three
men were terrified.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.243 align:middle line:84%
And I'm ready to get
out and look at it.

00:13:53.243 --> 00:13:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, and that-- I mean,
I think that's part

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:59.390 align:middle line:84%
of an even larger story
about you and your Dharma,

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.455 align:middle line:84%
your purpose here on
Earth at this time.

00:14:01.455 --> 00:14:03.110 align:middle line:84%
You were well
positioned for this.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:04.940 align:middle line:90%
It was time for this to happen.

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Other people got caught up in
it that weren't as ready as you.

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:11.750 align:middle line:90%
So now it's reported to MUFON.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And they're supposed
to be investigating

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:17.655 align:middle line:84%
this kind of information to
help people like yourself.

00:14:17.655 --> 00:14:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.745 align:middle line:90%
Well, I wrote about them.

00:14:21.745 --> 00:14:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And I told some of
the guys this week.

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was up in Washington
and met with some of them.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Part of the
Congressional hearings

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.760 align:middle line:90%
on the phenomena.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: And I told them.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.480 align:middle line:84%
They thought I
was mad with them.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.250 align:middle line:90%
I said, I'm not mad at you guys.

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:35.830 align:middle line:84%
I was mad at the
guys that came in

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.290 align:middle line:84%
and ruined my life
and my family's life

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.000 align:middle line:90%
17, almost 18 years ago.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.170 align:middle line:90%
17 years ago.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:44.695 align:middle line:90%


00:14:44.695 --> 00:14:46.485 align:middle line:90%
I forgive and forget, but--

00:14:46.485 --> 00:14:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But at the time,
please explain what happened.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: So I reported
it, and they came right away.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they wanted
to come the next day.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, oh, this is
a little too quick for me.

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:01.092 align:middle line:90%
I have to think about it.

00:15:01.092 --> 00:15:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I put them off
a couple of months.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.510 align:middle line:90%
And they finally came.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And they brought
the whole entourage.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:84%
They had like six investigators
from all across the country,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.600 align:middle line:84%
from Colorado, to Maryland, to
California, and everywhere else.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.488 align:middle line:84%
And they converged
from a house and--

00:15:20.488 --> 00:15:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They wanted
to see the evidence.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.550 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to see the tree
that had burn marks on it.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:26.065 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah, and the
circles on the ground.

00:15:26.065 --> 00:15:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Circles
on the ground, yeah.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.553 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: And they were
doing all their samples,

00:15:29.553 --> 00:15:36.256 align:middle line:84%
but they convinced me within 30
days of them being there to do

00:15:36.256 --> 00:15:39.910 align:middle line:84%
a little show on the
Discovery Channel.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.225 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
we'll vindicate you.

00:15:42.225 --> 00:15:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Because they knew I was having
a hard time around the community

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:46.620 align:middle line:90%
and everybody.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And so we finally
agreed-- myself

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.270 align:middle line:84%
to three other guys,
my children, my family.

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:53.190 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They
came to your home?

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: They
came to my house.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And your whole
family was involved in this?

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:59.920 align:middle line:84%
After all this ridicule,
with all this hope,

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.840 align:middle line:84%
yes, we're going to be able
to be taken seriously finally.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.320 align:middle line:90%
They were so excited.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: So what they did
was they were supposed to be

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.180 align:middle line:90%
at my house the next morning.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was all
arranged for a week.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.170 align:middle line:90%
Discovery were coming.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:16.290 align:middle line:84%
MUFON was going to meet
them there and bring them

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:90%
to the house at 8:30 to film.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.030 align:middle line:90%
And at 8:30, nobody shows.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.240 align:middle line:90%
And all my kids were up.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.040 align:middle line:90%
They were excited.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Hollywood's coming, right?

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sure.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: And I
get a phone call.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:29.860 align:middle line:90%
We're at the hotel.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Can you run by here a minute
and bring everybody, not

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.400 align:middle line:90%
your family.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.025 align:middle line:84%
Just bring the guys
that were with you,

00:16:35.025 --> 00:16:36.760 align:middle line:90%
and let's sign some paperwork.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, we'd already
signed paperwork.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Long story short, when
I walked in the hotel,

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:49.140 align:middle line:84%
they had a conference room
set up with a guy from the FBI

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.780 align:middle line:84%
there to do a lie
detector test with four

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:55.140 align:middle line:84%
or five cameras pointing
at this chair and said,

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.567 align:middle line:84%
we want you to do this before
we start doing the show.

00:16:58.567 --> 00:16:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What an ambush!

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: So they ambush me,
and then they try to basically

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.980 align:middle line:90%
make me out to look like a liar.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, I got in
a big fuss with them about it.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:12.579 align:middle line:90%
I had some creative control.

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:13.950 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get any.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:18.819 align:middle line:84%
And when it aired, it made
the situation 100 times worse.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:22.450 align:middle line:84%
So now for the next
five years, my--

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:26.380 align:middle line:84%
it took five years
at least for the--

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.290 align:middle line:84%
it was still
happening in school.

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And my little children
would go to school.

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.040 align:middle line:84%
They'd be made fun of,
your crazy father--

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And now
it's been on TV--

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah, it's on TV.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.320 align:middle line:90%
So I hated what was happening.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.560 align:middle line:84%
I blamed myself for what was
going on with my children.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.330 align:middle line:90%
I wished I'd had never told it.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:46.360 align:middle line:84%
So much happiness,
I'm not sick anymore.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.690 align:middle line:84%
But now I've got the worst
trouble because my children--

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:51.595 align:middle line:90%
I've brought this upon them.

00:17:51.595 --> 00:17:53.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And they did
not treat you nicely.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:57.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've got to say, I'm
not a fan of their programming

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.160 align:middle line:84%
because it always
does the same thing.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.110 align:middle line:90%
Takes you to the same place--

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.940 align:middle line:84%
well, this is intriguing
and this is intriguing,

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.300 align:middle line:90%
but I guess we'll never know.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.500 align:middle line:90%
Or it didn't happen.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.740 align:middle line:84%
All their shows seem to
take you to that same place

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:15.810 align:middle line:84%
of either negating it or
leaving a big question

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:19.090 align:middle line:84%
mark where there's clearly
something substantive that

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:19.890 align:middle line:90%
had happened.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't even share
their food with your family.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:84%
All the craft services
came, fed all of them

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.850 align:middle line:84%
and didn't even feed you
guys, staying at your house

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and-- oh, I was rubbed
wrong when I was reading

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:31.817 align:middle line:90%
that part of your story.

00:18:31.817 --> 00:18:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: I had to write that.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.520 align:middle line:84%
That was the worst thing
to my little children

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.670 align:middle line:90%
because they were young.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:38.260 align:middle line:90%
They were teenagers.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter was 10,
when it all happened.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, they came in with a
big crew of 15 or 20 people.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And including all the MUFON
people, they were half a dozen

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:49.320 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.720 align:middle line:84%
So my house was
completely taken over.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.130 align:middle line:90%
They moved all the furniture.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:54.317 align:middle line:90%
They set up everything.

00:18:54.317 --> 00:18:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Fed
themselves and not you.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: And
ordered our food.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:59.981 align:middle line:90%
They said, we're going to--

00:18:59.981 --> 00:19:04.490 align:middle line:84%
the line director, I guess, you
would call it that-- does that,

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:90%
came and took all our orders.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.140 align:middle line:84%
We were going to one of these
places in town and bring back--

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.680 align:middle line:84%
I won't say their name, but
it was a really well-known

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.710 align:middle line:90%
restaurant, right?

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And my kids took their time
and ordered everything.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, in about an hour they
showed back with the food.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.880 align:middle line:84%
We were all standing
there after everybody.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.970 align:middle line:90%
And those people are busy.

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:25.740 align:middle line:90%
They just don't sit and gossip.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:26.730 align:middle line:90%
They're gone.

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And then they come in and
get their stuff and move on.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.080 align:middle line:90%
We were left with nothing.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I know.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.700 align:middle line:84%
It was the whole thing, which
was just so usurious and rude,

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.480 align:middle line:84%
just to take
advantage of someone

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.680 align:middle line:84%
and to set you up as another
delusional human being who

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.240 align:middle line:90%
thinks they saw something.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.240 align:middle line:90%
So done with them, OK.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.940 align:middle line:84%
It now starts getting
interesting because now,

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.840 align:middle line:84%
some of the government
start showing up.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Some of the alphabet soup
agencies and their people

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:55.580 align:middle line:90%
start showing up.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:59.340 align:middle line:84%
So tell us where that began
and where you first started--

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.900 align:middle line:90%
and we'll get into Tim Taylor--

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.920 align:middle line:84%
where you first started
really feeling like someone

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.980 align:middle line:90%
got what was going on here.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: This is crazy
because my MUFON experience was

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.810 align:middle line:84%
being around those
people for a long time,

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:18.780 align:middle line:90%
for three or four months.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.990 align:middle line:84%
The Men in Black show was a
really big thing then, right?

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:23.010 align:middle line:90%
It was going on.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And so my whole family was
terrified of the government.

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.670 align:middle line:84%
They kept telling us,
you can't trust them.

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And we heard all
this over and over.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:37.160 align:middle line:10%
Well, along about October of
2008, my son calls me one day.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.010 align:middle line:10%
And I'm in town.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:41.420 align:middle line:10%
And he says, dad, there's
this real big guy.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.490 align:middle line:10%
He's at the door.

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:44.440 align:middle line:90%
And he says he's from NASA.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.107 align:middle line:90%
And he wants to see you.

00:20:47.107 --> 00:20:48.440 align:middle line:90%
What do you want me to tell him?

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And they were terrified
of this government guy.

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And I said, tell him
I'll be home in an hour,

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:55.430 align:middle line:84%
to stick around if
he wants to talk.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:56.840 align:middle line:90%
And so he did.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And that was Dr. Hal Povenmire,
which we grew up to love him.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.830 align:middle line:10%
And that meeting
ended up 11 years

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:09.720 align:middle line:10%
until he passed away in 2019.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.188 align:middle line:84%
He was one of our
best advocates.

00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:13.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And who was he with?

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.737 align:middle line:90%
And what did he want from you?

00:21:14.737 --> 00:21:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: He worked with NASA.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what
did he want from you?

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.530 align:middle line:90%
What was he looking for?

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:19.363 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: He came.

00:21:19.363 --> 00:21:21.250 align:middle line:84%
He told us when he
first came, his job was

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:25.340 align:middle line:84%
to debunk the whole thing, to
find any hole they could find.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:30.290 align:middle line:84%
He snooped around town at all
the banks, to the neighbors,

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.780 align:middle line:84%
to where he went
out in the country

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.960 align:middle line:84%
and did a deeper
investigation than MUFON did.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And he found eight
other witnesses

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:39.950 align:middle line:90%
that all saw it that same night.

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And by the time-- his first
few months he was there,

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.550 align:middle line:84%
he was my best
advocate at that point.

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, honestly, how
could someone be around you

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.030 align:middle line:84%
and not get the
sense of truthfulness

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:53.120 align:middle line:90%
in what you're saying?

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and that people
did those horrible things,

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:59.440 align:middle line:84%
it's like kicking a
bunny-- oh, so upsetting.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Then another thing, let's
talk about Tim Taylor.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Timothy Taylor.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Tim, I met him in
Pennsylvania at a gathering.

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:12.250 align:middle line:84%
I was invited to a personal
private group of guys

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:14.740 align:middle line:90%
up in-- it was some publishers.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:18.020 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to entertain
me and court me.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And actually, Taylor
found out I was there

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:26.120 align:middle line:84%
and left California and flew in
just for one day, one evening.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk about his
background, who he was with.

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Taylor's a ghost.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a million people
who want to meet this guy

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:35.860 align:middle line:90%
and very few ever do.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Because he works
with NASA, but he

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.970 align:middle line:84%
works in the capacity of the
National Reconnaissance Office,

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:47.217 align:middle line:90%
meaning his credentials are--

00:22:47.217 --> 00:22:48.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Top, top, top secret.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: This thick
of CIA, NASA, Air Force.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:53.610 align:middle line:90%
He's part of all that.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Area 51, He can walk
right in the door.

00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So he's charged with
deeply examining phenomena?

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah,
there's a lot there.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.440 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell,
but I can't, what

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.680 align:middle line:90%
they were into at that time.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say here's another
military guy, another government

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.200 align:middle line:90%
person.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid of him.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.730 align:middle line:84%
It took me a long time to
get satisfied with how,

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:24.000 align:middle line:84%
and now here's another NASA guy,
clearly very deeply involved,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:84%
pretty much runs all
the launches for NASA.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.680 align:middle line:90%
He's the man in charge.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.210 align:middle line:90%
And I asked him--

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:32.620 align:middle line:90%
I said, why are you here?

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.150 align:middle line:90%
Why are you bothering me?

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:37.920 align:middle line:84%
You guys have telescopes and
space shuttles and rockets

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.960 align:middle line:84%
and all the money and the
scientists in the world.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.070 align:middle line:84%
But you're here
in North Carolina,

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:46.720 align:middle line:84%
pretty much scaring my
family and my children.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.640 align:middle line:90%
And why do you need me?

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.090 align:middle line:90%
He said, oh, we see it.

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:52.310 align:middle line:90%
We know it's there.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.110 align:middle line:90%
We see it.

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:56.100 align:middle line:84%
But it has nothing
to do with us, not

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.410 align:middle line:90%
on a conversational level.

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What did he
mean with we see "it"?

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Well, let's just say
there's a little bit coming out

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:08.970 align:middle line:84%
in the news here lately about
these beings made of light that

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:11.410 align:middle line:84%
kind of harassed
the guys on board--

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.750 align:middle line:84%
rockets and
spaceships and stuff--

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:15.240 align:middle line:90%
scared them.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And they were
wondering what they

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.230 align:middle line:84%
want because they knew
I was conversating

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:24.180 align:middle line:84%
with it, without going
much further there.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So he knew that
you had relationship with him.

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:30.150 align:middle line:84%
By now, it's known
or you're starting

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:35.580 align:middle line:84%
to figure out that these large
balls of light follow you.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.637 align:middle line:84%
And it was starting
to become known

00:24:37.637 --> 00:24:39.720 align:middle line:84%
that if someone would come
and could get your time

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.137 align:middle line:84%
and hang out with
you long enough,

00:24:41.137 --> 00:24:42.705 align:middle line:90%
they'd get to see him too.

00:24:42.705 --> 00:24:43.020 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So he wanted to
experience some phenomena while

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:46.120 align:middle line:90%
he was with you?

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.745 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Well, he did, but he
was more about wanting to know

00:24:48.745 --> 00:24:53.257 align:middle line:84%
why the phenomenon was
doing what it was doing.

00:24:53.257 --> 00:24:55.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, the question
that came up with a couple

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:58.510 align:middle line:84%
of these guys is-- and we'll get
into another player in a minute,

00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:59.340 align:middle line:90%
key player--

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:02.770 align:middle line:90%
is why are they talking to you?

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:04.720 align:middle line:90%
Why you and not us?

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.560 align:middle line:84%
We're doing everything we
can to create relationships

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.190 align:middle line:90%
with whomever.

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:12.112 align:middle line:84%
And they wouldn't talk
to him, but why you?

00:25:12.112 --> 00:25:13.570 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Well,
he asked me that.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:16.980 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in my book,
you'll read this point

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:21.480 align:middle line:84%
to where when he first came,
he tested my whole family

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:27.270 align:middle line:84%
with metal from supposedly
crashed machines, which

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:28.930 align:middle line:90%
he told me they don't crash.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:31.620 align:middle line:84%
That was a misnomer
that it was a gift.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:36.230 align:middle line:90%
But the metal he had was--

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:38.500 align:middle line:90%
he put a piece in one hand.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like a postage
stamp, gray aluminum.

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:44.040 align:middle line:84%
The piece he put
in my other hand,

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.020 align:middle line:84%
it didn't bother
me with this piece.

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.720 align:middle line:84%
But when he put this
other piece in this hand,

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.790 align:middle line:84%
he called that the insulation,
which looked like--

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:55.430 align:middle line:90%
it looked like aluminum foil.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:59.220 align:middle line:84%
But you could smush it,
and it would roll back out.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:03.092 align:middle line:84%
It had rolls in it, but
no pleats or no creases.

00:26:03.092 --> 00:26:05.630 align:middle line:84%
But that these two
pieces undoubtedly

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.220 align:middle line:90%
connected something in here.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And it caused this reaction
that he quickly grabbed it out

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:12.960 align:middle line:90%
of my hand.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.130 align:middle line:90%
And he got right in my face.

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me
and he said, why you?

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.990 align:middle line:84%
I said, what do
you mean, why me?

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:20.540 align:middle line:90%
What just happened?

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.130 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I would have
known you were not truthful

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:23.930 align:middle line:90%
hadn't--

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:26.970 align:middle line:84%
if you hadn't a
reaction to this metal.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:29.220 align:middle line:84%
He said, I've only
ever seen two others,

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.405 align:middle line:90%
but nothing like this one.

00:26:31.405 --> 00:26:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And your reaction,
was it more of an energetic

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:36.830 align:middle line:84%
build-up and shuddering that
was happening inside you?

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah, it was like
my eyes rolled back in my head.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:44.680 align:middle line:10%
And I just had this
black there for a minute.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.620 align:middle line:84%
I was blacking out, and he
grabbed it out of my hand.

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now this metal, I've
heard about also in the Trinity

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:54.400 align:middle line:84%
case, for example, where some
of that metal was left behind

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.310 align:middle line:90%
to examine.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.810 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of-- there are
a few different places I want

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:03.970 align:middle line:84%
to go with this, but this
metal was taken from you

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:05.570 align:middle line:90%
to be examined.

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:08.480 align:middle line:84%
But of course, as in every
case, never to be returned.

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Right,
yeah, I had some of it.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.210 align:middle line:84%
The metal Tim tested
me with was not mine.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:17.735 align:middle line:84%
It came from wherever
they got it from.

00:27:17.735 --> 00:27:23.590 align:middle line:84%
But there was a point
later that I ended up

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:27.292 align:middle line:84%
having four pieces of this
that was dripping from an orb--

00:27:27.292 --> 00:27:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, this is what
I wanted to talk to you about.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:30.650 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: --drip metal.

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:33.108 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I want to talk to
you about this because that is

00:27:33.108 --> 00:27:35.180 align:middle line:84%
the only place I've
ever read that.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:38.570 align:middle line:84%
I have read that they
are found around craft.

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And in craft, these
scraps have been such

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:45.710 align:middle line:84%
as Paula Harris and
the Trinity case.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:51.320 align:middle line:84%
But I never heard anything
about them oozing or dripping

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.260 align:middle line:90%
this metal from orbs.

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what you can about this
because this is fascinating.

00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Well, it does,
and it looks like if you were

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.840 align:middle line:90%
soldering something.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:10.520 align:middle line:84%
These blobs of molten metal
falls off of it, drips right off

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.090 align:middle line:90%
the crack off these orbs.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:13.430 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, the biggest piece--

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:15.260 align:middle line:90%
I'll show you a photo later--

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:21.410 align:middle line:84%
was about twice as big as a golf
ball that I've held in my hand

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:23.400 align:middle line:90%
or had access to.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.090 align:middle line:84%
But usually it's small, like
a marble or less-- you know,

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:29.460 align:middle line:84%
little or smaller
even splatters.

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:33.413 align:middle line:84%
When it hits the ground,
it'll look like a splatter.

00:28:33.413 --> 00:28:35.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: If I heard
or read correctly,

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.800 align:middle line:84%
this is the metal that's
smooth like aluminum.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And you can crumple it up, but
it pops right back out smooth

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.160 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Well, that was
the piece that Taylor tested.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, that's more
like the one that they found

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.310 align:middle line:90%
at Trinity, right?

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Except who knows, it may
have been from Trinity.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.190 align:middle line:84%
So the ones that you
pick up are more-- once

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:57.930 align:middle line:84%
this oozes from an orb,
what's the final metal

00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:59.580 align:middle line:90%
like in your hand?

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: It looks like a
drop of slag from welding or--

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So it's just round?

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:05.585 align:middle line:84%
It's just a little
piece of metal?

00:29:05.585 --> 00:29:07.252 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah,
little balls of metal.

00:29:07.252 --> 00:29:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I assume that
those have been analyzed?

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:15.810 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah, I was asked to
let a couple of different people

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:16.680 align:middle line:90%
look at it.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Did you
let Lou Alessandro--

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: I did.

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:20.013 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --take a piece?

00:29:20.013 --> 00:29:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And he's been one of the key
people that's been testifying

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.130 align:middle line:90%
in the Congressional hearings.

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:26.590 align:middle line:84%
So I know you never
got the metal back,

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:29.650 align:middle line:84%
but what did you find out about
the composition of the metal,

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:30.990 align:middle line:90%
if you're free to say?

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: They never told
me that particular piece,

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:35.880 align:middle line:90%
the composition.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.050 align:middle line:84%
They just told me the
government found it.

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:41.950 align:middle line:84%
It was authentic and
that it was classified.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And I would not be getting
it back to chalk it up,

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:46.175 align:middle line:90%
one for the country.

00:29:46.175 --> 00:29:48.978 align:middle line:90%


00:29:48.978 --> 00:29:53.530 align:middle line:84%
But the pieces I have
been involved with NASA,

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:57.430 align:middle line:84%
I've seen the papers
on these things.

00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And particularly the
one I have, I still

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:01.740 align:middle line:90%
have the documents on it.

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:05.670 align:middle line:84%
It says it has 51
elements in it, including

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:09.310 align:middle line:90%
human DNA in the metal.

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me and
he said, how did they

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:14.080 align:middle line:90%
get human DNA in the metal?

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.610 align:middle line:90%
How do you think they did that?

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:17.920 align:middle line:90%
He said, we can't figure it out.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And since then, they have
achieved that bonding.

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:26.160 align:middle line:84%
But they did it in zero
gravity through a ceramic,

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.390 align:middle line:90%
so they could put--

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To blend
human DNA in with it?

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.330 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Into the metal,
how they could reproduce that.

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't do it the
way whoever did it did it.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.310 align:middle line:84%
But they're doing it
for medical devices.

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:42.650 align:middle line:84%
If you have a spinal
implant, the whole key

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:47.232 align:middle line:84%
is to get your body and your
tissue to grow to this metal.

00:30:47.232 --> 00:30:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that's a
good use of the technology.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Well, that's
what they're doing.

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:50.935 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: For sure.

00:30:50.935 --> 00:30:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, this brings
us to human DNA.

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.630 align:middle line:90%
They must have taken your blood.

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:55.950 align:middle line:90%
You must have been analyzed.

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:57.992 align:middle line:84%
I know you were analyzed
a lot of different ways,

00:30:57.992 --> 00:31:00.135 align:middle line:90%
but did they take your blood?

00:31:00.135 --> 00:31:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Through
the phenomenon or--

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.830 align:middle line:84%
One of the alphabet soup
agencies along the way,

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:06.360 align:middle line:84%
did they ever draw
blood from you?

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: No.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.880 align:middle line:84%
They want to, but
I've never let them.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You never let them.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.070 align:middle line:90%
I always wondered about that.

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:13.737 align:middle line:84%
I thought, surely they must have
tried to get your blood by now,

00:31:13.737 --> 00:31:15.420 align:middle line:84%
find out what your
DNA is all about.

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: They've
been researching my DNA

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.527 align:middle line:90%
and my history.

00:31:19.527 --> 00:31:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And I had to go
through all that.

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.800 align:middle line:84%
That's how I knew about the
connection to King Henry

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:31.233 align:middle line:84%
VII in England-- was
through this research.

00:31:31.233 --> 00:31:33.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So is this
still a bloodline thing?

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:34.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't know.

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I mean, of some kind?

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: That's
their thought.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.820 align:middle line:84%
They're researching
every avenue.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:46.790 align:middle line:84%
All I know is to
me, it's a thought.

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:49.730 align:middle line:84%
They've studied my brain more
than anything-- you know,

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:52.080 align:middle line:90%
a lot of EEG, wiring it up.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, does it look
any different or doesn't?

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Well,
according to them, it does.

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:00.960 align:middle line:84%
It's probably still
running in algorithms now,

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.620 align:middle line:84%
the last six hours of
brain scans they took.

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:08.480 align:middle line:84%
But they told me that
what they see there--

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.530 align:middle line:84%
and they said this on
the History Channel.

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:13.430 align:middle line:84%
We did an episode on
Beyond Skinwalker.

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Thomas there, James,
he's a PhD in neuroscience.

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:24.090 align:middle line:84%
He's a neuroscientist,
professor of it from New York.

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:25.910 align:middle line:90%
And he analyzed it.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And he said it looked like if
a Buddhist monk was able to,

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:36.330 align:middle line:84%
for 40 years, meditate till
he got to this highly--

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Gamma.

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:38.760 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah, state--

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:44.330 align:middle line:84%
that I'm able to do that
in a second without trying.

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:47.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this had
other lovely consequences

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:49.940 align:middle line:84%
because after this
first encounter,

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:52.970 align:middle line:90%
you were able to use your love.

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:53.960 align:middle line:90%
And this is the thing.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:54.835 align:middle line:90%
You knew how to pray.

00:32:54.835 --> 00:32:56.130 align:middle line:90%
You know how to love.

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:59.150 align:middle line:84%
You know how to be
undistracted and clear.

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And you've been able to
help many, many people

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.590 align:middle line:84%
on their healing from
deathbed experiences

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:08.290 align:middle line:84%
through their healing journeys
just by your sheer intention

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:09.670 align:middle line:90%
and love for them.

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:11.200 align:middle line:90%
But what happened one day with--

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.090 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Tim
Taylor, wasn't it?

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:15.055 align:middle line:84%
Your dog, Nellie,
came running in.

00:33:15.055 --> 00:33:16.180 align:middle line:90%
Was that with Tim who was--

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: No, that
was with Grant Cameron.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Grant Cameron, OK.

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:21.010 align:middle line:84%
He was in the room
because everybody

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:23.680 align:middle line:84%
came to your place to
examine you and talk to you

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:24.920 align:middle line:90%
and get to know you--

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.350 align:middle line:90%
get the inside skinny.

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And your dog, Nellie,
who you dearly love,

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.680 align:middle line:90%
came running in with a big gash.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah, what
it was, we were outside.

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.390 align:middle line:90%
Grant called me.

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And he was in Miami, heading
back to Canada, driving.

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:40.092 align:middle line:84%
He called me and said, I
want to stop by and visit.

00:33:40.092 --> 00:33:41.800 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, you can
come stay the night

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.430 align:middle line:90%
if you want on your trip up.

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:45.070 align:middle line:90%
So he made it.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:48.520 align:middle line:84%
We're in North Carolina,
so we're right on 95.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:52.050 align:middle line:84%
So he gets there in the
evening and he's like, I

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:53.270 align:middle line:90%
want to see the burning tree.

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:54.980 align:middle line:90%
I just got to see the tree.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.960 align:middle line:84%
So we went out and
he has his camera.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.700 align:middle line:84%
He's taking pictures
of the tree.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And Nellie, my lab,
was walking with us.

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:02.707 align:middle line:84%
And she'd lay down
while we talk.

00:34:02.707 --> 00:34:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And when we'd walk, she'd
get up and walk with us.

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:08.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, we got back to the house.

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:09.969 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what happened.

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:12.800 align:middle line:84%
All I know, we were 20
feet from the back door.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.860 align:middle line:84%
All my kids are out on the
back patio with some friends.

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at Grant and I
said, do you want to just--

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.400 align:middle line:84%
I can get the kids get
your bags if you want

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.199 align:middle line:90%
and put them in your room.

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:24.590 align:middle line:90%
And he said, sure.

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:26.199 align:middle line:90%
So he turns his back to me.

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And he's in front of me,
between me and the house.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.730 align:middle line:84%
So when he turns his back to me
and starts toward the back door,

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:33.679 align:middle line:90%
Nellie's laying on the ground.

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:35.030 align:middle line:90%
She stands up.

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:37.150 align:middle line:90%
And when she ran by him--

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:39.290 align:middle line:84%
when she passed me and
when she ran by him,

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:42.489 align:middle line:84%
I saw blood shoot
out of her neck

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:45.469 align:middle line:84%
and wet his pants
down in the ground.

00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And she ran into the back door
of the house, bleeding to death.

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:50.330 align:middle line:90%
And I panicked.

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:51.130 align:middle line:90%
I ran in--

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You said,
it was a big gash--

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:53.290 align:middle line:84%
three fingers you
could stick there.

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:54.199 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah, three fingers.

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:56.199 align:middle line:84%
You could go out of
sight that deep in a hole

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:57.640 align:middle line:90%
right across here.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I ran in the
door, and I tackled her.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm freaking out bad.

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:02.750 align:middle line:90%
What's going on with my dog?

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And I bring her outside,
and I lay her on the patio.

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And all the kids are
over me, looking.

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm on my knees with
my hand on her neck.

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm crying out,
somebody get me a rag!

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:14.360 align:middle line:90%
Somebody help me!

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.780 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to put
a compression on it.

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:20.950 align:middle line:84%
When I realized she wasn't going
to live that 30-minute drive

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:22.220 align:middle line:90%
to the nearest vet--

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.650 align:middle line:84%
she'd bleed to death
before that happened.

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:32.670 align:middle line:84%
I just reached out to the
heavens and a big, please help.

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:34.200 align:middle line:90%
That's all I did.

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.930 align:middle line:84%
But I felt it, and I
felt her become limp.

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:39.850 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly, she quit struggling.

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And when I raised my hand
up, the hole was gone,

00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:44.680 align:middle line:90%
and everybody saw that.

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:45.930 align:middle line:90%
[REGINA LAUGHS]

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:46.830 align:middle line:90%
Ooh.

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:50.463 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of
the beautiful things

00:35:50.463 --> 00:35:52.380 align:middle line:84%
is this ability that
you've been able to share

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:56.320 align:middle line:84%
with many, many people to help
them in their healing process--

00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:00.210 align:middle line:84%
facilitate really, truly
miraculous types of healings.

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:01.420 align:middle line:90%
And that's been a blessing.

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: It's a burden for me
because there's so many people

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.250 align:middle line:90%
that are sick.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:10.892 align:middle line:84%
But I'll never stop
because we have to try.

00:36:10.892 --> 00:36:14.910 align:middle line:84%
When I say it's a burden, it's
because there's a never ending

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:18.122 align:middle line:90%
line of people that need help.

00:36:18.122 --> 00:36:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's go
now to the lady in--

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.800 align:middle line:84%
your association
with the lady, what

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.770 align:middle line:84%
the-- when you first met the
lady, what the lady appeared

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:27.600 align:middle line:84%
like and your
visit with the lady

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:33.100 align:middle line:84%
in the canyon, when she told
you about this date in 2026.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: OK, I have to fill
in a little more about that too.

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:40.810 align:middle line:84%
So five years later, after
it happened, it was January.

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:47.100 align:middle line:90%
It was on April of 2012, Easter.

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.175 align:middle line:90%
I was at the point in my life--

00:36:49.175 --> 00:36:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And Easter plays
large in your life too.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:51.990 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: It's always--

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:54.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You love Easter,
and they come to you on Easter.

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:55.420 align:middle line:90%
Easter is big.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.045 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: That's
when the lady comes.

00:36:57.045 --> 00:37:02.070 align:middle line:84%
Every year at Easter, I know
she's coming and pretty much has

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:05.500 align:middle line:84%
at least four or five
different times since then,

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:06.333 align:middle line:90%
including this year.

00:37:06.333 --> 00:37:07.133 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh.

00:37:07.133 --> 00:37:08.040 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:16.170 align:middle line:84%
So I was struggling bad with
my kids and their tears and all

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:17.340 align:middle line:90%
the thing.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I was carrying this burden
that I brought this.

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:21.070 align:middle line:90%
I've ruined my children's lives.

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:24.420 align:middle line:84%
My boys were young teenagers
interested in girls,

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.600 align:middle line:90%
and now they're all messed up.

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And so that night, the night
before Easter morning, I

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:38.090 align:middle line:84%
went outside and
shouted at the heavens.

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:39.660 align:middle line:90%
Why did you do this to me?

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:43.410 align:middle line:84%
You healed me, but now
my children are ruined.

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:46.880 align:middle line:84%
This is what I was
saying to the heavens.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And I get emotional
thinking about all that.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:59.398 align:middle line:84%
So I had a good shouting
match with stars.

00:37:59.398 --> 00:38:00.690 align:middle line:90%
And I knew they were listening.

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:01.590 align:middle line:90%
They always do.

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:04.380 align:middle line:84%
I never quit seeing them
from the time they took me

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.510 align:middle line:90%
until today or tomorrow.

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:09.170 align:middle line:84%
If I go out tonight, I'll
probably see them here.

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:10.680 align:middle line:90%
They're always there.

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:14.560 align:middle line:84%
So I was really seriously
talking to the phenomenon.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.360 align:middle line:90%
And I quit.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.790 align:middle line:84%
I am never going to
talk about this again,

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:20.820 align:middle line:84%
even though I had the biggest
desire to tell the world.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:21.960 align:middle line:90%
They put that in me.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:26.370 align:middle line:84%
It's like Richard Dreyfuss
in the mashed potatoes.

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:27.290 align:middle line:90%
That's been me.

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The Close Encounters
of the Third Kind, yeah.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.401 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Right.

00:38:31.401 --> 00:38:36.580 align:middle line:84%
But anyhow, I went in at 9:30,
upset after that shouting

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:37.380 align:middle line:90%
session--

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:38.180 align:middle line:90%
went to bed.

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:41.960 align:middle line:84%
2 o'clock in the morning, I hear
a loud, thunderous, manly voice

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.790 align:middle line:90%
that said, arise.

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Next thing I know, I'm being
led outside, fully dressed.

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:49.650 align:middle line:90%
I was not dressed.

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:50.940 align:middle line:90%
I was asleep.

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And I got up and put all
my clothes on and shoes on.

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:54.690 align:middle line:90%
And out the back door.

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:57.680 align:middle line:84%
I went to a spot
in the woods where

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:01.610 align:middle line:84%
I had experienced these
little beings in 2007

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:04.490 align:middle line:90%
with Chris Jenner.

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And never expected
to see what I saw.

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:11.490 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea why I was
going out there or what.

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:13.890 align:middle line:84%
I just felt like
I had no control.

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Something had me in tow
and told me to get dressed.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I know,
Regina, one of them--

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:24.020 align:middle line:84%
there were three
shadowy figures--

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:25.790 align:middle line:84%
reaches out with
two hands like this.

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And he hands me this object
that was about yay long,

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:33.260 align:middle line:90%
like a pack of hamburger tube.

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:36.590 align:middle line:84%
But it was furry, felt
like a living animal.

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:38.030 align:middle line:90%
And it was in the dark.

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:38.870 align:middle line:90%
And it scared me.

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:39.915 align:middle line:90%
And it kind of prickles.

00:39:39.915 --> 00:39:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No limbs?

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: No limbs,
no legs, no head--

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.990 align:middle line:84%
but it felt like
a living squirrel,

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:46.676 align:middle line:84%
about the size of
a good squirrel.

00:39:46.676 --> 00:39:49.870 align:middle line:84%
But it felt like a
hedgehog, that kind of feel.

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:51.520 align:middle line:90%
So I dropped it real quick.

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And this voice said,
no, pick it up.

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:54.710 align:middle line:90%
You got to keep that.

00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:56.840 align:middle line:90%
So I reached down to pick it up.

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.540 align:middle line:90%
There were no more beings there.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.870 align:middle line:84%
So I'm in the woods
now, next to the dog

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:05.000 align:middle line:84%
kennel with this strange
object in my hand.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.090 align:middle line:84%
So I ran over and opened the
dog kennel, one of them--

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:09.700 align:middle line:90%
my dad has a huge kennel--

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and stuck it in and
closed the door.

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Not like it
could run anywhere, but--

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Right, but I
wanted to keep that thing.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:16.970 align:middle line:90%
He said, keep it.

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:17.840 align:middle line:90%
You got to keep it.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.470 align:middle line:90%
So I was afraid of losing it.

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:24.320 align:middle line:84%
The very second I
did that, this wind--

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.370 align:middle line:90%
that's all I can say, the wind.

00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And the definition of
spirit is the wind.

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:33.980 align:middle line:84%
That's what the word
spirit means, the wind.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:41.180 align:middle line:84%
The Holy Spirit means the breath
of God, that wind, the mother,

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:42.350 align:middle line:90%
the Gaia.

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:49.210 align:middle line:84%
The next thing I know, out
of that wind came this cow.

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And I can't tell you,
my hair's standing up.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Was it like a bull?

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:54.833 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: It was a bull.

00:40:54.833 --> 00:40:56.020 align:middle line:90%
It was a bull.

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:57.500 align:middle line:90%
It was translucent.

00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:59.170 align:middle line:90%
Here's the weirdest thing.

00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:02.187 align:middle line:84%
I saw the stars in its
body as it went over.

00:41:02.187 --> 00:41:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because
it was translucent.

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah, maintained
that for all these years.

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:09.190 align:middle line:84%
When I met with
Robert Grant recently,

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:11.690 align:middle line:90%
I did this tour in the pyramids.

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:13.265 align:middle line:10%
And that same bull--

00:41:13.265 --> 00:41:14.140 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: The stars.

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:16.680 align:middle line:10%
>> BLEDSOE: --is in the
side of the king's chamber.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.480 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.400 align:middle line:10%
>> BLEDSOE: How weird is that?

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.200 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: So now,
this bull runs over me.

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't hurt me, but
I see it go over me.

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And the wind is what
blew me down backwards,

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:28.660 align:middle line:90%
all the way onto the ground.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:31.540 align:middle line:84%
So I rolled on my
stomach to get up to run.

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And when I did, there was
the most beautiful woman

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:40.810 align:middle line:84%
that I can't describe
with words how beautiful.

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Pure grace, pure
light, pure beauty and love.

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:45.900 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Bluish
white light around her.

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:49.240 align:middle line:90%
Her dress was white with rolls--

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.830 align:middle line:90%
not pleats, but rolls.

00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like the stars
in the sky inside of her dress.

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:58.230 align:middle line:84%
She had a collar on,
no open anything,

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:00.010 align:middle line:90%
and the sleeves out to here.

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And she was barefooted,
and her dress

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.270 align:middle line:84%
was right on the
top of her feet.

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And she was hovering
three feet off the ground.

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:08.880 align:middle line:90%
She looks at me.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you
know why I'm here.

00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And I knew it hit me
like a ton of bricks

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:22.320 align:middle line:84%
because I'd just quit
a few hours before.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:26.680 align:middle line:84%
She said, this is your
burden you must bear.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.240 align:middle line:90%
You have to do this.

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you do, I will
be with you always.

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'll allow you to film us
and share us on our present,

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.570 align:middle line:90%
on camera and with witnesses.

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Up until that point, I
could see it all the time

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:45.160 align:middle line:84%
and share it with my
kids only or my wife,

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.002 align:middle line:84%
but I could never share
it with anyone else.

00:42:47.002 --> 00:42:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, it wasn't
coming out on film either,

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:50.230 align:middle line:90%
and it did.

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Finally, this phenomenon
started showing up for you.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Immediately,
it flies up.

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And instead of vanishing
when I take my camera out,

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:00.690 align:middle line:90%
it just posed for me.

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:02.820 align:middle line:90%
And now it's--

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk about
what she told you in the canyon

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:07.840 align:middle line:90%
about 2026.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: So the
following year,

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:17.240 align:middle line:84%
this is when Nellie was healed,
two weeks after her visit

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.670 align:middle line:90%
on Easter of 2013.

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:23.070 align:middle line:84%
So she comes again
during Sunday night--

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Saturday night, the
night before Easter.

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And next thing I know,
I'm in a bubble again.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm in an orb.

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.767 align:middle line:84%
And I write about it in
detail, how I got there.

00:43:33.767 --> 00:43:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it looks
like you're almost--

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.113 align:middle line:84%
like you're in the canyon,
a canyon in the Southwest.

00:43:38.113 --> 00:43:39.030 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Yes, I am.

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:42.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm in five years of
research, six years

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.620 align:middle line:84%
of trying to figure out where
that has led me to believe

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:48.060 align:middle line:90%
the four corners is the area--

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:52.710 align:middle line:84%
but maybe Utah, because
of the rock formations,

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:55.650 align:middle line:84%
the color of the ground,
the walls and everything.

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:57.590 align:middle line:90%
I've done a lot of research.

00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:58.880 align:middle line:90%
But she told me--

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.460 align:middle line:90%


00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.680 align:middle line:90%
I was transported to her.

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.850 align:middle line:90%
And I was not with her.

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:09.200 align:middle line:84%
I was with these three
shadowy figures again.

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:12.240 align:middle line:84%
We walked down this
canyon, long canyon.

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:16.130 align:middle line:84%
I could see light up at
the end of the canyon.

00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And what it was, it
was a side canyon that

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:21.330 align:middle line:90%
came out into the main canyon.

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And the light was coming
from that direction.

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:26.940 align:middle line:84%
So we walked and got
closer and closer.

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And when we got
to that end where

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:32.600 align:middle line:84%
we made a left toward
the light, there she was.

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:34.850 align:middle line:90%
She was sitting-- standing.

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:35.700 align:middle line:90%
She wasn't sitting.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:39.230 align:middle line:84%
She was standing in
front of this huge-- what

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:43.680 align:middle line:84%
looked like a huge chair
made onto the mountain,

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:44.720 align:middle line:90%
onto the side.

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And around it, there
were these ruins where

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:50.870 align:middle line:90%
ancient people used to be.

00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And she whispered to me and
told me the weirdest thing.

00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:59.190 align:middle line:90%
I had no clue what it meant.

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:02.780 align:middle line:84%
She said, when the
red star of Regulus--

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:05.900 align:middle line:84%
why she said red, I don't
know because I researched

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.710 align:middle line:90%
and the star seems to be blue.

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:10.970 align:middle line:84%
But maybe it's red when it
appears, where it's going.

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:12.823 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Maybe that
time of day, it's red.

00:45:12.823 --> 00:45:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah,
before daylight.

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:18.940 align:middle line:84%
She said, when the star of
Regulus appears on the horizon--

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:20.210 align:middle line:90%
and I could see it.

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:24.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she gave me the image
of the star eclipsing the sand

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:26.300 align:middle line:90%
in front of the sphinx.

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:30.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'm up above the
pyramids, looking at the rear

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:31.880 align:middle line:90%
of the sphinx facing east.

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And this little star pops
up before the sun comes up.

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:36.760 align:middle line:90%
You can see it plain.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.520 align:middle line:10%
She said, when that
happens, there's

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:43.610 align:middle line:10%
going to be a shift into a
new knowledge for mankind.

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This
is Easter of 2026?

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah.

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And so the only reason
I found that date

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:53.510 align:middle line:84%
is by some friends that
are into astrology.

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and they
were able to locate that.

00:45:56.770 --> 00:45:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And that there would be a
new understanding and a shift

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:01.587 align:middle line:90%
in humanity at that point.

00:46:01.587 --> 00:46:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And you know what,
I have to tell you,

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Chris, a number of
different people

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:07.870 align:middle line:90%
that I've been interviewing--

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:11.420 align:middle line:84%
some of them
channels, others not--

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:15.250 align:middle line:84%
are coming up with
2026, mid 2026.

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:16.967 align:middle line:90%
It's been a repeated theme.

00:46:16.967 --> 00:46:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah,
and to me, I think--

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:23.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't think this day
would be like a light switch

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:25.090 align:middle line:90%
and then there's the big news.

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:31.090 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a shift to this
new walk with another world

00:46:31.090 --> 00:46:33.080 align:middle line:90%
that we thought didn't exist.

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So that's beautiful.

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:36.560 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, when I first
encountered you, read your book

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:46.810 align:middle line:84%
and first interviewed
you, my feeling

00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:49.480 align:middle line:84%
was that you were contacted
because you're intimately

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.930 align:middle line:90%
familiar with these beings.

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps you're
part of their family.

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:54.370 align:middle line:90%
And you came here at this time.

00:46:54.370 --> 00:46:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And you could be worked with so
easily because of your openness

00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:01.760 align:middle line:90%
and your pure heart.

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:04.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you really
have a very pure heart.

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And so whoever
they are, you are.

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:09.070 align:middle line:90%
And you have come.

00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And they have come through you
to show us, yes, we all exist.

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:13.780 align:middle line:90%
We're here.

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Many of us are here,
wishing you well

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:21.310 align:middle line:84%
and wishing you our true journey
into this shift for humankind.

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And do you feel comfortable
with the notion, that notion

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:26.700 align:middle line:90%
that you're one of them?

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Well, I've
struggled with that.

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is
just my feeling.

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: You're not the
only one that says that.

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:39.100 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Dr. Povenmire with
NASA, I ask him many times--

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.160 align:middle line:90%
why is this happening with me?

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.180 align:middle line:90%
And he looked at me one night.

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:44.970 align:middle line:84%
He said, because
it's your family.

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:46.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I get.

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.040 align:middle line:90%
It's your family.

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And so you are the one that was
sent here to do the hard work,

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:54.390 align:middle line:90%
and you have.

00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:55.960 align:middle line:90%
And we're out of time.

00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:58.780 align:middle line:84%
But, shoot, I mean, the White
House has been involved.

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.190 align:middle line:90%
The Vatican has been involved.

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Monroe Institute
blew their machines.

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:02.830 align:middle line:90%
That didn't work.

00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So everybody's trying
to figure you out.

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:08.550 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to me quite simply,
you've come from this place

00:48:08.550 --> 00:48:10.650 align:middle line:84%
with these beings
who are not here

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:12.630 align:middle line:84%
to wish us harm, which
is so disturbing about

00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:14.290 align:middle line:90%
these congressional hearings.

00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Because they're trying to treat
it as though it's a threat.

00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Even people who had the
opposite story earlier,

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:20.850 align:middle line:90%
we know all these people.

00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:22.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm not happy about
why they're doing this.

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm guessing it's
for money to get

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.890 align:middle line:84%
a budget going for
something that's

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:28.080 align:middle line:90%
a threat to national security.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.920 align:middle line:10%
>> BLEDSOE: A little birdie
on the inside told me--

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:35.880 align:middle line:10%
it's a big birdie, not little.

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.690 align:middle line:10%
I asked them, why
are they doing this?

00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:42.510 align:middle line:10%
And he said, well, I think
it's probably because they

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:43.860 align:middle line:10%
can't control this.

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:45.850 align:middle line:10%
And they don't want
us messing with it.

00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So they'd rather label
it dark and negative,

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.260 align:middle line:90%
so we'll leave it alone.

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
no, not happening.

00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:54.787 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: That's
the words I've heard.

00:48:54.787 --> 00:48:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, thank
you for sharing that.

00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for your
huge part in all this.

00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And, well, I just
don't have enough words

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:03.210 align:middle line:84%
to say how much I appreciate
what you've brought forward

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:06.540 align:middle line:84%
and the amount of
pain you've actually

00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:07.900 align:middle line:90%
had to go through to do this.

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:11.160 align:middle line:84%
You've walked your
talk for lifetimes.

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Well,
I appreciate that.

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:14.160 align:middle line:90%
I never quit.

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:15.510 align:middle line:90%
I'll never quit trying.

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:16.310 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There's
a movie coming out?

00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Yeah, well,
that's what they say.

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.798 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They say
there's a movie coming out.

00:49:20.798 --> 00:49:22.963 align:middle line:84%
And I-- because of your
face, and your voice,

00:49:22.963 --> 00:49:23.880 align:middle line:90%
and your countenance--

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:27.330 align:middle line:84%
I want Matthew
McConaughey to play you.

00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:29.390 align:middle line:84%
My dream is that
your story comes out

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:32.420 align:middle line:84%
in living color on the big
screen with Matthew McConaughey,

00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:33.577 align:middle line:90%
playing you.

00:49:33.577 --> 00:49:35.035 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: I've
heard that before.

00:49:35.035 --> 00:49:37.108 align:middle line:90%
- [LAUGHS] We shall see.

00:49:37.108 --> 00:49:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>> BLEDSOE: Everybody says you
sound just like him, you know.

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
and to be continued.

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:45.932 align:middle line:84%
We'll see what happens
with that film.

00:49:45.932 --> 00:49:46.890 align:middle line:90%
>> BLEDSOE: Absolutely.

00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:47.690 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:51.060 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: To read the whole
story, you can find UFO of God,

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:53.040 align:middle line:10%
his book, at major booksellers.

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:56.480 align:middle line:10%
And again, stay tuned for
his life story in the movie

00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.860 align:middle line:10%
theaters, hopefully
sometime down the road here.

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, I think we'll
all be alert to Easter of 2026.

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.
