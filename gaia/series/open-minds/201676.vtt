>>REGINA MEREDITH:
While so many people

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.990 align:middle line:10%
are focused on
what is being lost

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.730 align:middle line:10%
in terms of our
way of life, there

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.460 align:middle line:10%
are others who are focused on
the creation of a new world,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.920 align:middle line:10%
or a new way of life.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Jan Engels-Smith is a
psychotherapist and shaman.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Her work is helping people birth
their own higher frequencies,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.240 align:middle line:84%
which in turn, create
higher outcomes

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.530 align:middle line:90%
in the world around us.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Through experiences
with parallel timelines,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.600 align:middle line:84%
multiple personalities,
and time shifts,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Jan shares the miracle of
what's possible once we

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.130 align:middle line:90%
choose a higher way of living.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.330 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Jan.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.620 align:middle line:90%
I've interviewed you before.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.080 align:middle line:84%
We've had a lot of chats
and been on live shows

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.180 align:middle line:90%
together and so forth.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:84%
But I've never seen
in the flesh till now.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:57.815 align:middle line:90%
You're just as beautiful.

00:00:57.815 --> 00:00:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JAN ENGELS-SMITH:
Well, so are you.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: More beautiful.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: : This is so fun to
actually sit in your presence.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's wonderful
to be with you.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.630 align:middle line:84%
What I love about you is you
have this really clear way

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.630 align:middle line:84%
of articulating themes
that are quite deep.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think your
background, having

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.250 align:middle line:84%
been through rigorous
academics and your work

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.180 align:middle line:84%
as a psychotherapist, really
has set a wonderful framework

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.900 align:middle line:84%
for you to be able to
explain what you experienced

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.260 align:middle line:84%
and what you are here to
teach from the world--

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.640 align:middle line:90%
the worldview of a shaman.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, these are
very separate worlds, but really

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:90%
complementary in your case.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.045 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, exactly.

00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:36.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
start with when you

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.100 align:middle line:84%
were a student,
because this is really

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.950 align:middle line:84%
a launching off point
for you, and I just

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.660 align:middle line:90%
mentioned it a moment ago.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.450 align:middle line:84%
In dealing with multiple
personalities in the world

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:90%
that that opened up to you.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So, please.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.820 align:middle line:10%
That was back-- it was one of
my first jobs out of college

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.220 align:middle line:10%
with my masters
into psychotherapy,

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.100 align:middle line:10%
and I was working in
a dissociative ward

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:10%
in a mental hospital.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.440 align:middle line:10%
And one of the doctors
that I was working with

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.670 align:middle line:10%
was very different.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.120 align:middle line:10%
He was from Africa and
had been brought over.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And he had incredible approaches
with multiple personality

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.180 align:middle line:90%
disorder.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So it brought a lot of
attention to his work,

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and they decided to
film some of our--

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.290 align:middle line:84%
they had a panel
discussion and were

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.090 align:middle line:84%
going to film some
of these really

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.173 align:middle line:90%
extraordinary experiences.

00:02:31.173 --> 00:02:33.548 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean, this
is quite gutsy for the world

00:02:33.548 --> 00:02:34.485 align:middle line:90%
of medicine.

00:02:34.485 --> 00:02:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And this
is back in the '70s.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.643 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, that's
really open-minded.

00:02:39.643 --> 00:02:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It was
very open-minded.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.270 align:middle line:10%
And so anyway, we
had different people

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.480 align:middle line:10%
that had very severe differences
in their different alters,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.510 align:middle line:10%
which is the different
personalities that come out

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.550 align:middle line:10%
with multiple personality.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.270 align:middle line:10%
And one that-- a very dramatic
one had cerebral palsy

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.910 align:middle line:10%
and so he was very deformed.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And they had doctors come
in and measure his bones

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.890 align:middle line:84%
and the atrophy in his muscles,
and all this kind of stuff.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And he diagnosed absolutely,
this is permanent damage.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.410 align:middle line:84%
There could be the
deformation here is absolute.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.670 align:middle line:84%
There could be no
altering this whatsoever.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Had him change alters, and he
turned into like an athletic

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:25.620 align:middle line:90%
looking man.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.730 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was just like, boom.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Seriously?

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Seriously.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, even
physically he could--

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Physically, he turned
into a different stature.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.560 align:middle line:84%
He had no deformities
whatsoever.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.410 align:middle line:84%
The doctor actually
got quite aggravated,

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.160 align:middle line:84%
feeling that there had
been some sort of--

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He'd been played?

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.273 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: He'd been played, yeah.

00:03:43.273 --> 00:03:47.970 align:middle line:84%
But it was astounding to see
what had happened in these two

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.380 align:middle line:90%
different personalities.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And many of these people
had several personalities.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.870 align:middle line:84%
Not just two or
three, like 20, 30.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.300 align:middle line:90%
But these two played out.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Another man was blind and he had
a blue casting over his eyes.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.010 align:middle line:84%
You know how some
blind eyes are--

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like an
opaque, milky blue.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And again, had
different testing done.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.230 align:middle line:84%
There's no light going into the
retina, all this kind of stuff.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:10%
They had all the
medical records.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Changed alters, completely
sighted, you know.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.230 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I just read something
just this morning, actually,

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.160 align:middle line:84%
that Cynthia Sue
Larson sent to me

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.860 align:middle line:84%
that said she also
does, you know,

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.690 align:middle line:84%
the different
parallel realities.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was about a case study of
that right there with multiple.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, they
change in front of your eyes.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.110 align:middle line:84%
So when I was young, this
was so amazing to me.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.890 align:middle line:84%
I had no shamanic
experience at this time.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.780 align:middle line:84%
I'd just graduated
out of school,

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.720 align:middle line:84%
but it had such an impact on
me that I never forgot it.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And so when I then
learned shamanism

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and I saw how people could alter
and change in healing sessions,

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.100 align:middle line:84%
it allowed me to hold the
belief of that being possible.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think when the shaman
holds the belief, when they

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.040 align:middle line:84%
can see you in a
different way, they

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.110 align:middle line:90%
have the ability to see that.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Then that work can
then be transferred

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.680 align:middle line:84%
into the actual
healing experience.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.900 align:middle line:90%
So I want to go back a minute.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:27.700 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.040 align:middle line:84%
We've got a lot to talk
about when people are--

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know many people in
the audience, including myself,

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.410 align:middle line:84%
were saying, well, wait
a minute, what happened?

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.820 align:middle line:84%
So did the man who
had previously,

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.960 align:middle line:84%
as you say he had
physical deformities,

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.965 align:middle line:84%
after the session was
over, what was he?

00:05:45.965 --> 00:05:46.765 align:middle line:90%
Was he--

00:05:46.765 --> 00:05:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: He can be--

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --intact?

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: He can be any of
them that he chooses to be.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:51.850 align:middle line:90%
They're all different--

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.183 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even though they
had tested him neurologically

00:05:54.183 --> 00:05:55.840 align:middle line:84%
and said, no, this
chronic disease

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.610 align:middle line:84%
has overtaken his nervous
system and it's impossible?

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:00.507 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And so the--

00:06:00.507 --> 00:06:01.965 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what's
going on there?

00:06:01.965 --> 00:06:04.378 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, you have the
medical reason and now--

00:06:04.378 --> 00:06:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, not
the medical reason.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.980 align:middle line:90%
What's the real reason?

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.897 align:middle line:90%
What's going on there?

00:06:07.897 --> 00:06:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: What I'm
interested-- and I can't say--

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.780 align:middle line:84%
speak, you know,
absolute, but the more I'm

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.910 align:middle line:84%
learning about
parallel realities

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:21.265 align:middle line:84%
and how we have multiple
versions of ourselves in any--

00:06:21.265 --> 00:06:25.960 align:middle line:84%
any possibility is possible
for any moment in time

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.160 align:middle line:90%
for yourself.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.602 align:middle line:84%
I'm realizing that that is
one of the ways a possibility

00:06:31.602 --> 00:06:32.560 align:middle line:90%
that's happening there.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this paper was
on in "Scientific American."

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:36.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.890 align:middle line:10%
So in your parlance, that
might be parallel lifetimes.

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, not
really lifetimes

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.175 align:middle line:90%
because it's one lifetime.

00:06:45.175 --> 00:06:46.325 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's parallel--

00:06:46.325 --> 00:06:47.125 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Realities.

00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:48.042 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --realities?

00:06:48.042 --> 00:06:51.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Parallel
expressions of self.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I mean, the
same soul motivating it?

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Same soul.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Choosing to have a
lot of different expressions

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.715 align:middle line:90%
within a given lifetime?

00:06:58.715 --> 00:06:59.515 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:06:59.515 --> 00:07:01.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
what we might be seeing

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.235 align:middle line:90%
with multiple personalities?

00:07:02.235 --> 00:07:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It could be.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It could be.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And what we can
be doing for ourselves.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.650 align:middle line:10%
Like where I take
this now, you know,

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.140 align:middle line:10%
to me this is about healing.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a
person that you're

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.890 align:middle line:84%
working on that has
something chronic,

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and we're doing
shamanic work, we're

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.210 align:middle line:84%
doing ceremony and various
things like that in order

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:27.310 align:middle line:84%
to possibly get them to
shift, or to have a miracle,

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.010 align:middle line:84%
or to have this
healing take place.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.740 align:middle line:84%
But what if it's
more of shifting

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.950 align:middle line:84%
into a parallel dimension,
into a parallel reality where

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.430 align:middle line:84%
you don't have that
expressed illness?

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.365 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm very
curious about, how to do that.

00:07:42.365 --> 00:07:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And also, the fact that
you would have in this one

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.290 align:middle line:84%
situation you spoke about a
person sighted in one reality

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:51.940 align:middle line:90%
and blind in another.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in a sense, you look
at the fast track to learning

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.060 align:middle line:84%
to have both of these
experiences within a given

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.050 align:middle line:90%
lifetime.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's interesting
on a soul development level.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:02.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh, for sure.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And again, some of these
people would have, you know,

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.650 align:middle line:90%
10, 20 different personalities.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Like I had a client that her
main alter was about five years

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.405 align:middle line:90%
old and even though she--

00:08:16.405 --> 00:08:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And her
physical age was what?

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: She was
probably in her 30s.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, when we
were doing our sessions,

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.200 align:middle line:84%
I'd have her bring her
dolls and stuff like that.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.060 align:middle line:90%
We do it that way.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.727 align:middle line:84%
But then when we were
done, I'd say, OK,

00:08:27.727 --> 00:08:30.130 align:middle line:84%
you need to bring in anybody
over 16 to drive you home.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.495 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:08:32.495 --> 00:08:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she could
functionally do that?

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:35.203 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:08:35.203 --> 00:08:37.179 align:middle line:90%
They can just change on a dime.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, the big difference
that I'm seeing

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.850 align:middle line:84%
how you and I can
change realities, which

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:45.630 align:middle line:90%
we are doing all the time.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, we are shifting
into parallel realities,

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.360 align:middle line:84%
different expressions
of ourselves.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.300 align:middle line:90%
Our intentions do that for us.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.070 align:middle line:90%
Our prayers do that for us.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.400 align:middle line:84%
But then what we tend
to do is we go back

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.480 align:middle line:84%
and we remember
the old problems.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And that memory then shifts us
back into that old expression.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:08.650 align:middle line:90%
We're jumping back and forth.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.780 align:middle line:84%
The difference with
multiple people

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.220 align:middle line:90%
is they don't have the memory.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.375 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:13.375 --> 00:09:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And when they shift,
they honestly don't know that

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:18.550 align:middle line:90%
they were this--

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't know this
other limitation, for example,

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.670 align:middle line:90%
or possibility even.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:22.830 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.470 align:middle line:84%
They're completely shifting
into that life expression,

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.430 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness of themselves
in that life expression.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Where when you and I shift,
we're shifting with memory.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, that's where
a lot of my work is now

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.430 align:middle line:84%
and how to get people to shift
and really live as if they're

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.403 align:middle line:90%
in that new expression.

00:09:44.403 --> 00:09:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
thank you for that

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.470 align:middle line:84%
as a little intro to
a larger conversation,

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.040 align:middle line:84%
because now we're going
to go into, again,

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.700 align:middle line:90%
a notion of a parallel reality.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
parallel timelines,

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:59.200 align:middle line:84%
and it all really becomes quite
confusing for an individual.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.100 align:middle line:90%
But I love this story.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.190 align:middle line:84%
So let's start
with the story when

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:05.340 align:middle line:84%
you would go to the retreat
area with the boulder.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.010 align:middle line:90%
The boulder story.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:08.093 align:middle line:90%
And not Boulder, Colorado.

00:10:08.093 --> 00:10:09.300 align:middle line:90%
The boulder, big boulder.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: The boulders, OK.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.596 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Boulders.

00:10:11.596 --> 00:10:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, it started
about five years ago

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:19.120 align:middle line:90%
and I do a retreat every year.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.880 align:middle line:84%
This is our 34th
coming up this year

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.680 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to try to figure
out how to do it virtually.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, boy.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But anyway, I
walk a road every day,

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.590 align:middle line:90%
several times a day.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And one day I was walking down
this road with this friend

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.320 align:middle line:90%
of mine, Terry.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Terry, where did
these boulders come from?

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.080 align:middle line:90%
We were crossing a bridge.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.080 align:middle line:84%
There was a little stream that
goes under the bridge that

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.190 align:middle line:90%
meets a river.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And these boulders were huge,
like the size of automobiles.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And in my world as a shaman
or shamanic practitioner,

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.700 align:middle line:84%
I would greet these
boulders as grandmothers.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'd say
hello, gatekeepers

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:03.065 align:middle line:84%
of the stream and river
and that type of thing.

00:11:03.065 --> 00:11:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And so when I said
that to Terry,

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.270 align:middle line:84%
he's looking at
me like, Jan, what

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.900 align:middle line:84%
do you want, the geologic
explanation of how

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:09.970 align:middle line:90%
they got there?

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:11.100 align:middle line:90%
He's laughing.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And I realized how
goofy my question was.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.750 align:middle line:90%
But I had never noticed them.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And so every time we went by
for the next several years,

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.810 align:middle line:84%
and several times a
day, I would go out

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:24.420 align:middle line:84%
of my way in some sort
of animated thing,

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.810 align:middle line:84%
hello, you know,
nice to see you.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hello, grandmothers.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.575 align:middle line:90%
Grandmother boulders.

00:11:28.575 --> 00:11:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Some way to just like
really accent my acknowledging

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.740 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, then one year I'm
going along the road.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:38.490 align:middle line:90%
Terry wasn't there.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.530 align:middle line:84%
The first year he
had ever missed.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was there with
a friend, Colleen.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:90%
And we got to the same place.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at her and I said,
Colleen, where's the boulders?

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And she said, what
boulders, Jan?

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And I said, the
boulders that I have

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.080 align:middle line:84%
been greeting for the
last five years every time

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.910 align:middle line:90%
I walked by here.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:02.380 align:middle line:90%
There is no boulders here, Jan.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.445 align:middle line:90%
And right then I knew.

00:12:03.445 --> 00:12:07.270 align:middle line:84%
I knew that the spirits
were showing me something.

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:10.240 align:middle line:84%
They were catching my
attention in a big way.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.782 align:middle line:84%
Now, why I would think that
is because of my training.

00:12:12.782 --> 00:12:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Like discounting it
like, oh, man, that's weird.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:21.390 align:middle line:84%
I knew-- I knew that they
were showing us something.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And so that started
my study with it.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:26.003 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I contacted
Cynthia Sue about parallel--

00:12:26.003 --> 00:12:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I've
had Cynthia Sue

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.588 align:middle line:84%
on my show a couple of times
here talking about this,

00:12:30.588 --> 00:12:32.380 align:middle line:84%
because she's had very
similar experiences.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she, of
course, really focuses

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.070 align:middle line:90%
on the Mandela effect.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:36.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Which would
be a version of this.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:40.290 align:middle line:90%
So that year went by.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.960 align:middle line:84%
We did a lot of work
around it, realizing

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.143 align:middle line:84%
that you can intentionally step
into another parallel reality.

00:12:47.143 --> 00:12:48.060 align:middle line:90%
So we were practicing.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So let's-- so your
friend, Colleen,

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.385 align:middle line:84%
had she ever been past those
boulders in previous years?

00:12:55.385 --> 00:12:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Not that
she remembered.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.495 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So for you--

00:12:58.495 --> 00:13:00.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she-- had
she been on that walk

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.150 align:middle line:90%
before in previous years?

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.395 align:middle line:84%
So in her walk, there
were no boulders.

00:13:04.395 --> 00:13:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That she remembered.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In your walk each
year, there were boulders.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's right.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.310 align:middle line:90%
So I call those markers.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And so we have these
markers of what's the same

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and what's a little
different will tell you

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.610 align:middle line:84%
which reality you were in
at any particular moment.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:22.490 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to fast
forward another year.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.440 align:middle line:84%
So I have this story
I'm telling camp.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.755 align:middle line:84%
We've got, you know,
70 people in camp

00:13:26.755 --> 00:13:28.130 align:middle line:84%
that I'm telling
about this story

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:31.730 align:middle line:84%
and they're all
wide-eyed and excited.

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.260 align:middle line:90%
But it was still my experience.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was the only
one that had it.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:40.640 align:middle line:84%
So the following year, we
get back and more markers

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.380 align:middle line:90%
were given to the whole camp.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, several of these people
have been with me for years.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is like the big
thing to go to this retreat

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:49.820 align:middle line:90%
every summer.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And there is a prayer tent
that we have that's set up

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:56.630 align:middle line:84%
that's very large that will
house maybe 40 or 50 people

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:57.500 align:middle line:90%
under it.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's set between two trees.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.830 align:middle line:84%
So I had it custom made to
fit on this piece of land

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:08.160 align:middle line:84%
so that it would fit
between these two markers.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And then I sit in
the middle of that.

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And then there is a sacred fire
there and a sweat lodge here.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.760 align:middle line:84%
So I line my heart up with
going through the fire

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.570 align:middle line:84%
and going into the
lodge door, OK?

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:27.660 align:middle line:84%
We get to the land
and set up the tent,

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.270 align:middle line:90%
which can only go in one place.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I'm sitting over there.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And people are going, what
are you doing over there, Jan?

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm lined up
with the fire and the lodge.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So I was about six or
seven feet to the right.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So that's showing this
reality, this Earth is tilted--

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:51.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --off--

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.753 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --that much difference.

00:14:53.753 --> 00:14:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it still
appeared that way to you.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It appeared
that way to everybody.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knew
where I always sat.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:00.555 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:00.555 --> 00:15:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And that I was in
the middle of the prayer tent.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:03.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And now--
so that was a marker

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.920 align:middle line:84%
so that everybody could
have this experience.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Look at this marker and what
has shifted that you normally

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:13.110 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't noticed.

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:14.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: OK.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Then another one was when we're
walking down this one road

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and we're going out
to a particular area.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:25.440 align:middle line:84%
You have to climb over
this huge fir tree that

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.170 align:middle line:90%
had fallen years and years ago.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And we always have a person
standing there helping you,

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:35.880 align:middle line:84%
because you had to hoist
yourself up to get over it.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.730 align:middle line:90%
The tree's gone.

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:38.690 align:middle line:90%
The tree's gone.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:41.690 align:middle line:84%
There was no-- no
clumps of trees.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.270 align:middle line:90%
You know, the tree is huge.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:43.520 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.243 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --to take-- you could
not take it out of there.

00:15:46.243 --> 00:15:47.375 align:middle line:90%
There was no indication--

00:15:47.375 --> 00:15:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You would see wood
chips and destruction and lying

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.900 align:middle line:90%
underneath it, yeah.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Or even
pieces of wood--

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --rounds of wood.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Nothing.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.600 align:middle line:90%
It was like--

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's as though it had
never been disturbed and never

00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.702 align:middle line:90%
been there.

00:15:59.702 --> 00:16:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So that, to
me, was for the camp.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: They were-- it
wasn't my experience anymore.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:13.320 align:middle line:84%
But this is training for us
that it is important for us

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.640 align:middle line:84%
to notice and start
noticing these markers.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Because realities are
shifting all of the time.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's when you
start paying attention

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:30.700 align:middle line:84%
to that that you understand
its validity and its truth.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then if you
understand that, presumably,

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:37.030 align:middle line:84%
it's going to give you the
confidence when you're primed

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:40.810 align:middle line:84%
to shift a perception and
shift to physical reality,

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:44.110 align:middle line:84%
you already have markers, as
you say, and your view-- as you

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:46.525 align:middle line:84%
witness that you've already
seen this is possible.

00:16:46.525 --> 00:16:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's exactly right.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's kind of
confidence building in a way.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It is.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it's
that thing where when

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.330 align:middle line:84%
it's in your consciousness,
when you've obtained it

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.130 align:middle line:84%
in your consciousness,
that it then allows

00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:58.690 align:middle line:90%
you to see it more often.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:16:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:00.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:01.930 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if this
is the right time to do it

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:03.010 align:middle line:90%
or not but I want to.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.740 align:middle line:84%
2013 you sat with an
elder from a reservation,

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.930 align:middle line:90%
there was Sundance, the--

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:10.390 align:middle line:90%
asking the medicine men to--

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:13.540 align:middle line:84%
something about aligning with
the Stargate, as I recall.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what happened there.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.010 align:middle line:90%
That was post 2012.

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So in 2012, you know,
we had the unraveling

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:25.970 align:middle line:84%
of the bondage of humanity,
which was a really big deal.

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:30.250 align:middle line:84%
So in 2013, there was a
Stargate that was opening.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
elders that I know of

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:36.670 align:middle line:90%
were all excited about this.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turned out
that the Stargate

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:42.340 align:middle line:84%
was opening exactly when
I was having my retreat.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.530 align:middle line:84%
That was the week
that it was open.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:45.430 align:middle line:90%
You know, go figure.

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:48.116 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:48.116 --> 00:17:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So we very
much took this to heart,

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:55.420 align:middle line:90%
that this was divinely planned.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And I had a astrological
chart made up

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.650 align:middle line:84%
of the alignment of the
planets, and then had

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:06.730 align:middle line:84%
imbued different crystals,
and had everything set up

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:11.350 align:middle line:84%
on a two-dimensional platform
so that we could really

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:13.270 align:middle line:90%
honor this process.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:18.760 align:middle line:84%
And then ceremonially opened
that Stargate in my version--

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:22.200 align:middle line:90%
in our version of it.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of
the Stargate was

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:31.420 align:middle line:84%
that if we had a
unraveling or a dismantling

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:36.870 align:middle line:84%
of a particular paradigm, or
a particular way of being,

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:41.820 align:middle line:84%
let's say, 25,000 years of
bondage sort of thing, then

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:84%
what do you want the
next 25,000 years?

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:45.720 align:middle line:84%
If that's unraveled,
then what are you

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.700 align:middle line:90%
going to put into motion?

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And so we came up with
our own version of that,

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.800 align:middle line:84%
things that we felt
were important.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And we chose words
such as collaboration,

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.670 align:middle line:90%
unification, support, and love.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:07.860 align:middle line:84%
That those are the cornerstones
of how we would want humanity

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:09.300 align:middle line:90%
to be functioning.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And then threading through
that was non competition,

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.290 align:middle line:90%
or no competition.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And-- and so to
us, that was like,

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:22.620 align:middle line:84%
these words hold the
frequencies for the new Earth.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And the spirits have been
very, very clear with me

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.870 align:middle line:84%
from the very
beginning of my work

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.810 align:middle line:84%
that I was a carrier of
the new Earth energies.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I feel like all
of the things that I

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.740 align:middle line:84%
have done in my work have
been around that topic

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:43.212 align:middle line:90%
and in preparation for--

00:19:43.212 --> 00:19:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This time.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --this time.

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And even the parallel realities
that, you know, like, OK,

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:53.410 align:middle line:84%
there is the reality that
the new Earth already exists

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:54.730 align:middle line:90%
and then moving into it.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:57.033 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a lot of
people talk about this time

00:19:57.033 --> 00:19:58.450 align:middle line:84%
that we're in right
now because it

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:02.260 align:middle line:90%
is so challenging to so many.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Saying-- especially people who
have an intuitive sense or talk

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:08.710 align:middle line:84%
with their guides
that, yeah, we are--

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:11.890 align:middle line:84%
we have to choose the outcome
on this one, you know.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:15.093 align:middle line:84%
And that we can choose a
higher or a lower outcome.

00:20:15.093 --> 00:20:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And you watch
people and you start

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:18.190 align:middle line:84%
looking at the
amount of mass fear,

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:20.920 align:middle line:84%
for example, that's being
propagated by the media

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.000 align:middle line:84%
and frightening the
bejesus out of people.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Because we simply
don't know what is

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:27.990 align:middle line:84%
and what isn't true
around this whole thing.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:31.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the
pandemic, of course.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And so you-- then you listen
to someone like yourself,

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.770 align:middle line:90%
or I interviewed Carl Calleman.

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And Carl Calleman, from
the Mayan calendar,

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.680 align:middle line:84%
was talking about how this
ninth wave of consciousness

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.150 align:middle line:90%
is there for us to open up into.

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's exactly what
you talked about.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.400 align:middle line:84%
It's about unification
and collaboration,

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.390 align:middle line:84%
coming together as a
people, as a species,

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.130 align:middle line:84%
instead of competing
with each other.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And you hear this-- it
seems to be reflected

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:03.580 align:middle line:84%
through many different lenses,
more of an indigenous nature,

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.100 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, for sure,
the indigenous natures

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.470 align:middle line:84%
have been around for hundreds
of thousands of years.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And the newer ones have only
been around for about 50.

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, about 50.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.450 align:middle line:84%
But this notion that through
this crisis that we're in

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:19.148 align:middle line:84%
gives us the chance to
evolve into a more unity

00:21:19.148 --> 00:21:20.065 align:middle line:90%
type of consciousness.

00:21:20.065 --> 00:21:20.865 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:21:20.865 --> 00:21:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And another big aspect of
that that I didn't mention,

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.560 align:middle line:84%
but I think is
very important, is

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.370 align:middle line:84%
that it was the 2012
was also a dismantling

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:31.670 align:middle line:90%
of the outer authority--

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --and moving
into the inner authority.

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:42.010 align:middle line:10%
And inner authority means,
to me, an inner alignment

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:42.910 align:middle line:10%
within yourself.

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Not that you have this
power to force things.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:51.732 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But it's like the
idea and the concept which

00:21:51.732 --> 00:21:53.940 align:middle line:84%
has actually been around
since the beginning of time,

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.240 align:middle line:84%
too, that the universe
is inside of you.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And what is inside of you is
then reflected to the outside.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:03.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you see.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.820 align:middle line:84%
So when you want to
change the outside world,

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.820 align:middle line:84%
you have to change the
inside world first.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
primarily my work

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.083 align:middle line:90%
is today is helping people to--

00:22:13.083 --> 00:22:14.625 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Find their
inner authority.

00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Inner authority,
and find where they're un--

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:23.610 align:middle line:84%
suffering and unhappy so they
can align that and then change

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:24.705 align:middle line:90%
their outside world.

00:22:24.705 --> 00:22:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one of the things
you talked about was after this

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:28.890 align:middle line:90%
period, you came to realize--

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.170 align:middle line:84%
or I don't know if it
was expressly spoken--

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:36.080 align:middle line:84%
that strict methodology, for
example, was no longer needed.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.960 align:middle line:84%
I think that-- you know, I'm
a methods person, you know.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:44.370 align:middle line:84%
I have a science background and,
you know, the psychotherapy.

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:49.710 align:middle line:84%
But I think that we have to
move into an understanding

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:58.190 align:middle line:84%
of the magic, and that we are
the creators of our realities.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.080 align:middle line:90%
And can you prove this?

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.850 align:middle line:90%
Maybe, maybe not.

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:06.020 align:middle line:84%
But you have to move into
a greater concept, a higher

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:07.430 align:middle line:90%
level of consciousness.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:08.780 align:middle line:90%
That's what the new Earth is.

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.445 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It's a higher
level of consciousness.

00:23:10.445 --> 00:23:11.862 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
can be empirical.

00:23:11.862 --> 00:23:14.030 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
materialistically proven.

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:14.100 align:middle line:90%
It--

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Exactly.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:15.655 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:15.655 --> 00:23:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: One of the--

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.155 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we need
to disconnect from that

00:23:18.155 --> 00:23:20.810 align:middle line:84%
because the reality is--
the nature of reality

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.970 align:middle line:90%
is completely invisible forces.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:25.275 align:middle line:84%
Even if you were to look
at us on a quantum level,

00:23:25.275 --> 00:23:26.075 align:middle line:90%
we're invisible--

00:23:26.075 --> 00:23:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --right?

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think one of the
worst things that ever happened

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:35.300 align:middle line:84%
to humanity was that they
put science and mysticism

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.140 align:middle line:90%
against each other.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Scientific materialism
has a place.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.470 align:middle line:90%
But not an exclusion--

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:41.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --of the other.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, they
started competing.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And then that
handicapped both of them.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:46.585 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:23:46.585 --> 00:23:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And when
you can marry them

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:52.490 align:middle line:84%
without competing and
accepting both at the level

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:55.970 align:middle line:84%
that they're able to
explain, then you've

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:57.530 align:middle line:90%
got a lot of permission.

00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:01.370 align:middle line:84%
You have unlimited
possibilities.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:03.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you try to
prove everything,

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.510 align:middle line:84%
you're just
handicapping yourself.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the miracles
will prove it,

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:12.340 align:middle line:84%
what you'll see, what you'll
experience, what you'll feel.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I couldn't
agree with you more.

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's what-- in my opinion,
that's the beauty of this time.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.710 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why Gaia exists
is because people are now

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:23.680 align:middle line:84%
curious to begin marrying
those in their own psyche.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.177 align:middle line:84%
And also by way of
validating themselves, too.

00:24:26.177 --> 00:24:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:28.468 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
understanding they're

00:24:28.468 --> 00:24:32.080 align:middle line:84%
not crazy for going
with the spiritual path,

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.260 align:middle line:84%
for example, and finding
some scientific validity

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.880 align:middle line:84%
for having chosen
that to explain

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.900 align:middle line:90%
to families and friends.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's as simple as
trying to validate oneself.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.725 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in fact, to
be able to work with both

00:24:42.725 --> 00:24:44.470 align:middle line:90%
forces is truly powerful.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And, you know, Gaia
is a very high conscious.

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:51.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's a high frequency
and it's here to help,

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.100 align:middle line:84%
for sure, all the
programming that you guys do.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.660 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.780 align:middle line:84%
But quantum physics has
come into the picture,

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.480 align:middle line:90%
too, for that same reason.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And I just believe
that quantum physics is

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.080 align:middle line:90%
shamanism in the science field.

00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:05.955 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:05.955 --> 00:25:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I mean, what
they say, it's like, yep,

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.350 align:middle line:84%
we've been saying
this, you know,

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.062 align:middle line:90%
for many thousands of years.

00:25:13.062 --> 00:25:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:15.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now there's
just the language for it.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: There's
a language for it.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So one of the
other things that came up

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:22.030 align:middle line:84%
is that you realized that
time is being altered.

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And when you and I had one
conversation in the past,

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:29.050 align:middle line:84%
you were talking about how
time had to present itself

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:31.630 align:middle line:84%
the way it has in the
past, which is certainly

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:33.340 align:middle line:84%
the bane of most
people's existence

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.030 align:middle line:84%
is nothing seems to
happen fast enough.

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:35.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, explain
what's happening with time,

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:41.710 align:middle line:84%
and why through your lens,
it had to be that way.

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, time saves us.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.690 align:middle line:84%
People want instant
manifestation,

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:49.270 align:middle line:84%
but they don't realize
that that takes

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:52.750 align:middle line:90%
an extremely focused mind.

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Because they would literally
self-destruct within seconds.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:58.610 align:middle line:90%
Because one random thought--

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:01.210 align:middle line:84%
and if you had
instant manifestation,

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.495 align:middle line:84%
you would cause tremendous
harm, you know, just--

00:26:04.495 --> 00:26:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just in our
normal careless thoughts

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:07.300 align:middle line:90%
throughout the day.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.400 align:middle line:90%
And so-- exactly.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.200 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Our speech is sloppy, you know,
all kinds of different things.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And so the time has been
a real buffer for us

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:24.400 align:middle line:84%
so that it teaches us how to
focus if you practice this.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:28.330 align:middle line:84%
If you really want to manifest
and manifest what you want,

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.010 align:middle line:90%
instead of what you don't want.

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.158 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe people
are manifesting 24/7--

00:26:32.158 --> 00:26:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --you know,
it never stops.

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:36.310 align:middle line:90%
We're manifesting beings.

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:37.340 align:middle line:90%
We're creator beings.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:38.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:42.160 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: And-- but to
really fine tune that,

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.900 align:middle line:10%
to get it into
the level of where

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:49.900 align:middle line:10%
you want to go, then that
takes much focused intention.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And the more that you do
that, the faster things

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:58.350 align:middle line:84%
will happen because you
are in alignment with--

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.540 align:middle line:84%
there's a training
or a purification

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.480 align:middle line:84%
that happens inside of you
when you learn how to focus

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.310 align:middle line:90%
and to still your mind.

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And that-- I think
that that is part

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.930 align:middle line:84%
of the process where it shows
up then in the good things

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:11.730 align:middle line:90%
that you manifest.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.022 align:middle line:84%
Because you're really not
having the negative thoughts.

00:27:14.022 --> 00:27:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you were in
alignment with your soul's

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:21.060 align:middle line:84%
purpose, your soul's desire
and choice of expression

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:26.280 align:middle line:84%
in a given lifetime, it's
learning in a given lifetime,

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.390 align:middle line:84%
would you say then that is kind
of an anchor point with which

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:34.380 align:middle line:84%
to start using your focus
so that you can have kind

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.410 align:middle line:84%
of a cleaner process
of manifestation

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:39.930 align:middle line:84%
so that when time does
speed up and you do gain

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:42.460 align:middle line:84%
your will and your focus, you're
in alignment with something

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:43.260 align:middle line:90%
higher.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:46.750 align:middle line:84%
I would say that that
is a big part of it.

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:50.605 align:middle line:10%
The other thing that I think is
a major part is your feelings.

00:27:50.605 --> 00:27:51.405 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:51.405 --> 00:27:54.000 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: And--
because your feelings

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.970 align:middle line:10%
are the things that really
start the manifestation.

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:58.980 align:middle line:84%
So you can be in alignment
with your purpose

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:03.450 align:middle line:84%
and still have very
low frequency feelings

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:04.590 align:middle line:90%
that can get in your way.

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:07.410 align:middle line:84%
They can create all kinds of
obstacles and difficulties

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:10.230 align:middle line:90%
for you, and things like that.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Where when you start
broadcasting these higher

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:20.070 align:middle line:84%
frequencies, and then have
your intention of your purpose,

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:23.080 align:middle line:84%
that's when there is
magic that happens.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:23.880 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.985 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you say now
we're at a point in time

00:28:26.985 --> 00:28:28.860 align:middle line:84%
where if you can bring
these things together,

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:33.060 align:middle line:84%
we can far more--
with more certainty,

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.820 align:middle line:84%
begin manifesting
almost instantaneously.

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.100 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to begin doing
that now, if these things

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:39.900 align:middle line:90%
are in alignment.

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.740 align:middle line:10%
You have-- you can't be
in the doom and gloom--

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:42.910 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:43.395 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: --of everything.

00:28:43.395 --> 00:28:44.195 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:44.195 --> 00:28:48.090 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: You have to
be realizing that--

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:51.930 align:middle line:10%
I believe part of
this pandemic is

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:55.845 align:middle line:10%
life saying, go within,
go within your house,

00:28:55.845 --> 00:28:57.150 align:middle line:10%
but go within.

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:59.490 align:middle line:84%
This is time to quit
looking at the world

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.970 align:middle line:84%
and blaming the world, and
start looking to where you're

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.850 align:middle line:84%
out of alignment
inside and start

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.640 align:middle line:84%
registering these higher
frequency energies.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And if people have trouble with
that, one of the most easiest,

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:16.630 align:middle line:84%
to me, is to just
feel appreciation.

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:19.050 align:middle line:84%
If you can feel
appreciation, and that

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:23.710 align:middle line:84%
would be no matter what
is happening in your life,

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:26.650 align:middle line:84%
do you have more than
one pair of shoes?

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:29.080 align:middle line:90%
Do you have one more pot or pan?

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've traveled the
world, and a lot of people

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:32.900 align:middle line:90%
don't, you know.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And so you can find things to
appreciate and embody that.

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Not just thinking
about appreciation,

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:44.395 align:middle line:84%
but what does it feel
like to feel appreciation?

00:29:44.395 --> 00:29:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.335 align:middle line:90%
That's the real juice.

00:29:47.335 --> 00:29:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That is the juice.

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.360 align:middle line:90%
That is the key.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like
the magnetic power

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.950 align:middle line:84%
that allows something to
come into a physically

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:55.060 align:middle line:90%
manifested state.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.570 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't agree more.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:59.080 align:middle line:84%
I think you can call it
appreciation or gratitude,

00:29:59.080 --> 00:29:59.880 align:middle line:90%
either one.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is a
really high frequency.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes, very high.

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
people often think--

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.710 align:middle line:84%
I believe many people think
they have to become a master--

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:10.510 align:middle line:90%
masterful.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Do this, this number of times
for this number of weeks

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:15.040 align:middle line:84%
or months or years, and
you can start reaching

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.720 align:middle line:90%
into these high frequencies.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.260 align:middle line:84%
No, you can sit down and raise
your frequencies on a dime

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:24.610 align:middle line:84%
by just really appreciating
something wonderful

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:26.790 align:middle line:90%
in your life, or someone.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:29.993 align:middle line:84%
Your frequencies just
shoot through the roof.

00:30:29.993 --> 00:30:31.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think in
heart math, you know,

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.728 align:middle line:84%
they've been able to register
what happens when you do this.

00:30:34.728 --> 00:30:35.770 align:middle line:90%
So I couldn't agree more.

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.960 align:middle line:84%
This is the simplest path
to raising frequencies.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.837 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about
what you're saying.

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Like the spirits will always
say, you can't trick energy.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:43.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:43.570 align:middle line:90%
You have to feel it.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You can't say one
thing and feel another.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So people will say,
but I was doing my affirmations

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.140 align:middle line:90%
and I was doing this.

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.348 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what do you feel?

00:30:51.348 --> 00:30:52.370 align:middle line:90%
Frustrated.

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:52.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.130 align:middle line:90%
That's what you got.

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:55.338 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's what you got.

00:30:55.338 --> 00:30:56.890 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's like you--

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:59.712 align:middle line:84%
it's not about what you
say, it's what you feel.

00:30:59.712 --> 00:31:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's what
you feel, yeah.

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And learning how
to really embody that.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And they have done
enough studies now

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.800 align:middle line:84%
that they're saying,
you know, that that's

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.830 align:middle line:84%
what the matrix, that
invisible web that

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:16.370 align:middle line:84%
is connecting all things, is
actually made out of emotion.

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:19.055 align:middle line:90%
It's an emotional frequency.

00:31:19.055 --> 00:31:21.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And a lot of people--

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:24.140 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people,
I think, have yet

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.960 align:middle line:84%
to distinguish or know how
to distinguish emotions

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:27.760 align:middle line:90%
from feelings, too.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because there
is a subtle difference

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:31.430 align:middle line:90%
there that does matter.

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:33.847 align:middle line:84%
And maybe explain that since
we're talking about emotions.

00:31:33.847 --> 00:31:35.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Well, I know--

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:38.497 align:middle line:84%
I know that you are an advocate
for the mattering and to me,

00:31:38.497 --> 00:31:39.580 align:middle line:90%
for the novice it's like--

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They don't matter.

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:40.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --they don't matter.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.600 align:middle line:84%
It's just like we don't need
to split that hair, you know.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.310 align:middle line:90%
It's just like, let's--

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:46.540 align:middle line:90%
if we can get you into this--

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just getting
into the good feelings.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.193 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:31:50.193 --> 00:31:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And so you're talking about
getting into those-- getting

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:58.180 align:middle line:84%
into that space allows us to
reach a type of vibration that

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.850 align:middle line:84%
allows us then in a
responsible manner

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:03.280 align:middle line:84%
to begin bringing our
thoughts and ideas

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.560 align:middle line:84%
and our will together
to begin manifesting

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:09.365 align:middle line:84%
this new, more unified reality
that we're talking about.

00:32:09.365 --> 00:32:10.990 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when
you have something

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:14.140 align:middle line:84%
like this COVID thing
that hits the planet,

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:18.160 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of conflicting
information out there?

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And people are afraid for
the lives of their loved

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:22.180 align:middle line:90%
ones and their own lives.

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is permeating the
field of consciousness.

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The spirits told
me one year in a meditation,

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:34.930 align:middle line:84%
they said, every person
born has the full capacity

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:38.540 align:middle line:84%
to change the world
single-handedly.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.210 align:middle line:84%
When they said that,
I thought now, how--

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:42.650 align:middle line:90%
how is that possible?

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:45.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, like not everybody
wants to be an activist.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody wants to go
out there and, you know,

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:50.540 align:middle line:90%
raise a banner and--

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --be on
the front lines.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.100 align:middle line:84%
But what I realized right
then is what we've been

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.740 align:middle line:90%
talking about, everybody feels.

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And so it doesn't matter how
much it's in the collective.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.120 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what's out there.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:09.350 align:middle line:84%
What matters is what's in
here and what you attune to.

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:14.810 align:middle line:84%
When you attune to those higher
frequencies, then you're there.

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And the world will
seem different to you.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I was
going to say a moment ago,

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.030 align:middle line:84%
not playing devil's
advocate, just

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:23.780 align:middle line:84%
looking at it in this
way, when they said,

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.960 align:middle line:84%
every human being has the
power to change the world

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.280 align:middle line:90%
within them.

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, your world and your
reality is your creation.

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So you're certainly
changing your world.

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Does that by extension
mean that it's

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:39.645 align:middle line:90%
changing the world of others?

00:33:39.645 --> 00:33:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Abso-- well, it means
if you look at it from parallel

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:43.310 align:middle line:90%
realities--

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, let's.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --and that everybody's
in their own parallel reality--

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --then in my parallel
reality, I would include you,

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Regina.

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:54.913 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You know, and I would
include all those people.

00:33:54.913 --> 00:33:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- I am having
this personal experience

00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:04.730 align:middle line:84%
of my reality, which is
beautiful and I love it.

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And so if you want to look
at changing a collective,

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:12.580 align:middle line:84%
I think when enough people
are doing that, then, yes, we

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.800 align:middle line:90%
will have a collective shift.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Do I think that you
can have this shift

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.100 align:middle line:90%
before that's happening?

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:19.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:19.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.699 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I think you
can have it personally,

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:22.779 align:middle line:84%
and you can have
it collectively.

00:34:22.779 --> 00:34:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And we do know that our
thoughts do an imprint

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:28.250 align:middle line:84%
on the field around
us and at large.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:31.449 align:middle line:84%
And the end-- that in the
greater field, we are unified.

00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, if we have a
preponderance of thought forms,

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:39.489 align:middle line:84%
of feelings, that can see this
unity consciousness beginning

00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:42.830 align:middle line:84%
to happen, we're going to start
magnetizing others toward that.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:44.922 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I mean, that is true.

00:34:44.922 --> 00:34:47.450 align:middle line:84%
So I want to go into another
one of your quirky experiences.

00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:48.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:49.375 align:middle line:90%
Let me look where this was.

00:34:49.375 --> 00:34:50.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.659 align:middle line:84%
This one is kind of
fun because we're

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:56.739 align:middle line:84%
talking about using our
frequencies to essentially

00:34:56.739 --> 00:34:59.740 align:middle line:84%
raise the vibration
of the planet, right?

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:02.950 align:middle line:84%
This is a story that
you had a gathering out

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:05.830 align:middle line:90%
on the land in Tillamook, OK?

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And you had arrived, and there
was something just devastating

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:09.610 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:11.712 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So I love your story.

00:35:11.712 --> 00:35:13.442 align:middle line:84%
So let's go on,
because this is part

00:35:13.442 --> 00:35:15.400 align:middle line:84%
of what we're talking
about about consciousness

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.233 align:middle line:90%
affecting the whole.

00:35:16.233 --> 00:35:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: It-- it is actually a
great story to kind of refine

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.360 align:middle line:90%
this whole thing.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: So again,
I do this retreat,

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.910 align:middle line:84%
and I usually
arrive a couple days

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:31.390 align:middle line:84%
before people start coming
so I can work with the land

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:34.690 align:middle line:84%
and I can have a
shamanic practice.

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:35.630 align:middle line:90%
I do all those things.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:37.130 align:middle line:84%
I go out and talk
to the trees and--

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --you know, go out and
do all these different things.

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I arrived,
right across the river

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:46.050 align:middle line:84%
there was a clear
cutting going on.

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:47.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:52.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, the saws and the
crashing trees and the beeping

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:53.340 align:middle line:90%
trucks.

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:55.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was horrible.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what
am I going to do?

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:02.140 align:middle line:84%
I have, you know,
70, 80 people that I

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:03.620 align:middle line:90%
would classify as tree huggers.

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That could put them
into an absolute tailspin--

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:08.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --with this.

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:10.165 align:middle line:90%
Talk about bringing up emotions.

00:36:10.165 --> 00:36:11.285 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:11.285 --> 00:36:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And so I had these
visions of myself, you know.

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:16.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to march over
there and just tell them.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And I could see myself like
and they're like, lady, get out

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:20.650 align:middle line:90%
of here, you know.

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:21.035 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:21.035 --> 00:36:22.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: So I sat down to pray.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK, what
am I going to do here?

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And I go into this prayer,
and the spirit said,

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:29.745 align:middle line:90%
you know exactly what to do.

00:36:29.745 --> 00:36:31.085 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, I do?

00:36:31.085 --> 00:36:31.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if I do.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Remind me.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Remind me.

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:33.773 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm upset.

00:36:33.773 --> 00:36:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And they
said, figure it out.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I was like, oh, gees,
figure it out, you know.

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.540 align:middle line:90%
And they did it lovingly.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.640 align:middle line:84%
My spirits are
always very loving.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that this wasn't
a criticism by any means.

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:49.990 align:middle line:84%
But they were making
me own my stuff.

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:51.430 align:middle line:90%
So I have CDs.

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:54.167 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of guided
meditations for people

00:36:54.167 --> 00:36:55.750 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of various
things like that.

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:57.625 align:middle line:84%
So I pulled out one of
them, and it's called,

00:36:57.625 --> 00:36:59.630 align:middle line:90%
"Dream a New Dream."

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Because my intention
was, my new dream,

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:05.445 align:middle line:84%
my new reality that I wanted
was that this clear cutting

00:37:05.445 --> 00:37:06.245 align:middle line:90%
was over.

00:37:06.245 --> 00:37:07.045 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:07.045 --> 00:37:09.647 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: That my
practicum, my retreat

00:37:09.647 --> 00:37:10.730 align:middle line:90%
was going to be beautiful.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:11.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And so I
started doing this,

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:18.830 align:middle line:84%
and I went through the process
of the suggestions on the CD.

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing you know,
I'm feeling this love for wood.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.640 align:middle line:90%
I love wood products.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:31.080 align:middle line:84%
I love decking, and I love
wood floors and homes and paper

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:31.880 align:middle line:90%
products, you know.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Just all these beautiful
things that wood gives us.

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Appreciation, again.

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:39.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Appreciation, yes.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And then I was thinking
about the people

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:44.240 align:middle line:84%
that are over there working and
how they're bringing a paycheck

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.550 align:middle line:84%
home, and they're putting
shoes on their kids' feet,

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and they're putting food on
the table, and it's a hard job,

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and they're working
hard for their families.

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And so again, I'm in
this appreciation.

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:59.900 align:middle line:84%
So by the time I came
out of this journey,

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:04.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm just like floating around
and I'm journey into the saws,

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:08.600 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just in this
little bubble of glow.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.010 align:middle line:90%
So the next day the people--

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:12.140 align:middle line:84%
some of the people
start arriving.

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:15.968 align:middle line:84%
And we have-- we have a thing
called, The Good Message,

00:38:15.968 --> 00:38:17.510 align:middle line:84%
what is the good
message for the day.

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And so as the people
were coming in,

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:23.330 align:middle line:84%
the good message was is
to honor this process

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:26.100 align:middle line:84%
and be in appreciation
for what's going on.

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:26.930 align:middle line:90%
And everybody did.

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:30.110 align:middle line:84%
I was so amazed, like I didn't
have a balk out of any of it.

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:33.110 align:middle line:84%
So it was still going
on that next day.

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:34.850 align:middle line:84%
The third day when
we were finally

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:39.170 align:middle line:84%
ready to start the ceremony, I
got up to call in the spirits

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:40.880 align:middle line:90%
and I started whistling.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I
started whistling,

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.390 align:middle line:90%
everything turned off.

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:45.590 align:middle line:90%
The trucks turned off.

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:47.810 align:middle line:90%
The saws turned off.

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:50.210 align:middle line:90%
They left the camp.

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:51.010 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:53.780 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh, my god.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:56.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, where I'd-- we're all
kind of staring at each other.

00:38:56.630 --> 00:39:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Later on when I had a
moment to quiet myself

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:04.567 align:middle line:84%
and to ask the spirit,
you know, what happened?

00:39:04.567 --> 00:39:05.650 align:middle line:90%
What really happened here?

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:07.480 align:middle line:90%
Explain this to me.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you became the
frequency of what you wanted.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.620 align:middle line:84%
When you become the
frequency of what you want,

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:19.902 align:middle line:84%
that's a direct match,
instantly manifests.

00:39:19.902 --> 00:39:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you had
had enough experience

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.857 align:middle line:84%
to understand these
things happen.

00:39:23.857 --> 00:39:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is part of
the matrix of your reality.

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:30.062 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people would say,
they would-- the frus--

00:39:30.062 --> 00:39:32.145 align:middle line:84%
they wouldn't be able to
overcome the frustration.

00:39:32.145 --> 00:39:33.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thinking
this is impossible,

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.570 align:middle line:90%
they have to stay on schedule.

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:38.370 align:middle line:84%
They've got money
to make, you know.

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:40.740 align:middle line:90%
This thing is bigger than me.

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:44.880 align:middle line:84%
But we have to
suspend our disbelief

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.380 align:middle line:90%
in working with this notion--

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that
you're talking about.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: This is
the critical time.

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: This is what we're
being asked to do, to go within

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:59.730 align:middle line:84%
and to really find what
do you believe about life?

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:01.770 align:middle line:84%
What do you believe
about spirit?

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:04.860 align:middle line:84%
What do you believe
about your connection?

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.380 align:middle line:90%
What do you believe about love?

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And you need to
take a bright light

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:11.130 align:middle line:84%
and shine it on those
beliefs, because they're

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:13.380 align:middle line:90%
running the show for you.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.777 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
talking about aligning.

00:40:15.777 --> 00:40:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is a course
that I'm teaching right

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:18.660 align:middle line:90%
now called, Recreate.

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:20.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like how do you
recreate yourself.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to find what's
running the show for you.

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:29.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you decide to be in fear,
then that's your given right.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.800 align:middle line:90%
You get to.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, you have
the right to choose.

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.720 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to be a match
for what I believe the bigger

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:41.350 align:middle line:84%
picture is that's going on, then
you have the tools to do that.

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:42.840 align:middle line:90%
We can get you in alignment.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And again, there are
a couple of things-- principles.

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:46.740 align:middle line:90%
First, do no harm.

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:49.117 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, what you're
going to create, do no harm.

00:40:49.117 --> 00:40:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Do no harm.

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:50.825 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do no harm.

00:40:50.825 --> 00:40:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And beyond that,
you're free to create

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:55.408 align:middle line:84%
if it's in this higher
alignment with the good.

00:40:55.408 --> 00:40:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, you're on--
you're doing it inside

00:40:57.450 --> 00:40:57.990 align:middle line:90%
of yourself.

00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:59.920 align:middle line:84%
You're not doing
anything to anybody else.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:00.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:01.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: You are aligning--

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:06.800 align:middle line:84%
when you align your inner
world, your outer world changes.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean you're
changing the outer world.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.680 align:middle line:90%
Your outer world changes.

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:14.160 align:middle line:84%
It is a personal
reality that you see.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:19.470 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
bringing this together.

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:21.340 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
some of the principles.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked about
even as an entree

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.380 align:middle line:84%
to it, using gratitude
or appreciation.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.780 align:middle line:84%
But the feelings that
drive it, something

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:29.310 align:middle line:90%
you're just so grateful for us.

00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And now you've lifted
your frequencies up.

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we're in meditation,
that's pretty easy to do.

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yes.

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then you get out of
your little meditation chair.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:40.590 align:middle line:84%
You go back into your
living room, or the kitchen,

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:42.840 align:middle line:84%
where maybe your
son and daughter

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.070 align:middle line:90%
are in a fight and whatnot.

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:48.990 align:middle line:84%
How do people keep their
vibratory frequencies high?

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:50.350 align:middle line:90%
This is the big conundrum.

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:51.210 align:middle line:90%
You can find it.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:52.350 align:middle line:90%
You can do it.

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:56.760 align:middle line:84%
But really trying to sustain
those higher frequency feelings

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:57.945 align:middle line:90%
is challenging for people.

00:41:57.945 --> 00:41:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.750 align:middle line:90%
And it is training.

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:02.430 align:middle line:90%
It is training yourself.

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because this retreat

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:06.600 align:middle line:84%
that I'm talking about
over and over again,

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.810 align:middle line:84%
we've decided that we're
going to move virtual.

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, how you do this
kind of retreat virtual,

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:17.042 align:middle line:84%
because there are
so many distractions

00:42:17.042 --> 00:42:18.250 align:middle line:90%
when you're doing it virtual.

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:20.190 align:middle line:84%
Because we're
sequestered on this land.

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:24.130 align:middle line:84%
It's like with a lot of
people that go to conferences,

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:26.110 align:middle line:84%
you come out of bliss
bunny, then you go home.

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:26.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's--

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:28.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
everything changes.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.042 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And the spirits
have said over and over,

00:42:30.042 --> 00:42:32.200 align:middle line:84%
you have a perfect
microcosm of the new Earth

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.430 align:middle line:90%
when you're there.

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:35.230 align:middle line:84%
But now, how do you
have it at home?

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:37.840 align:middle line:90%
You lose it when you go home.

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:40.420 align:middle line:90%
So exactly what--

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:43.660 align:middle line:84%
I feel like we're the
template that we work

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:45.550 align:middle line:90%
on these things for people.

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And that how do you
find that type of focus

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:53.500 align:middle line:84%
and that type of
ability to not be

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:56.710 align:middle line:84%
distracted when
you've got kids, when

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:59.410 align:middle line:84%
you've got things
going on in your house,

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:01.633 align:middle line:84%
when you've got
meals, all of that.

00:43:01.633 --> 00:43:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we're
going to be working on.

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:06.790 align:middle line:90%
Because it is the answer.

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And it is taking, again,
that focus off the outside

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:12.680 align:middle line:84%
and what are you
going to do about it?

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.800 align:middle line:90%
How are you going to do it?

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.050 align:middle line:90%
For me, a simple--

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:19.630 align:middle line:84%
when I can feel
blue, or when I'm

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:24.260 align:middle line:84%
feeling upset about
something, very

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:26.810 align:middle line:84%
simply to raise my
vibration, I try

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:29.710 align:middle line:84%
to say as many high frequency
words as I can think of.

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And this is good.

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:34.585 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You know, beauty,
wonder, stellar, magnificent.

00:43:34.585 --> 00:43:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just as we hear
them, I'm listening to you,

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.380 align:middle line:90%
it automatically--

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:41.152 align:middle line:84%
the connotations bring
your feelings higher.

00:43:41.152 --> 00:43:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yeah, because they
are actually frequencies.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Those words
are frequencies.

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And they're having an effect
on your overall frequency.

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And it only takes 16 seconds
to change your frequency.

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:53.520 align:middle line:90%
Not very long.

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
I do in a pinch.

00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:59.570 align:middle line:84%
I do it as soon as
I get into my car

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:02.510 align:middle line:84%
before I take off and
drive so that I just

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:06.370 align:middle line:84%
have really great experiences
while I'm driving.

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:07.960 align:middle line:90%
And I'm-- I've trained myself.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, we--
we can't be blaming.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.920 align:middle line:84%
We can't be putting it off
on somebody else anymore.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:21.390 align:middle line:84%
We've got to say the
intention, I want to do this.

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:23.920 align:middle line:90%
And then give me the tools.

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And that's-- there's a
lot of people that supply tools

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:28.560 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:31.080 align:middle line:84%
I supply tools out
there, can teach you

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:34.748 align:middle line:84%
how to do this if you just
understand the laws of energy.

00:44:34.748 --> 00:44:36.165 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
learn shamanism.

00:44:36.165 --> 00:44:37.095 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:37.095 --> 00:44:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: You just have to
understand how energy works,

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:43.310 align:middle line:84%
because it's an energetic
universe, period.

00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:44.110 align:middle line:90%
It's binary.

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:45.460 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: It's a 01.

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:48.090 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's like a computer.

00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:50.175 align:middle line:84%
It's a high frequency,
or it's a low frequency--

00:44:50.175 --> 00:44:50.975 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:50.975 --> 00:44:52.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --one of the two.

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever one you're
feeding in your feelings,

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:58.050 align:middle line:90%
you will be attuned to.

00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:00.255 align:middle line:90%
You will be in alignment with.

00:45:00.255 --> 00:45:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:03.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, one
thing you say, too,

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:07.140 align:middle line:84%
is during this period of time
is we need to kind of stay away

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.240 align:middle line:84%
from the ego battles,
too, when we're talking

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.160 align:middle line:90%
about disrupting our fields.

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And right now, because of the
fracture in belief systems,

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:20.420 align:middle line:84%
which is very, very
steep and severe now,

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:22.770 align:middle line:84%
to the point where a
lot of family members

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:27.370 align:middle line:84%
can't even talk in a civil
way to one-- with one another.

00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:31.230 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that notion that we

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:33.330 align:middle line:84%
have to get out of
this ego position

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:36.270 align:middle line:84%
and we have to stop doing
battle in terms of keeping

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:37.710 align:middle line:90%
our frequencies high.

00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:40.450 align:middle line:84%
But also, in terms of
helping with the whole.

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:45.020 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
I find with people

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:49.340 align:middle line:84%
is that they feel like they
have to prove something, or get

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:51.230 align:middle line:84%
somebody else to believe
the same way they

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:57.020 align:middle line:84%
do to be either validated and/or
understood, or proven a point.

00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's
looking to the outside.

00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:02.840 align:middle line:84%
You do what you do
because it feels good,

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:08.540 align:middle line:84%
because you're living in
alignment to what you believe

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:10.610 align:middle line:90%
in and what you want to attain.

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:12.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't ever have
to speak a word.

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:14.060 align:middle line:90%
You can just be there.

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:16.310 align:middle line:90%
And I'll tell you, presence--

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:19.040 align:middle line:84%
presence of being around
somebody like that

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:21.750 align:middle line:84%
speaks a whole lot
louder than words do--

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:22.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --you know.

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:26.810 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to try
to prove something,

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:29.390 align:middle line:84%
like you're saying
an ego type of thing,

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:31.370 align:middle line:84%
you can sink your
ship pretty fast.

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:32.720 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to heal anybody.

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.090 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to fix anybody.

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:37.070 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has their own path.

00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you're choosing
yours, you're choosing yours.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's so true.

00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I've
noticed with myself

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:46.070 align:middle line:84%
we're getting into a
position, like getting firm

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:50.450 align:middle line:84%
on a position about something
and being faced with someone

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:53.240 align:middle line:84%
diametrically opposed,
where I'm thinking

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:55.220 align:middle line:90%
but where's your logic, right?

00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:59.360 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm finding is if
I do that, my field becomes

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.880 align:middle line:90%
depleted really rapidly now.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:02.780 align:middle line:90%
I mean, literally.

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:06.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like all the energy is
sucked right out of my body

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:09.890 align:middle line:84%
by going into that
state of egoic conflict.

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:12.125 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, you're
attuning to their level.

00:47:12.125 --> 00:47:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Whatever it is,
all the energy is gone.

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:18.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm finding it's just too
painful to engage in it.

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:19.520 align:middle line:90%
Not that I'm over it yet.

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:19.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:21.770 align:middle line:90%
We get-- we have our hooks.

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:22.850 align:middle line:90%
We have our hooks.

00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
we have our hooks.

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:25.075 align:middle line:84%
You look at me in a
certain way, I'll--

00:47:25.075 --> 00:47:26.420 align:middle line:90%
I'll, you know, put up my dukes.

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:27.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah, exactly.

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:29.160 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:33.710 align:middle line:84%
A concept in shamanism that
I pay a lot of attention to

00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:35.930 align:middle line:90%
is the power of invoking.

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:38.990 align:middle line:84%
So we invoke, have
invocations for the spirits

00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:40.760 align:middle line:90%
and for ceremony and things.

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:44.720 align:middle line:84%
But invocation also happens
in thought or speech.

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Like if we're sitting here
talking about positive things,

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:49.970 align:middle line:84%
we're invoking really
high frequency energies

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:51.290 align:middle line:90%
to be around us.

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:53.840 align:middle line:84%
Where if we were to talk
about the low stuff,

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:55.880 align:middle line:84%
the doom and the
gloom, the anti,

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:58.940 align:middle line:84%
the things that are against
us, you know, all that's--

00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:01.130 align:middle line:90%
we're going to invoke that, too.

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And so you pay attention
to where you are thinking

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:10.010 align:middle line:84%
and what you are thinking
and what you are feeling,

00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:14.270 align:middle line:84%
and if you decide to go on
a path with somebody else.

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And my rule of thumb is,
people don't get my joy,

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:20.750 align:middle line:90%
you know, like--

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:24.520 align:middle line:84%
I am not going to let
that go very easily.

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And that would happen if they're
really pushing my buttons.

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.830 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:31.990 align:middle line:90%
No, that's a good way to put it.

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:36.250 align:middle line:84%
So this really requires
to take a pause,

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:41.080 align:middle line:90%
to not let that hook come in.

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
people really fall down

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:47.180 align:middle line:84%
is not taking that pause and we
immediately go into reaction.

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is basic cognitive
stuff, basic psychology.

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:53.702 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, it has
a very profound effect

00:48:53.702 --> 00:48:55.660 align:middle line:84%
on our frequencies, which
they don't talk about

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:57.890 align:middle line:90%
in standard psychology classes.

00:48:57.890 --> 00:49:01.600 align:middle line:84%
So what do you personally
employ to not let

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:05.230 align:middle line:84%
that joy be stolen, to not let
that hook go in enough to where

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:06.235 align:middle line:90%
you bite?

00:49:06.235 --> 00:49:09.115 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, not that I'm
perfect at it, let me tell you.

00:49:09.115 --> 00:49:10.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know I'm not.

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And our families
will be some of our biggest--

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: --hookers, if
you want to call it that.

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:22.180 align:middle line:84%
However, I also
believe that we come

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:26.980 align:middle line:84%
in with goals in our lives,
with purposes, with things

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:29.310 align:middle line:90%
that we wish to attain as--

00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:34.170 align:middle line:84%
in our-- in our inner
akasha, so to speak.

00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's people that are
very interested in improving

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:39.150 align:middle line:90%
and being better.

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:43.480 align:middle line:84%
They're tired of the lack
of happiness or suffering

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:45.750 align:middle line:90%
and they want self-improvement.

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that when we
have family members that

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:52.170 align:middle line:84%
are egging this on,
it's not to look at them

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and what they're
doing, it's to look

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:55.320 align:middle line:90%
at what it brings up in us.

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:56.120 --> 00:50:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Because that is
a little clue about where

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:02.250 align:middle line:90%
you need to pay attention.

00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Because often, that aggravation
or that frustration, or anger,

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:11.190 align:middle line:84%
or hatred even that can
come up, is really a place

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:17.130 align:middle line:84%
that you're feeling vulnerable,
undervalued, not worthy--

00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Judged.

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:19.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: --judged.

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:24.450 align:middle line:84%
All these places within
you that are painful.

00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually what you
need to do the healings around.

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that, we don't
need that antagonism anymore.

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And again, things I think
will shift that outside world.

00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:40.250 align:middle line:90%
They're the outside world.

00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I agree.

00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:44.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really, this time, it
brings to us the possibility

00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:46.730 align:middle line:84%
to be still long
enough to really start

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:48.680 align:middle line:84%
working on our
spiritual maturity,

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and our emotional maturity,
and our mental maturity.

00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We need to grow up.

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:56.255 align:middle line:90%
As a species, we need to mature.

00:50:56.255 --> 00:50:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: We need to
ascend and mature.

00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I call it mature.

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:02.780 align:middle line:84%
That's part of
that path is that--

00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The Earth is ascending,
and we're going with her.

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And we either match it, or we're
pretty miserable, you know.

00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:11.398 align:middle line:84%
We're just-- we're in
the doldrums with it.

00:51:11.398 --> 00:51:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to take it
a step further now-- this--

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:14.490 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Get us out on a
controversial limb here.

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And that is that the Earth has
her frequencies, and she is--

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:24.930 align:middle line:84%
the Earth has her frequencies
and she is transcending,

00:51:24.930 --> 00:51:25.730 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:27.215 align:middle line:84%
And she's raising
her vibrations.

00:51:27.215 --> 00:51:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:29.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the
process of the Earth

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:31.450 align:middle line:84%
has been going through
for quite a long time now.

00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We and everything
that lives, every living

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.410 align:middle line:84%
system on the Earth, has
to match those frequencies

00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:38.630 align:middle line:84%
or you simply can't
stay with the Earth.

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:40.550 align:middle line:84%
So I say it's a matter
of whether we choose

00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:42.680 align:middle line:84%
to continue incarnating
on this planet

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:45.260 align:middle line:84%
and among the players
in our lives or not.

00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:48.947 align:middle line:84%
Because one theory is, if you
cannot match that frequency,

00:51:48.947 --> 00:51:50.780 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
to incarnate elsewhere.

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people might
say about now, great.

00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:54.310 align:middle line:90%
I'll go anywhere.

00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And I say, well, watch
what you wish for.

00:51:57.890 --> 00:52:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Because you're going to be
going into a similar frequency

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.540 align:middle line:84%
that you're trying
to escape from.

00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:03.870 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's very--

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:06.710 align:middle line:84%
I think it's critical, if you're
an earthling, a human being who

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:10.160 align:middle line:84%
has come here to do this
dance and to learn to refine

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:14.690 align:middle line:84%
ourselves on all levels, this is
a golden opportunity begging us

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:17.270 align:middle line:90%
to grow up and to advance our--

00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:19.790 align:middle line:84%
our frequencies, to
refine our frequencies.

00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:21.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And I hold a little bit
of a different belief

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:25.760 align:middle line:90%
around the Earth.

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:30.200 align:middle line:84%
I see that the Earth is an
extremely advanced place,

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:36.420 align:middle line:84%
because you're dealing with
mental, physical, emotional,

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual energy
systems, where

00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:41.603 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the intergalactic
beings are not.

00:52:41.603 --> 00:52:42.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're not.

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:43.670 align:middle line:84%
They don't have that
dimension that we have.

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:45.628 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Yes, they don't
have those dimensions.

00:52:45.628 --> 00:52:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And so we come here for
extremely advanced lessons.

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:54.545 align:middle line:84%
Like I always say, calculus is
a lot harder than arithmetic.

00:52:54.545 --> 00:52:55.415 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:55.415 --> 00:53:02.718 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And-- but we also
are under the, I guess, rule,

00:53:02.718 --> 00:53:04.510 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, that you
don't get to remember

00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:07.510 align:middle line:84%
because that's-- if you
remembered, it'd be very easy.

00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:11.780 align:middle line:84%
You have a knowingness
of where to go.

00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And so again, I see
this as we've signed up

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:16.555 align:middle line:90%
for some really advanced work.

00:53:16.555 --> 00:53:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with you.

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:18.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: And let's do it.

00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:20.430 align:middle line:90%
And let's do it.

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:22.360 align:middle line:84%
We've just been given
a golden opportunity

00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:25.690 align:middle line:84%
of a little bit of quiet, and
we have a lot of change coming.

00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:30.570 align:middle line:84%
The way the world looked
before January of 2020

00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:33.310 align:middle line:84%
will look a little different
now from this point forward.

00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And we get to create how
beautiful it is or isn't.

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Right.

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:38.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you're helping
people with this to recreate.

00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:40.753 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk about
that for a few minutes

00:53:40.753 --> 00:53:41.830 align:middle line:90%
before we sign off here.

00:53:41.830 --> 00:53:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Sure.

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, my school that I have
is called "Light Song,"

00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and I've been mostly
in shamanism, you know,

00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:54.990 align:middle line:90%
it's a shamanic-based school.

00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:59.130 align:middle line:84%
But I decided to take all the
shamanic stuff that I know

00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:04.860 align:middle line:84%
and start putting it into a
more lay language, you know,

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:05.670 align:middle line:90%
understanding.

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:07.365 align:middle line:84%
Because not everybody
wants to learn shamanism.

00:54:07.365 --> 00:54:08.165 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:08.165 --> 00:54:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: But shamanism
explains, at least to me,

00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:15.150 align:middle line:84%
and has defined it for
me, on how energy works

00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and how things are
created, how we

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:21.120 align:middle line:84%
interact with the
non-physical beings, all

00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:22.970 align:middle line:90%
this different stuff.

00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And how to find that
center inside of yourself.

00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So I designed to
recreate for anybody

00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:34.340 align:middle line:84%
to give the basic tools of
how to work with energy,

00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:36.830 align:middle line:90%
and how to do that inner work.

00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Like let's go down and see
what's going on inside.

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:42.515 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In there and
start lifting the game.

00:54:42.515 --> 00:54:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: I say--
I call it, putting

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.400 align:middle line:84%
a flashlight on those
elusive beliefs that

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:47.480 align:middle line:90%
are hidden under there.

00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: The spirits
call them blind beliefs,

00:54:49.850 --> 00:54:51.390 align:middle line:90%
that we have them.

00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:53.592 align:middle line:84%
We don't know-- even
know how we got them,

00:54:53.592 --> 00:54:54.800 align:middle line:90%
but they're running the show.

00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are.

00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And that is, essentially,
what the subconscious

00:54:58.270 --> 00:54:59.070 align:middle line:90%
is comprised of.

00:54:59.070 --> 00:54:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: That's what it is.

00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But also,
this carries over

00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:02.360 align:middle line:84%
from perhaps many,
many lifetimes.

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: They can, for sure.

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even
what's going on right

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.280 align:middle line:84%
now can be triggering us
because we've been in crises

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.810 align:middle line:90%
before in other times.

00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And it maybe didn't
go well for us.

00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I think in
times of stress,

00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:15.980 align:middle line:84%
it's really important,
if you're being disturbed

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:17.750 align:middle line:90%
by it, to look inside.

00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:18.733 align:middle line:90%
It can help a lot.

00:55:18.733 --> 00:55:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And you're really helping
guide people through this.

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: I hope so.

00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:24.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I feel like I've
dedicated my life to it.

00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:25.130 --> 00:55:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: And I keep going
because I see success

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:30.760 align:middle line:90%
constantly.

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:33.000 align:middle line:90%
I see miracles happening.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.510 align:middle line:90%
And I get motivated with that.

00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:37.550 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful to watch.

00:55:37.550 --> 00:55:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like there's
so much that people

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:43.520 align:middle line:84%
can do for themselves if they
just have a handful of tools.

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:46.730 align:middle line:90%
And you've got the tools, girl.

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:48.860 align:middle line:84%
Jan, thank you so much for
your beautiful presence

00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:49.730 align:middle line:90%
and your time.

00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And I love the fact that
you actually walk your talk.

00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:55.460 align:middle line:90%
You do maintain that joy inside.

00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And you do make it a commitment
to yourself, to your own being,

00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:01.940 align:middle line:84%
to maintain those high
frequencies and that joy.

00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that all of us

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.700 align:middle line:84%
need to start making
a priority now.

00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:06.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't
have a choice anymore.

00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:09.572 align:middle line:84%
The quality of the life
we're going to experience

00:56:09.572 --> 00:56:10.550 align:middle line:90%
is dependent on it now.

00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SMITH: Well, you know,
you mentioned January 2020,

00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:15.730 align:middle line:84%
and that's when my
husband passed away.

00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:19.490 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: And this has been
something that it's really

00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:21.710 align:middle line:10%
taken me right down to my core.

00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:28.340 align:middle line:10%
And I can see now how it's
saving me on so many levels

00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:31.230 align:middle line:10%
to have that understanding,
you know, to move through this.

00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And you've been very graceful
in a very difficult time

00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:38.528 align:middle line:84%
where this man has
been your best friend.

00:56:38.528 --> 00:56:40.195 align:middle line:84%
And this was very
sudden and unexpected.

00:56:40.195 --> 00:56:40.995 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: Yeah.

00:56:40.995 --> 00:56:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so--

00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:42.788 align:middle line:90%
>>SMITH: But thank you.

00:56:42.788 --> 00:56:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And you've been so helpful with
me through all this, Regina.

00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:46.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm so thankful for that.

00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:47.380 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you.

00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:49.940 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: We have
mutual respect.

00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:52.125 align:middle line:10%
So-- so much-- again,
thank you so much, Jan,

00:56:52.125 --> 00:56:54.250 align:middle line:10%
for taking the time to be
here and share all this--

00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:55.322 align:middle line:10%
>>SMITH: Absolutely.

I hope people just feel better.

00:57:01.995 --> 00:57:03.620 align:middle line:90%
