00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.400 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: The last
time I sat with Freddy Silva,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.500 align:middle line:10%
we discussed his book "The
Lost Art of Resurrection,"

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.356 align:middle line:10%
which turned the common notion
of that word on its head.

00:00:35.356 --> 00:00:36.730 align:middle line:84%
In today's interview,
we're going

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.335 align:middle line:84%
to go deeper into the mystery
of the ancient practice

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:41.460 align:middle line:84%
of journeying into the
other world, which according

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.290 align:middle line:84%
to Freddy, is what the great
temples were constructed for

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.330 align:middle line:90%
to begin with, right?

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.205 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY SILVA: Absolutely.

00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They weren't tombs.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.410 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: No, no one's
ever buried anywhere.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian department
of antiquities

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.794 align:middle line:90%
really needs to get up to speed.

00:00:53.794 --> 00:00:55.710 align:middle line:84%
But we'll talk about all
that in a little bit.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.090 align:middle line:84%
First of all, what I'd like
to do, if you don't mind,

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.600 align:middle line:84%
is to do-- because this
conversation is really--

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.590 align:middle line:84%
we're segueing out of
the last conversation.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.349 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to recommend
that you go and watch

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.630 align:middle line:84%
the other conversation, my
last interview with Freddy.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.190 align:middle line:84%
But in lieu of that, can you
just do a little segue for us,

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.660 align:middle line:84%
a little quick
recap on the points

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.442 align:middle line:84%
you were making that we're going
to dive into a little further.

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:17.990 align:middle line:10%
>>FREDDY: We're
going to do a much

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.676 align:middle line:10%
more into the concept of the
other world, which is what we

00:01:20.676 --> 00:01:21.925 align:middle line:10%
began this whole conversation.

00:01:21.925 --> 00:01:24.950 align:middle line:10%
And it was really to do
with how you get there.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.380 align:middle line:10%
And back about 14,000
years ago, there

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.940 align:middle line:10%
were writing some
very strange things

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.280 align:middle line:10%
in books in southern India.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.390 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about how
the gods built temples that

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.480 align:middle line:90%
allow people to become as gods.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.700 align:middle line:84%
They would leave
as bright stars.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And it made me wonder why,
if you go to a temple,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.630 align:middle line:84%
how do you become a
god and a bright star?

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that they
were used for a process called

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.625 align:middle line:84%
initiation, well, like the words
we have today for magic, which

00:01:53.625 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:84%
you think it's all about waving
wands about and dressing up

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.540 align:middle line:90%
in fancy costumes.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.920 align:middle line:90%
It has nothing to do that.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Initiation-- in
fact, it actually

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:90%
means to become conscious.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.130 align:middle line:84%
So something about
entering the temples

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.289 align:middle line:84%
allowed you to become conscious
of another level of reality.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And what they did was they
built temples in certain places

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.260 align:middle line:84%
under certain conditions, which
allowed you to-- how would

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.120 align:middle line:84%
you say-- raise your
electrical level of being.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.450 align:middle line:84%
We're electrical
beings as bodies.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And so the processes
that took place

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.020 align:middle line:84%
the temples allowed you to raise
your level of vibration bit

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.820 align:middle line:90%
by bit.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And you'd go from
temple to temple,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.140 align:middle line:84%
slowly raising your
level of resonance

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.847 align:middle line:90%
with the outside world.

00:02:37.847 --> 00:02:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Because it's just like if
you're a climber, if you

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.091 align:middle line:84%
get to the Himalayas,
the higher you climb,

00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:44.090 align:middle line:84%
the more you have to stop
and acclimate yourself

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.510 align:middle line:90%
to the height.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with
your body-- you'd

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.330 align:middle line:84%
have to basically go
from temple to temple,

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.360 align:middle line:84%
raise your frequency, stop,
take charge of your emotions,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.470 align:middle line:84%
take charge of
electrical circuits,

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and then you'd slowly graduate
to much higher levels of being.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready-- and not
everybody was cut out for this,

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.280 align:middle line:84%
by the way-- required
a lot of patience,

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.780 align:middle line:84%
usually over the course of three
years-- they had nothing better

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.730 align:middle line:84%
to do back then--
you would basically

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.140 align:middle line:84%
reach a point where
you'd become an initiate

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.080 align:middle line:90%
of the inner temple.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's where basically
you undertook an initiation

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.360 align:middle line:84%
ceremony which allowed you,
for a few hours or a few days,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.790 align:middle line:84%
to have a near-death experience,
which sounds really ridiculous

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.170 align:middle line:90%
when you think about it.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Why would I want to put
myself into an experience

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.530 align:middle line:84%
where I want to have a
near-death experience?

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, the idea was
that you would do this

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.010 align:middle line:84%
under a controlled method
that allowed your soul

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.190 align:middle line:84%
to leave the body, go walk
about into the other world,

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.530 align:middle line:84%
and return to the
body with information,

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.230 align:middle line:84%
specific information,
about the laws of physics,

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.130 align:middle line:84%
the laws of nature,
communication

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.302 align:middle line:84%
with deceased people,
communication with spirits.

00:03:50.302 --> 00:03:51.760 align:middle line:84%
But the fundamental
point of it was

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.830 align:middle line:84%
that you came back with
specialist knowledge

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.660 align:middle line:90%
about how the universe works.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is very important,
because you come back

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.650 align:middle line:84%
into a living body with the
mechanics of nature hard-wired

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.790 align:middle line:84%
into your soul, now you can
walk about in your daily life

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.750 align:middle line:84%
knowing where you're
going and what

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.050 align:middle line:84%
you can do as a
conscious being, which

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.530 align:middle line:84%
means you have control
over the manifestation

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.910 align:middle line:90%
process in your life.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
self-empowering thing.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's
juxtapose that

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.019 align:middle line:84%
to today, when the Masons
go through their rituals

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.109 align:middle line:90%
to go to your 33rd degree.

00:04:23.109 --> 00:04:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: Of course, you don't
have to kill you and everybody

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.628 align:middle line:90%
else in this room--

00:04:27.628 --> 00:04:29.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
been written about.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Step by step, it's
been written about.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.530 align:middle line:90%
But maybe I'm jaded.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: No, not at all.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a big mystery behind
the 33rd degree of free masonry,

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.830 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the one thing that
everybody wants to reach.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.040 align:middle line:90%
I have friends who are--

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But isn't
Bush 33rd degree?

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.100 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Yes.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.940 align:middle line:90%
We're dealing with just energy.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.385 align:middle line:84%
All of these mystery
secrets are all energy.

00:04:51.385 --> 00:04:53.339 align:middle line:90%
And energy doesn't care.

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:54.880 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't care one
way or the other.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not positive or negative.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.000 align:middle line:90%
It just is.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the thing is, just
because a person is declared

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.470 align:middle line:84%
33rd degree Mason does not
mean they have achieved

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:90%
those levels of refinement.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.017 align:middle line:84%
That's the bone I
have to pick about it.

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: And it's
absolutely correct,

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.220 align:middle line:84%
because it's the attention
and the intention you

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.960 align:middle line:84%
bring to that energy that
defines its direction.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.100 align:middle line:84%
So people who are working
for the right reasons

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.430 align:middle line:84%
with that energy,
they take it on

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.537 align:middle line:84%
to benefit themselves, but
for the greater good as well.

00:05:23.537 --> 00:05:25.120 align:middle line:84%
But then there are
those people within

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.210 align:middle line:84%
certain Masonic fraternities--
not all of them--

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.530 align:middle line:84%
who are using it for control,
power, political gain.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.794 align:middle line:90%
That's not how you do it.

00:05:32.794 --> 00:05:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think
the point you just

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.920 align:middle line:90%
made is really important.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.020 align:middle line:84%
There are different--
they're not chapters.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.620 align:middle line:84%
There are different factions
of the Masonic organization,

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.000 align:middle line:84%
some who take the original
teachings very seriously

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.230 align:middle line:84%
and protect it with
their lives, and others

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:84%
who-- Skull and Bonesers,
perhaps more often than others,

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.655 align:middle line:84%
are using it for other
purposes entirely.

00:05:53.655 --> 00:05:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Absolutely.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lot of friends
in Scottish Rite freemasonry

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.830 align:middle line:84%
which, as far as
I can figure out,

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.310 align:middle line:84%
are still performing many
of the original concepts

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.690 align:middle line:84%
of the mystery schools
in their entirety,

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.500 align:middle line:90%
sometimes just symbolically.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.800 align:middle line:84%
They still, for example,
conduct the raising

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.720 align:middle line:84%
of the dead ceremony, the
resurrection ceremony,

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.780 align:middle line:84%
where the candidate
is figuratively

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.220 align:middle line:90%
risen from a grave.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.799 align:middle line:84%
And then because
he or she has come

00:06:16.799 --> 00:06:18.340 align:middle line:84%
to know the secrets
of the mysteries,

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.150 align:middle line:84%
the blindfold is removed because
now they can see the light.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:84%
So back in the old
days, 2000 years ago,

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.040 align:middle line:84%
people would actually go into
an actual sarcophagus or a cave

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.279 align:middle line:84%
and they would take a
narcotic, a mild narcotic--

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And leave their body.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: And they'd
leave the body.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.590 align:middle line:84%
They'd come back into a
living body very groggy.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.920 align:middle line:84%
The experience was written
by the Greek philosophers.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.440 align:middle line:90%
It was a harrowing experience.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.430 align:middle line:84%
But they came back with some
extraordinary information.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Later, Pythagoras,
all these people

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.990 align:middle line:84%
came back with
extraordinary information.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And they said it was
worth it, and they did it

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.500 align:middle line:90%
again and again.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.330 align:middle line:84%
I think Plato actually
did it four times,

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.130 align:middle line:90%
so there was a huge benefit.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And it shaped not just their
philosophical doctrine,

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.740 align:middle line:84%
but it went on to define
their view of metaphysics

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.540 align:middle line:90%
in this life.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, which
is very present

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.780 align:middle line:90%
and center in their writings.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And do you know by chance
what the entheogen was

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.320 align:middle line:90%
that they used at that time?

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Oh, yeah.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when I do
this in lectures,

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.452 align:middle line:84%
I often look around
at the audience

00:07:16.452 --> 00:07:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and find it's the one
time everybody brings out

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.354 align:middle line:90%
their notepads.

00:07:20.354 --> 00:07:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They want to know
where they can score it.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Forget the years of preparation.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: Can you get
that at Whole Foods?

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Actually, it's natural herbs.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.360 align:middle line:90%
There was ergot.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.630 align:middle line:90%
There was Syrian rue.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.667 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, that was
blue water lily.

00:07:35.667 --> 00:07:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you
find the blue water

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.240 align:middle line:84%
lily inside many
sarcophagi without any body

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.380 align:middle line:90%
inside the sarcophagi.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was supposed to be
an incredible responsibility

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.700 align:middle line:90%
by the priests.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.030 align:middle line:84%
They were highly technical
in the use of these drugs,

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.830 align:middle line:90%
because it's like arsenic.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.540 align:middle line:84%
If you can take 3%
arsenic, it actually

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.380 align:middle line:84%
does something for your
body that's beneficial.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.380 align:middle line:90%
8% of arsenic will kill you.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was the same thing
with Syrian rue or ergot

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.600 align:middle line:90%
or any of those dilutions.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.140 align:middle line:84%
You had to get the
dilution absolutely right

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:13.907 align:middle line:84%
just to allow you to have-- to
feel calm enough to go and have

00:08:13.907 --> 00:08:14.990 align:middle line:90%
an out of body experience.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Because it was an
induced near-death

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.120 align:middle line:84%
experience that
they were having.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.350 align:middle line:84%
So just to calm them
down enough but keeping

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.770 align:middle line:84%
focused so that when
the soul crossed over,

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.610 align:middle line:84%
they would actually
do it very easily.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.620 align:middle line:84%
So if they messed up
on any part of this,

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.930 align:middle line:84%
if the priest or priestess
messed up on this,

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:34.169 align:middle line:84%
they would be excommunicated
under really rigorous terms,

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:36.135 align:middle line:84%
or they would have
to atone for a year.

00:08:36.135 --> 00:08:37.760 align:middle line:84%
So they were really
serious about this,

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.089 align:middle line:90%
and people would die.

00:08:39.089 --> 00:08:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just going to
say, and worse, people died.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: So people often go to
the Great Pyramid, for example,

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.123 align:middle line:84%
and they go into the
sarcophagus like they used to

00:08:48.123 --> 00:08:49.190 align:middle line:90%
in the old days.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And every couple of years,
someone goes in there,

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.557 align:middle line:90%
does it wrong, and they die.

00:08:53.557 --> 00:08:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, that's the
point I was going to bring up.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.650 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to participate in
entheogens for this to happen,

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:04.870 align:middle line:84%
for people to have just a
thimble full of knowledge

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.290 align:middle line:84%
and try to catapult
themselves into something

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:10.061 align:middle line:84%
and not know how
to go all the way

00:09:10.061 --> 00:09:11.810 align:middle line:84%
and get caught up
somewhere along the way,

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:13.210 align:middle line:90%
this is super dangerous.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:14.010 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: It is.

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:15.427 align:middle line:84%
You got to know
what you're doing.

00:09:15.427 --> 00:09:16.510 align:middle line:90%
You got to have a roadmap.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is why so
many of the texts that

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.716 align:middle line:84%
were written, for
example, in some

00:09:19.716 --> 00:09:22.540 align:middle line:84%
of the chambers in Egypt--
the pyramid of Unis

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.812 align:middle line:90%
is a great example.

00:09:23.812 --> 00:09:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Unis was never buried
in his own pyramid.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.900 align:middle line:90%
He was buried next door.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.350 align:middle line:84%
So you have to ask yourself, why
would the pharaoh with one body

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.710 align:middle line:90%
require two places of burial?

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, the pyramid of Unis has
a chamber inside it, which

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.910 align:middle line:90%
is the underground chamber.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And covering the walls of that
chamber are the pyramid texts.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And if you read
them very carefully,

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.520 align:middle line:84%
as a couple of Danish
archaeologists have,

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.850 align:middle line:84%
they actually said, well,
actually the instructions

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.680 align:middle line:84%
are meant for a living person
that's leaving the body,

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.740 align:middle line:84%
going into the other
world, getting information,

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.897 align:middle line:84%
and is expected to come
back into a living body.

00:09:57.897 --> 00:09:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing
with, for example, there's

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.880 align:middle line:84%
a tomb in the
Valley of the Kings

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.150 align:middle line:90%
which is totally anomalous.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:07.660 align:middle line:84%
Thutmose III, first of all,
he was buried a mile away

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:08.830 align:middle line:90%
in the temple of Hatshepsut.

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:12.280 align:middle line:84%
So again, why would one pharaoh
require two places of burial?

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.030 align:middle line:90%
He only has one body.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.040 align:middle line:84%
There's a well
inside the chamber.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.521 align:middle line:84%
Why does a dead person need
a well to drink water from?

00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:22.020 align:middle line:84%
It's aligned to the
northeast, which

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:26.150 align:middle line:84%
is the traditional direction
of the midsummer sunrise, which

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.390 align:middle line:84%
is equated with knowledge, the
highest position of the light.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:30.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's exactly
the kind of thing

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:32.870 align:middle line:90%
you get when you're initiated.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.220 align:middle line:90%
You cross into the other side.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.089 align:middle line:90%
You come back with knowledge.

00:10:36.089 --> 00:10:37.630 align:middle line:84%
So when you put
these things together

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.517 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the
sarcophagus, you think,

00:10:39.517 --> 00:10:41.850 align:middle line:84%
well, there's no one actually
buried in the sarcophagus,

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.494 align:middle line:90%
and it was found sealed.

00:10:43.494 --> 00:10:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And again, you look at the
texts around the chamber.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.810 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The Treatise
of the Hidden Chamber,"

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.710 align:middle line:84%
and it tells you that the
pharaoh or the initiate

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:52.340 align:middle line:84%
took a voluntary
near-death experience,

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.310 align:middle line:84%
went walk about into
the other world,

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.790 align:middle line:84%
knew everything about
the mechanics of nature,

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.820 align:middle line:84%
came back into the body
and was expected to do so,

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.060 align:middle line:84%
and after a difficult
recovery went back

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:84%
into his normal
daily activities,

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.940 align:middle line:90%
completely aware, awake.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they were called
risen, or risen from the dead.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which was the point of
"The Lost Art of Resurrection."

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Exactly.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:14.741 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And just
because we didn't really

00:11:14.741 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:84%
go there at the top of
this conversation, that

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.990 align:middle line:84%
is where our conversation
left off, was this practice.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And now the word
"resurrection" has

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.420 align:middle line:84%
been misunderstood
throughout history the way

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.455 align:middle line:90%
you're defining it.

00:11:26.455 --> 00:11:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Oh, totally.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
at least 23 people

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.250 align:middle line:84%
that answer to the
description of a guy who

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.030 align:middle line:90%
gets-- he's born in the cave.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:36.490 align:middle line:84%
He has a mother who
is a divine virgin.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.532 align:middle line:84%
He goes walk about for 40
days in the wilderness,

00:11:38.532 --> 00:11:39.990 align:middle line:84%
comes back, gets
nailed to a cross,

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.330 align:middle line:84%
gets up three days later
in the winter solstice.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is 3,000
years before Jesus.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:90%
We have a problem here.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Krishna, for example,
if you put the stories

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:52.710 align:middle line:84%
of Krishna and Jesus together,
there's 346 similarities.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And yet Krishna was around
at least 500 years before.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.640 align:middle line:84%
So the whole concept
of resurrection

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.530 align:middle line:84%
was part of the-- it
was the highest level

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.770 align:middle line:90%
of initiation in the temples.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:04.580 align:middle line:84%
You were basically
risen from the dead.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.045 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
they said that--

00:12:06.045 --> 00:12:08.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And self-actualized,
if you did it right.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Oh, absolutely.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Because the people who
hadn't experienced this,

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.460 align:middle line:84%
they were just walking
about as if they were dead.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:18.455 align:middle line:84%
They have no other understanding
about the reality of nature.

00:12:18.455 --> 00:12:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When we talked
about "The Lost Art

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.850 align:middle line:84%
of Resurrection"-- stop me
if-- did I tell you about that

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:25.300 align:middle line:84%
experience I had where I
got lost in that other place

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.700 align:middle line:90%
between?

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.930 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't it awful?

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.770 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, I had just
enough knowledge

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and had successfully,
with another person--

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.660 align:middle line:84%
we had been trained in this
for over a period of time--

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.940 align:middle line:84%
was able to leave the
body, go to another place,

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.930 align:middle line:84%
different density, experience
that, and come back safely

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:41.750 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.550 align:middle line:84%
A little sludgy, a
little depressing

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:47.580 align:middle line:84%
coming back-- heaviness, very
tired, but was able to do it.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.200 align:middle line:84%
This particular time,
I didn't pay attention

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.660 align:middle line:84%
to the instructions and
said, let's do it anyway.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And we did, and it
wasn't set up correctly.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:59.910 align:middle line:84%
But the point being that I
didn't feel right when I got

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:00.710 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.050 align:middle line:90%
Something was really wrong.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And then I had a
dream I had 18 months

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.285 align:middle line:84%
to live if I didn't fix this
enormous blowout in the aura

00:13:07.285 --> 00:13:08.600 align:middle line:90%
of this entire side.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.270 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh, really?

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.260 align:middle line:84%
So a friend of
mine said, Regina,

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.890 align:middle line:84%
go get a picture
of your aura taken,

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:18.047 align:middle line:84%
and I did, at the best machine
they had in Sedona at the time,

00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:18.880 align:middle line:90%
which was a new one.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.050 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty good.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.220 align:middle line:90%
That whole side was black.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.130 align:middle line:90%
It was totally blown out.

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Interesting.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:26.300 align:middle line:84%
I had it repaired, and I got
a lecture as a result of that.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.610 align:middle line:84%
But the point was, right after
that I read Tony Bushby's book.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.040 align:middle line:84%
I think it was "Secrets
of the Pyramid."

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And they talked about the
three Portuguese priests who

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.720 align:middle line:90%
had gone through that journey.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.470 align:middle line:84%
One died, one lost his
mind, and one came back

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:46.320 align:middle line:84%
and was sound enough to tell
about the experience of having

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.450 align:middle line:90%
gone through that.

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Very similar experience
to what I went through.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I say, I
haven't dared do it since.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.410 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to really put
myself together properly

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:56.310 align:middle line:90%
to ever consider it.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:59.805 align:middle line:84%
It was very dangerous,
what happened.

00:13:59.805 --> 00:14:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: You have to
know what you're doing.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.990 align:middle line:84%
You have to-- and this is
why people went from temple

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.070 align:middle line:84%
to temple, raising
their awareness,

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.350 align:middle line:90%
raising electrical circuits.

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And you do it
slowly, consciously.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Because we're operating
at one of the densest

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.750 align:middle line:90%
levels of reality.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:20.310 align:middle line:84%
We're sort of 88 FM on the dial
and we're going to 2000 FM.

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:21.950 align:middle line:84%
To get from here
to there, you have

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:24.184 align:middle line:84%
to really have a certain
state of consciousness.

00:14:24.184 --> 00:14:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
I only bring that up

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.955 align:middle line:84%
because I know people
listening think, oh, I'm

00:14:27.955 --> 00:14:28.830 align:middle line:90%
going to go to Egypt.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.246 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
this experience.

00:14:30.246 --> 00:14:31.500 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't work like that.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:35.020 align:middle line:84%
When you blow apart into
billions of bits and particles,

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.930 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't reassemble
right unless you really

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.670 align:middle line:90%
have done your due diligence.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And I had before,
but not this time.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.270 align:middle line:90%
And so yeah, this is a big deal.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Absolutely.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this whole process,
this dispersing of self,

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:52.870 align:middle line:84%
going somewhere else and
then reassembling, that is

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.500 align:middle line:84%
the process you're
talking about.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.719 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: It's the
process of initiation.

00:14:56.719 --> 00:14:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you
literally do become conscious

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.310 align:middle line:90%
in the pure sense of the word.

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:02.300 align:middle line:84%
You are aware, not just
of a physical self,

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.900 align:middle line:84%
but there's a huge layer
of information around you

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.930 align:middle line:84%
that you can access
consciously and under control.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's what defines
the process from shamanism,

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.390 align:middle line:84%
for example, unless
you do it a lot.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And the whole difference
was-- and this

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.200 align:middle line:84%
did fascinate me--
to find out, how

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.620 align:middle line:84%
does this differ from, say
taking ayahuasca or something.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:21.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Totally different.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.755 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: And they
said, no, it's

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:25.780 align:middle line:84%
to do with coming back,
going into the spirit world

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.684 align:middle line:84%
consciously, under control,
and remembering everything

00:15:29.684 --> 00:15:31.600 align:middle line:84%
that you'd done and been
given and coming back

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.240 align:middle line:84%
into the body with
complete knowledge.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you've had the REM
sleep and you come back

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.850 align:middle line:84%
into the body, how much do you
remember of your dream state?

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.030 align:middle line:90%
Not that much.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.310 align:middle line:90%
This was completely different.

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.000 align:middle line:84%
This was if your
conscious self is

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.160 align:middle line:84%
going into the spirit
world consciously

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.020 align:middle line:90%
and coming back consciously.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:51.180 align:middle line:84%
In shamanism, you're lucky it
to remember 50% of what you've

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.669 align:middle line:90%
done and where you've been.

00:15:52.669 --> 00:15:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they
took it very seriously,

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.850 align:middle line:84%
because the
information was meant

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:58.370 align:middle line:90%
to be used in your daily life.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.120 align:middle line:84%
So you live your life totally
consciously and aware,

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.810 align:middle line:84%
controlled too,
control of the self.

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is not only
an invitation, but a warning.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.900 align:middle line:84%
When I had done it
correctly-- totally conscious

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:12.087 align:middle line:84%
the whole time, no drugs,
just did it properly-- you

00:16:12.087 --> 00:16:13.920 align:middle line:84%
have to have the elements
together properly.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Oh, absolutely.

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
location, when you're

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:21.050 align:middle line:84%
talking about the location
in terms of the initiations,

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and you also say some of the
temples, some of the temples

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.360 align:middle line:84%
that were used for
initiation were what

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.252 align:middle line:90%
you call dangerous locations.

00:16:29.252 --> 00:16:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: Some of
these temples are

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.520 align:middle line:84%
built in the most
irrational, stupid locations.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Hua Shan is one
of them in China.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:42.022 align:middle line:84%
To get up to Hua Shan you
have to actually walk up

00:16:42.022 --> 00:16:44.480 align:middle line:84%
the site of a vertical mountain,
and there's planks of wood

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.146 align:middle line:90%
that are about this long.

00:16:47.146 --> 00:16:49.520 align:middle line:84%
They're actually bolted together
to the side of the cliff

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.464 align:middle line:90%
using little metal rods.

00:16:51.464 --> 00:16:52.630 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to look down.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:52.905 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why?

00:16:52.905 --> 00:16:53.904 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Well, exactly.

00:16:53.904 --> 00:16:55.571 align:middle line:90%
Why do they do this?

00:16:55.571 --> 00:16:57.070 align:middle line:84%
There's another one
as well in China

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.444 align:middle line:84%
which is the Tiger's
Nest temple which is also

00:16:59.444 --> 00:17:00.735 align:middle line:90%
bolted on the side of the hill.

00:17:00.735 --> 00:17:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And only 300 yards below
is a beautiful river plain.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.780 align:middle line:84%
You think, well, why
not just build it there?

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
pictures of that, right?

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:08.829 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Oh, absolutely.

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And you look at
it and you think,

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.250 align:middle line:84%
these people were
smoking something,

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:14.342 align:middle line:84%
or they're trying to do to
show they could defy gravity.

00:17:14.342 --> 00:17:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out
the reason why they're

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.990 align:middle line:84%
placed in such irrational
places is because they're

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:21.390 align:middle line:84%
taking some of the
energy that's already

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:22.979 align:middle line:90%
inherent at that location.

00:17:22.979 --> 00:17:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that
many of these temples

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:28.284 align:middle line:84%
are lying strategically
at geomagnetic hotspots.

00:17:28.284 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:84%
They're lying in places where
the electromagnetic field is

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.800 align:middle line:84%
stimulated, and also where
the Earth's currents also

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.730 align:middle line:90%
move through.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.170 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
points are actually

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:40.680 align:middle line:84%
fundamental to helping
you escape the body.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.160 align:middle line:84%
In fact, once you
master the laws

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.340 align:middle line:84%
of gravity and electromagnetism,
because your body is built

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.330 align:middle line:84%
of the same stuff, once
you've got that mastered,

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.100 align:middle line:84%
then obviously leaving the
body is that much easier.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.600 align:middle line:84%
So the answer to that
question, why did they

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.900 align:middle line:84%
build these beautiful
temples in silly places,

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.330 align:middle line:84%
which are so hard to access
but great fun when you do,

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.540 align:middle line:84%
is because you're already
halfway out of your body

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:02.530 align:middle line:90%
when you get there.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:04.630 align:middle line:84%
So they're taking
advantage of an underlying

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:06.140 align:middle line:90%
energy in the first place.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
and you Silbury Hill

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.900 align:middle line:84%
was one of these unstable
or dangerous locations.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: It's built on-- again,
if you think about it, when

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:19.020 align:middle line:84%
you go to Silbury Hill-- and for
people who haven't been there,

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.676 align:middle line:90%
it's a man-made hill.

00:18:20.676 --> 00:18:22.300 align:middle line:84%
People call it a
pyramid, but it's not.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a conical mound.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's built, its foundation
is on the lowest point

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.524 align:middle line:90%
of the local landscape.

00:18:28.524 --> 00:18:30.315 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's odd when
you come across it.

00:18:30.315 --> 00:18:31.610 align:middle line:90%
It's like, what happened there?

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: Yes, why not
start at the top of the hill

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.780 align:middle line:90%
and keep building?

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.029 align:middle line:84%
No, we're going to go through
the bottom part of the--

00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:37.950 align:middle line:84%
where the water is and
then keep building up.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the
reason right there.

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:41.970 align:middle line:84%
You're taking advantage
of the waters percolating

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:43.680 align:middle line:84%
through the chalk,
which is creating

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.790 align:middle line:90%
its own electrical field anyway.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:48.860 align:middle line:84%
You're also at the boundary of
two different forms of rock.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.377 align:middle line:84%
And what science knows
about this-- it's

00:18:51.377 --> 00:18:52.210 align:middle line:90%
a very strange name.

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:53.918 align:middle line:84%
It's called a conductivity
discontinuity.

00:18:53.918 --> 00:18:56.220 align:middle line:90%


00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.840 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was the
Sioux called it scan.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.450 align:middle line:84%
They had a much easier way
to remember this stuff.

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:03.850 align:middle line:84%
They said that when you
actually build a temple

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.930 align:middle line:84%
next to two geological fracture
areas where the stone is

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.140 align:middle line:84%
slightly different,
you're creating

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.280 align:middle line:84%
a sort of discontinuity,
dissonance,

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.370 align:middle line:84%
in the local
electromagnetic field.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you just open
yourself to that,

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.030 align:middle line:84%
you begin to have an out of body
experience just by being there.

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:22.060 align:middle line:84%
So Silbury Hill is built exactly
at the confluence of those two

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.030 align:middle line:90%
points.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And also, the fact
that the hill itself

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:28.850 align:middle line:84%
is built of alternate layers of
organic and inorganic material

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:31.270 align:middle line:84%
acts like an
accumulator, a battery,

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.980 align:middle line:84%
on top of water, which
has an electrical charge.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you, you
shouldn't go and climb Silbury.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.460 align:middle line:90%
You do not feel well afterwards.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.126 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going
to say, because it

00:19:40.126 --> 00:19:42.440 align:middle line:84%
means that this is
taking you in your field

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.820 align:middle line:84%
and it's kind of fracturing
or putting it out

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.820 align:middle line:84%
of resonance with
itself in order

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.330 align:middle line:84%
to create enough of a
fracture to leave the body.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Exactly.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.190 align:middle line:84%
You begin to perceive
that you're taking part

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:54.640 align:middle line:90%
in another level of reality.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And it can be
quite debilitating.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:59.080 align:middle line:84%
You really come back
down off the hill.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying this
because I've done it.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I gathered.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: I'm sometimes
sort of eat it and taste it

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:05.345 align:middle line:90%
in order to teach this stuff.

00:20:05.345 --> 00:20:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Then I can say, you
really shouldn't do that,

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.914 align:middle line:90%
because-- it does.

00:20:08.914 --> 00:20:11.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like the top of your
body's spinning in one way

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.830 align:middle line:84%
and the bottom of your body's
spinning the other way.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And you feel
discombobulated, and that's

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:18.060 align:middle line:84%
part of the process
of dismembering you

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.167 align:middle line:84%
so you can stop being
in the body and leave.

00:20:20.167 --> 00:20:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if someone
says, oh, that sounds fun,

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.270 align:middle line:84%
I think I'll do it-- how do
you put yourself back together

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:25.195 align:middle line:90%
afterward?

00:20:25.195 --> 00:20:27.770 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: We drink a lot.

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:29.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Besides British pubs.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Actually, it's true.

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:33.170 align:middle line:84%
I find that drinking
wheat beer especially

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:34.780 align:middle line:90%
is very good for grounding.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.114 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it is about
wheat beer and lot of meat

00:20:37.114 --> 00:20:37.913 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:20:37.913 --> 00:20:39.210 align:middle line:90%
You have to ground yourself.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:41.217 align:middle line:84%
You do fasting when
you do initiation.

00:20:41.217 --> 00:20:42.800 align:middle line:84%
But then when you
come back out of it,

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.480 align:middle line:84%
you drink a lot of fluids
and put a lot of meat

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.640 align:middle line:84%
back in your system
to ground yourself.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you find
it really difficult

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:50.540 align:middle line:90%
being back in the body.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's why I ask.

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:51.810 align:middle line:90%
I would think so.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Now another one of these places
is the Petroglyph National

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.975 align:middle line:90%
Monument outside of Albuquerque.

00:20:57.975 --> 00:20:59.100 align:middle line:90%
Now, I've never been there.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking for any Americans
who are watching this in case

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:04.300 align:middle line:84%
they want to make a trek,
tell us about that location.

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: Well,
the first thing you

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.086 align:middle line:84%
should know about
Petroglyph National Monument

00:21:07.086 --> 00:21:10.440 align:middle line:84%
is that if you happen to
be cobra-phobic, as I am,

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.090 align:middle line:84%
you really don't
want to go there.

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:13.710 align:middle line:90%
It's full of snakes.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:17.310 align:middle line:84%
It's the prime residents of
rattlesnakes in Albuquerque

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:18.590 align:middle line:90%
and the whole of New Mexico.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And yet it has one of the
greatest amount of petroglyphs

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.080 align:middle line:90%
anywhere in North America.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.805 align:middle line:84%
So you have to think,
well, why would you

00:21:24.805 --> 00:21:26.536 align:middle line:90%
be crazy enough to do this?

00:21:26.536 --> 00:21:27.660 align:middle line:90%
Again, for the same reason.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.190 align:middle line:84%
You have a conductivity
discontinuity in this area.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.900 align:middle line:84%
You got two fracture
zones, where just

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:37.030 align:middle line:84%
because of that rubbing of
two different areas of soil,

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:40.540 align:middle line:84%
you create a highly
intense electrical field.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.610 align:middle line:84%
So the images that you
see in the petroglyphs

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.110 align:middle line:84%
are the remains
of people who went

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:48.670 align:middle line:84%
there, left the body in
initiatory states, came back

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:52.270 align:middle line:84%
and they describe what they saw
in their own symbolic manner.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.450 align:middle line:84%
So everywhere you find
groups of petroglyphs

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:56.850 align:middle line:84%
around the Southwest
in America, those

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:58.867 align:middle line:84%
are places where the
shamans used to go.

00:21:58.867 --> 00:22:00.200 align:middle line:90%
People actually used to be sent.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.325 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they were
looking for that dissonance,

00:22:02.325 --> 00:22:03.260 align:middle line:90%
that type of energy.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.120 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: They could feel it.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:04.960 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
to build a temple.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.090 align:middle line:84%
They knew the temple
was already there.

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So they'd go there and
they'd use the natural energy

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:12.455 align:middle line:84%
of the land to help them
achieve that out of body state.

00:22:12.455 --> 00:22:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they would do
this for three days and three

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:15.400 align:middle line:90%
nights.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.820 align:middle line:84%
It's not unusual for Native
American cultures to do that.

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.403 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Once you
lose your bearings,

00:22:19.403 --> 00:22:21.884 align:middle line:84%
you might as well stick
around, I suppose.

00:22:21.884 --> 00:22:23.550 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: You come
back, what day is it?

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You say a lot
of the Gothic cathedrals

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:29.420 align:middle line:84%
were also built in these
geomagnetic hot spots

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and with that type of geometry
that would facilitate this.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.850 align:middle line:84%
What are a few of your favorite
temples, or cathedrals?

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: So many of them.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.770 align:middle line:84%
The Gothic cathedrals came
late into the whole mixture.

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:44.880 align:middle line:84%
After about 1,000
years of subversion,

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.430 align:middle line:84%
the Templars and the
Cistercians figured a way

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.190 align:middle line:84%
to hardwire the information that
they learned in the Middle East

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:52.112 align:middle line:84%
into Europe, which
back then was governed

00:22:52.112 --> 00:22:53.070 align:middle line:90%
by the Catholic church.

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the
Gothic cathedral

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.640 align:middle line:84%
geometry does have a lot
of Islamic characteristics.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.760 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Exactly.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not the same
as the Islamic arch.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:84%
It slightly different,
ever so slightly different.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And that creates a
certain musical dissonance

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.170 align:middle line:90%
in the entire building as well.

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:10.010 align:middle line:84%
But it's exactly
the same technology

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:12.940 align:middle line:84%
as hardwired into the
pyramids and Stonehenge,

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.440 align:middle line:90%
into chambers in South America.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just design
them differently

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:19.110 align:middle line:90%
to appeal to a different era.

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.960 align:middle line:84%
It's like trying to
appeal-- designing

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.670 align:middle line:84%
classical music to a different
audience in the 21st century.

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.640 align:middle line:84%
You got to electrify to bring
kids into the knowledge.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is how they got the
kids back in the 12th century,

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:31.755 align:middle line:90%
into the knowledge.

00:23:31.755 --> 00:23:33.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like, we'll
build you a cathedral.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
we do these days.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.190 align:middle line:84%
So they went, OK,
we'll go in there.

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:38.490 align:middle line:84%
But now these buildings
feel different

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:39.690 align:middle line:90%
to the other churches.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:40.940 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Because the relationship
between the pillars,

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.640 align:middle line:84%
the apse, the transept, the
altar-- everything in there

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.330 align:middle line:84%
was hardwired with an
invisible geometry.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:51.090 align:middle line:90%
And each one was different.

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Each one induces a
different effect, just

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:55.510 align:middle line:90%
like when you go to a pyramid.

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:58.450 align:middle line:84%
They all appear to be the same
pyramid, only they're not.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:00.130 align:middle line:84%
They're all slightly,
ever so slightly

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:02.000 align:middle line:90%
different, in slope angle.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And that makes all
the difference.

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Because each geometry
does something

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:07.080 align:middle line:90%
different to your body.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.210 align:middle line:84%
We're hardwired
with the same stuff.

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:11.700 align:middle line:84%
So we are naturally
attracted to geometry.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.660 align:middle line:84%
So the geometry was
there to actually begin

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:19.660 align:middle line:84%
to open up your body's sensory
organs to receive information.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.980 align:middle line:84%
So heptagonal geometry
will do something to you.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Hexagonal geometry will do
something very different.

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:30.040 align:middle line:84%
So let's say, take the pyramids
in Egypt as an example.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Some people going into the Great
Pyramid and yet other people

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:33.970 align:middle line:90%
hate it.

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:35.428 align:middle line:84%
But they'll go to
the one next door

00:24:35.428 --> 00:24:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and they'll say,
oh, I like it here.

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:38.880 align:middle line:84%
But the people who
enjoy the Great Pyramid

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.020 align:middle line:90%
don't like being there.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.882 align:middle line:84%
Because the slopes are
slightly different.

00:24:42.882 --> 00:24:45.090 align:middle line:84%
To the eye, they're almost
the same, but they're not.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:47.640 align:middle line:84%
You're creating a
different environment.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And the Russians actually
worked this out back

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.000 align:middle line:84%
in the '60s when they
were hard up for money.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.166 align:middle line:84%
They looked at this information
and they said, well,

00:24:54.166 --> 00:24:56.590 align:middle line:84%
what if it's true that the
Gothic cathedrals and all these

00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:00.220 align:middle line:84%
temples, with all their
geometry that you can't see,

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.730 align:middle line:84%
what if it's true that
you can actually feel this

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:04.190 align:middle line:84%
and it has an
effect on your body

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:05.523 align:middle line:90%
and your state of consciousness?

00:25:05.523 --> 00:25:08.880 align:middle line:84%
So they designed
rooms in hospitals

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.270 align:middle line:84%
that were shaped in pentagrams,
the symbol of healing

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:13.420 align:middle line:90%
in the Greek arts.

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.878 align:middle line:84%
And they found that
people who were

00:25:14.878 --> 00:25:17.550 align:middle line:84%
sick that go to a geometric
room shaped like a pentagram,

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:19.500 align:middle line:90%
they heal much quicker.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.270 align:middle line:90%
Same for schizophrenic patients.

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:22.930 align:middle line:84%
If you build a room
like a trapezoid,

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:24.700 align:middle line:90%
they heal and so forth.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:28.250 align:middle line:84%
So bingo, they realized
that shape, geometric shape

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:30.950 align:middle line:84%
has a fundamental effect
on opening your body's

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:35.210 align:middle line:84%
sensory perception in
order to be stimulated

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:36.710 align:middle line:90%
by an incoming energy.

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:38.942 align:middle line:84%
So that's how you
basically heal yourself.

00:25:38.942 --> 00:25:41.400 align:middle line:84%
You only have to then stretch
that concept a little further

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.470 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, if you're
stretching your body

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.930 align:middle line:84%
to accept a different
level of reality,

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:47.690 align:middle line:84%
why not allow the
body to receive

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:50.610 align:middle line:84%
a different level of frequency
that allows the soul then

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:52.450 align:middle line:90%
to have a different experience.

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:56.180 align:middle line:84%
So you have the buildings
used for healing on one level.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
a next level up,

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.842 align:middle line:84%
which is to take the
soul on an experience.

00:25:59.842 --> 00:26:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet
at the same time,

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.220 align:middle line:84%
the one thing most human
beings have in common

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:10.540 align:middle line:84%
is an innate attraction
towards symmetry.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the universe operates
on that kind of order.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And would you say these
spaces are essentially

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.710 align:middle line:90%
designed towards that?

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Oh, absolutely.

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:24.520 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you look again back
at the Piranas, which go back

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.510 align:middle line:84%
at least 14,000 years
and the Egyptian texts,

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:29.460 align:middle line:84%
they all talk about
the very same thing,

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.500 align:middle line:84%
that the temples were all built
as mirror images of the gods

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.142 align:middle line:90%
if not the gods themselves.

00:26:34.142 --> 00:26:35.600 align:middle line:84%
But the gods are
not what you and I

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:39.350 align:middle line:84%
would call a guy with a
beard sitting up in heaven.

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:43.670 align:middle line:84%
To them, the gods were
A, nature's principles,

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:44.506 align:middle line:90%
nature's laws.

00:26:44.506 --> 00:26:46.130 align:middle line:84%
They just gave them
a shape that helped

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:48.419 align:middle line:84%
us to illustrate
in our mind what

00:26:48.419 --> 00:26:49.960 align:middle line:84%
they would look like
if they actually

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.918 align:middle line:90%
manifested themselves--

00:26:50.918 --> 00:26:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And beauty, symmetry,
harmony-- all those things

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:57.820 align:middle line:90%
are intrinsic to their gods.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: And the
mystery schools

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:02.616 align:middle line:84%
recognize that the
experience for what it was.

00:27:02.616 --> 00:27:05.460 align:middle line:84%
It was a difficult
life, and the soul

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.310 align:middle line:84%
is imprisoned in a
body, which is trapped

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:09.090 align:middle line:84%
and it's susceptible
to all kinds

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:11.360 align:middle line:90%
of ills in the physical world.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.775 align:middle line:84%
They saw the physical world
as being very impure and full

00:27:13.775 --> 00:27:14.575 align:middle line:90%
of challenges.

00:27:14.575 --> 00:27:17.150 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to
build a temple that

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:20.630 align:middle line:84%
mimicked the perfection of
the heavens and the gods,

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:23.480 align:middle line:84%
if you as a troubled person
or a sick person going

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.400 align:middle line:84%
into the temple, then by
almost a process of osmosis,

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:30.150 align:middle line:84%
you would come out in the
mirror image of the god.

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:31.150 align:middle line:90%
You'd be as a god.

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:32.540 align:middle line:90%
You'd be perfected.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:35.930 align:middle line:84%
So you walk back upright,
no longer feel the need

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:38.940 align:middle line:90%
to kill people or be negative.

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:39.780 align:middle line:90%
I feel positive.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm totally aligned with
the laws of the universe,

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.750 align:middle line:84%
to the point where it
wasn't just one temple that

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:46.430 align:middle line:90%
was a mirror image of a god.

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:48.050 align:middle line:84%
It was a whole
group of them that

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:50.200 align:middle line:90%
mirrored entire constellations.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's quite a
concept, when you

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:55.790 align:middle line:84%
have 60 square miles of temples
as a mirror of the stars

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:57.724 align:middle line:84%
and all of them are
doing exactly that.

00:27:57.724 --> 00:27:59.140 align:middle line:84%
When you go from
temple to temple,

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:01.400 align:middle line:84%
you become a mirror
of that constellation.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.700 align:middle line:84%
You become a mirror of the
perfection of the universe.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:04.500 align:middle line:90%
And you can.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.510 align:middle line:84%
You walk outside and you
are perfect, or perfected.

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this brings a
couple of different things up.

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever been into a sacred
site that essentially was-- you

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:18.530 align:middle line:84%
talked about these sites being
located in disharmonic regions.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:23.830 align:middle line:84%
But have you ever been in a site
that was simply asymmetrical

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.960 align:middle line:84%
and had a lack of
harmony as a result of it

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.870 align:middle line:84%
that was created
for that purpose,

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:31.285 align:middle line:90%
to put you out of touch?

00:28:31.285 --> 00:28:32.510 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: No.

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:34.760 align:middle line:84%
I've actually found sites
which have being brought out

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.317 align:middle line:84%
of harmony because of the
harm that's been done in them

00:28:37.317 --> 00:28:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and the energy that's
been sucked into them,

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:44.190 align:middle line:84%
but never have I seen one
that brings it out of harmony.

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.360 align:middle line:90%
There's one very nasty place.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:47.740 align:middle line:90%
It's actually in England.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.657 align:middle line:84%
It's next to a very
good pub, by the way.

00:28:49.657 --> 00:28:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you can
ground yourself quickly

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:52.190 align:middle line:90%
after the experience.

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Exactly.

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:55.642 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it is
a giant's grave.

00:28:55.642 --> 00:28:56.850 align:middle line:10%
There's a giant buried there.

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:58.020 align:middle line:10%
It was a mound.

00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.640 align:middle line:10%
And during the
time of Henry VIII,

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.650 align:middle line:10%
he had built one of the
most notorious prisons

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:02.745 align:middle line:10%
on this mound.

00:29:02.745 --> 00:29:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, they
used to call it

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.980 align:middle line:84%
the most heinous, most
despisable building

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.050 align:middle line:90%
in the entire kingdom back then.

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:09.850 align:middle line:90%
And it was.

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:10.900 align:middle line:90%
It was like a torture chamber.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.525 align:middle line:84%
And I've gone in
there, and I tell you.

00:29:12.525 --> 00:29:14.650 align:middle line:84%
I've experienced lot
of energy in my life.

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:16.310 align:middle line:84%
I go in there for
15 seconds, and it's

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.090 align:middle line:84%
like watching acid
coming at you,

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and you walk right
back out again.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's the energy
of people, the torture--

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:26.637 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it possible
some horrible rites were

00:29:26.637 --> 00:29:27.845 align:middle line:90%
conducted there or something?

00:29:27.845 --> 00:29:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: It was just
basically a place

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:31.606 align:middle line:90%
where they tore people apart.

00:29:31.606 --> 00:29:33.480 align:middle line:84%
But the funny thing is,
it hasn't leached out

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.630 align:middle line:90%
onto the land.

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:37.400 align:middle line:84%
The pub is next door,
but the pub's fine.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.430 align:middle line:84%
It was such a contained energy,
where people are literally just

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:41.870 align:middle line:84%
shooting themselves
from this pain

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:43.560 align:middle line:90%
that the energy stays inside it.

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:47.700 align:middle line:84%
You need a group of 50 people
to go in there with a like mind

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:48.500 align:middle line:90%
and cleanse it.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:49.584 align:middle line:90%
And you can do this.

00:29:49.584 --> 00:29:51.500 align:middle line:84%
We've actually cleansed
sites around the world

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.458 align:middle line:90%
that have been misused.

00:29:52.458 --> 00:29:55.490 align:middle line:90%
This is a really nasty place.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not on your tour.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.135 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: Well, I
say people passed

00:29:58.135 --> 00:29:59.290 align:middle line:90%
it should have a cup of tea.

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And while having a
cup of tea, I'll say,

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:03.100 align:middle line:84%
[INTERPOSING VOICES] If you
want to experience the complete

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.250 align:middle line:84%
opposite of what we've
be learning for the trip,

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:07.452 align:middle line:84%
you want to go here,
or perhaps you don't

00:30:07.452 --> 00:30:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where's this?

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: It's in Devon.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's basically
next to Lydford Gorge,

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:17.130 align:middle line:90%
not far from Brentor Church.

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:19.399 align:middle line:84%
So you look at the site
and people usually say,

00:30:19.399 --> 00:30:20.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel the
need to go in there.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.730 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm picking
it up from here.

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:23.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, then.

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.347 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll go, take
a five minute drive

00:30:25.347 --> 00:30:27.680 align:middle line:84%
and we'll go somewhere else
and you feel uplifted again.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.480 align:middle line:84%
So the sites of
living organisms,

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.220 align:middle line:84%
they soak up what
is thrown in there.

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:35.680 align:middle line:84%
So if you misuse them, they
will begin to slowly soak up

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.660 align:middle line:90%
that information.

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.280 align:middle line:90%
Again, energy doesn't care.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.130 align:middle line:90%
It's just energy.

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:41.243 align:middle line:84%
So if you go into the
house of someone who's

00:30:41.243 --> 00:30:43.100 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of
negativity in there,

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.635 align:middle line:84%
you feel it
immediately in a home.

00:30:44.635 --> 00:30:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: But it
can be cleansed.

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.660 align:middle line:84%
People go to Glastonbury
all the time.

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:51.070 align:middle line:84%
One year Glastonbury will feel
fantastic, the next year, eh.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:52.430 align:middle line:90%
You got to back and cleanse it.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:55.070 align:middle line:90%
OK now, this is a little nuance.

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And that is from the time
some of these great artifacts

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.720 align:middle line:84%
such as the Great
Pyramid were constructed,

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:06.660 align:middle line:84%
they're not in alignment in
terms of the initial alignment

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.410 align:middle line:84%
created at the time
of their construction,

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:10.601 align:middle line:84%
with certain planetary
systems and so forth

00:31:10.601 --> 00:31:11.975 align:middle line:84%
is not in the same
alignment now.

00:31:11.975 --> 00:31:14.126 align:middle line:84%
Do you find that
that has-- well,

00:31:14.126 --> 00:31:16.000 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't know unless
you were remembering

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.166 align:middle line:90%
a past life from those days.

00:31:17.166 --> 00:31:20.246 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: Well, let me just go
into my 25,000 year history.

00:31:20.246 --> 00:31:21.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's highly contested as
to how old those pyramids are.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:middle line:84%
They're far, far-- John I
know John Anthony West will go

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.625 align:middle line:90%
so far as to say 35,000 years.

00:31:32.625 --> 00:31:34.000 align:middle line:84%
There are other
ancient sects who

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.370 align:middle line:90%
will go as far as 85,000 years.

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:42.210 align:middle line:84%
So it was overlaying the timing
of the Atlantean cultures.

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Either way, it was
a long time ago.

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:47.640 align:middle line:90%
And our axis has shifted a bit.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So what does that
do to these places?

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: Well,
here's a great answer

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.200 align:middle line:84%
to those people who always argue
about the age of the pyramids.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.760 align:middle line:84%
All the ancient sacred sites
on Earth keep getting rebuilt,

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.260 align:middle line:84%
and there's your
answer right there.

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.565 align:middle line:84%
I was saying earlier
how the temples have

00:32:02.565 --> 00:32:04.990 align:middle line:90%
to be mirrors of the heavens.

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And yes, the Earth moves
relative to the background

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.640 align:middle line:84%
of the constellations
of one degree

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.910 align:middle line:84%
every 72 years, imperceptibly
in our lifetime.

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Over 26,000 years, when the
pole does its complete cycle,

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:18.510 align:middle line:90%
everything is now over here.

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:20.167 align:middle line:84%
So your temple is
no longer aligned

00:32:20.167 --> 00:32:21.750 align:middle line:84%
to the purpose for
which it was built.

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is why there's so
much disagreement about dates.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Because-- and taking the group
Great Pyramid as an example,

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.030 align:middle line:90%
well, read your Herodotus.

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.770 align:middle line:84%
This is another pyramid
underneath the Great Pyramid.

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:34.210 align:middle line:90%
There are chambers over there.

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And today, you can still go
to the underground chamber

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:39.100 align:middle line:84%
which is essentially the
top of the old pyramid.

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And then you go through
that into the new pyramid.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.489 align:middle line:84%
Well, they kept building and
rebuilding and rebuilding

00:32:43.489 --> 00:32:45.890 align:middle line:84%
and realigning the shaft
according to the starts

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:48.730 align:middle line:84%
that they wanted to
align to, to readjust

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:50.570 align:middle line:90%
the temple to its purpose.

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.040 align:middle line:90%
So that's part of the answer.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.890 align:middle line:84%
The temples are cut
to always realign

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:56.970 align:middle line:90%
throughout different ages.

00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Yucatan, the pyramid,
the magician Uxmal--

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's
the one I'm attracted to.

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: There's four different
pyramids inside the main one.

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:05.198 align:middle line:84%
You only see the outer
one because that's

00:33:05.198 --> 00:33:07.460 align:middle line:84%
reflecting the
alignment of Venus,

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:10.624 align:middle line:84%
which is what the Mayans
were basically honoring.

00:33:10.624 --> 00:33:13.040 align:middle line:84%
The ones before that are all
slightly misaligned in there,

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.520 align:middle line:84%
because they're doing
something very, very different.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:19.466 align:middle line:84%
Same thing at the oldest site
on Earth, which is Tiahuanaco.

00:33:19.466 --> 00:33:21.840 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it carefully
and you measure it carefully,

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.390 align:middle line:84%
it's just misaligned
by four degrees.

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:26.340 align:middle line:84%
All the older sites
around Tiahuanaco

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.110 align:middle line:90%
are misaligned by four degrees.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:30.050 align:middle line:84%
They're pointing to
something very different.

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:32.589 align:middle line:84%
It's just the equinox back
then was four degrees off.

00:33:32.589 --> 00:33:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Because they're supposed
to be places of balance.

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:35.610 align:middle line:90%
Balance is now off.

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what does that
do to your experience there?

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: You have
to adjust for it.

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.190 align:middle line:90%
You have to compensate for it.

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:42.597 align:middle line:90%
Tiahuanaco has being molested.

00:33:42.597 --> 00:33:45.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's been so much of
the stone that's been removed,

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:46.530 align:middle line:90%
blasted.

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Building stones have
been taken away.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.630 align:middle line:90%
It's powerful.

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:52.380 align:middle line:84%
If you go there, it
still feels potent,

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.120 align:middle line:90%
but something's missing.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.014 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
readjust the temple

00:33:56.014 --> 00:33:57.180 align:middle line:90%
with your own consciousness.

00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:00.430 align:middle line:84%
You have to go there
and almost in a way

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:02.580 align:middle line:84%
imagine what it was
like before them

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and synchronize
your consciousness

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:07.000 align:middle line:84%
with the original alignment
and bring the two together.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.440 align:middle line:90%
It requires effort.

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.304 align:middle line:84%
At 13,000 feet, it
requires a lot of effort.

00:34:11.304 --> 00:34:13.179 align:middle line:84%
When you do that, it's
as though you are also

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:14.928 align:middle line:84%
having a bit of an out
of body experience.

00:34:14.928 --> 00:34:17.389 align:middle line:84%
You begin to align with the
original purpose of the temple.

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And something very
magical happens,

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.370 align:middle line:84%
and I did that when
I was down there,

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:21.540 align:middle line:84%
just for a few
minutes, just to get

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:22.870 align:middle line:90%
a sense of what it was like.

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:25.199 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
then fill in the gap

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:27.275 align:middle line:84%
to feel what the original
temple was doing.

00:34:27.275 --> 00:34:28.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I wanted to know.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.030 align:middle line:84%
So you use your consciousness
to bridge the gap.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:33.600 align:middle line:84%
I've never been to-- do you
call it Ux-mal or Ush-mal?

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.245 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Ush-mal.

00:34:35.245 --> 00:34:37.139 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've
wanted to go there.

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:39.509 align:middle line:84%
What is your experience
at that spot?

00:34:39.509 --> 00:34:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: I'm really attracted
to the pyramid of the magician

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:42.929 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:44.595 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm about
to take a group there

00:34:44.595 --> 00:34:46.550 align:middle line:84%
in a couple of weeks
and I can't wait.

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:47.425 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:34:47.425 --> 00:34:49.542 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what is it
about that one?

00:34:49.542 --> 00:34:51.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I'm
attracted to it, because I

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:52.458 align:middle line:90%
haven't been there yet.

00:34:52.458 --> 00:34:53.506 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: It's funny.

00:34:53.506 --> 00:34:55.380 align:middle line:84%
It was like when I did
my first trip to Peru.

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.004 align:middle line:84%
And usually when I
lead groups, I never

00:34:57.004 --> 00:34:59.580 align:middle line:84%
go to places where I haven't
physically been to before,

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:02.540 align:middle line:84%
because I need to know not
just from head research,

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.980 align:middle line:84%
I need to get from practical
experience what's going on.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Peru and Yucatan
I've made allowances.

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:09.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:11.020 align:middle line:90%
I broke the rule.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:13.535 align:middle line:84%
And when I went down there,
I kept leading people

00:35:13.535 --> 00:35:15.910 align:middle line:84%
out of the bus, and people
were saying, where's he going?

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:17.580 align:middle line:90%
He hasn't been there.

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:18.830 align:middle line:90%
I know exactly what I'm going.

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:19.260 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.110 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.570 align:middle line:84%
I knew exactly
where everything was

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and I was talking as if
I'd been there 100 times.

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:25.590 align:middle line:90%
It was so familiar.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think this part of
the question, the equation.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:29.880 align:middle line:90%
I probably was there before.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm very intimate
with these places.

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:34.210 align:middle line:90%
And the magician is one of them.

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:35.770 align:middle line:90%
Tikal is another one.

00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:38.210 align:middle line:84%
I just feel very
comfortable at these places.

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:40.980 align:middle line:84%
But Teotihuacan, you
wouldn't pay me enough money

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:45.085 align:middle line:84%
to go there, probably because
of the atrocities that were done

00:35:45.085 --> 00:35:46.482 align:middle line:90%
around the time of the Aztecs.

00:35:46.482 --> 00:35:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And when you go to
these sites, you

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.609 align:middle line:84%
do become very sensitive
and sensitized to them,

00:35:50.609 --> 00:35:51.900 align:middle line:90%
and that's what I'm picking up.

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.275 align:middle line:84%
I just don't feel
right about it.

00:35:53.275 --> 00:35:54.941 align:middle line:84%
Not that there's
anything wrong with it,

00:35:54.941 --> 00:35:56.470 align:middle line:90%
but that's my resonance with it.

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:58.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't jive with it.

00:35:58.370 --> 00:36:01.607 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so bring it
up to modern culture now,

00:36:01.607 --> 00:36:03.190 align:middle line:84%
we will take what
you're talking about

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:04.564 align:middle line:84%
and kind of flip
it a little bit.

00:36:04.564 --> 00:36:07.020 align:middle line:84%
You talk a bit about
sick building syndrome.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.115 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
sick building syndrome.

00:36:09.115 --> 00:36:12.250 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: Complete inversion of
the principles of sacred space.

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:16.480 align:middle line:84%
So let's say we have a
building, sacred temple.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.030 align:middle line:90%
And it has its geometry.

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's designed to certain
geometrical principles

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:25.180 align:middle line:84%
to accommodate and facilitate
a certain frame of mind.

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And then it's built on the
electromagnetic frequencies

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.270 align:middle line:84%
which happened to be there
already on the Earth.

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And you have a certain
out of body experience

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.690 align:middle line:84%
or a certain
positive experience.

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:37.250 align:middle line:84%
With sick building syndrome,
you have the complete inversion,

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:42.320 align:middle line:84%
where people just seem to build
rooms to put cubicles in them

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:46.195 align:middle line:84%
and get as many bodies
into a space as you can.

00:36:46.195 --> 00:36:47.445 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Modern architecture.

00:36:47.445 --> 00:36:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: Modern
architecture, most of it.

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:53.450 align:middle line:84%
There are a few people I who
are using very sacred principles

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:55.660 align:middle line:84%
on which to build
modern office blocks.

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And they use things like the
golden ratio and pentagrams.

00:36:58.660 --> 00:36:59.610 align:middle line:90%
But when you look at--

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:01.026 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where
is this happening?

00:37:01.026 --> 00:37:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: In Boston, actually.

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:04.150 align:middle line:90%
Good friend of mine.

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:06.355 align:middle line:84%
And nobody wants to
leave those buildings.

00:37:06.355 --> 00:37:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't
want to go home at night.

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: And they don't want
to go home at night, which

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:10.616 align:middle line:90%
might not be a good thing.

00:37:10.616 --> 00:37:12.490 align:middle line:84%
But the whole point of
sick building syndrome

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:15.030 align:middle line:84%
is if you build a space and
you put a person inside it

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:17.550 align:middle line:84%
and that space is built
to non-sacred geometrical

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:19.430 align:middle line:84%
principles, or
principles that have

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:22.040 align:middle line:84%
no relationship with nature,
your body is out of sync

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.230 align:middle line:90%
with its environment.

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And the air that's
revolving around that space

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.930 align:middle line:90%
also is feeling that disconnect.

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:31.460 align:middle line:84%
So of course you've got
your body and dull air.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.030 align:middle line:84%
The two of them
don't go together.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And before you realize
it, you feel sick.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.375 align:middle line:84%
And the whole air in
the building feels sick.

00:37:37.375 --> 00:37:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And there is something
to be said about this.

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:40.999 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back to
what the Russians were

00:37:40.999 --> 00:37:42.490 align:middle line:90%
doing in the '50s and '60s.

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:45.180 align:middle line:84%
They said that energy just
seems to move much more

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:48.120 align:middle line:84%
freely and more actively
when you are in spaces

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.210 align:middle line:90%
which conform to natural laws.

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:51.277 align:middle line:90%
And they were right.

00:37:51.277 --> 00:37:52.985 align:middle line:84%
They were basically
going back and-- they

00:37:52.985 --> 00:37:54.640 align:middle line:90%
weren't reinventing the wheel.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.345 align:middle line:84%
They just went back and what
the ancients were doing.

00:37:56.345 --> 00:37:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
unfortunately, other

00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:59.911 align:middle line:84%
than your friend in Boston
and maybe a few other people

00:37:59.911 --> 00:38:05.030 align:middle line:84%
around the planet, the
developers and architects

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.370 align:middle line:84%
are pretty much
unconscious of this stuff.

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:09.460 align:middle line:84%
So how many people
are actually living

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:12.060 align:middle line:84%
in a supportive environment
for their energy field,

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:15.325 align:middle line:84%
no less for good sleep, good
dreams leaving the body?

00:38:15.325 --> 00:38:16.675 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Exactly.

00:38:16.675 --> 00:38:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very
seldom, I would think.

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:20.165 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: Well, we could
talk about feng shui

00:38:20.165 --> 00:38:23.190 align:middle line:84%
in that respect, about how
that is so important in China,

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:27.130 align:middle line:84%
or at least it used to be, to
facilitate wellness in people.

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And that also was done for
office buildings as well.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Put the building in a
certain location on the land.

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.574 align:middle line:84%
Give it a certain
geometric matrix.

00:38:34.574 --> 00:38:36.490 align:middle line:84%
You can never actually
figure out the geometry

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:37.439 align:middle line:90%
by looking at it.

00:38:37.439 --> 00:38:38.980 align:middle line:84%
You have to sit
there and dissect it,

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.650 align:middle line:84%
because to you and I
or the untrained eye,

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:43.570 align:middle line:84%
it still looks like
cubicles, but the cubicles

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:45.010 align:middle line:90%
look very different.

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Slightly different
elongated shapes,

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:49.270 align:middle line:84%
because there's an underlying
geometry behind it.

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:50.850 align:middle line:90%
It's hidden in plain view.

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, they still were using,
up to the end of the 1990s,

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:58.540 align:middle line:84%
a feng shui master that
would go to building sites

00:38:58.540 --> 00:38:59.960 align:middle line:84%
and find the right
conditions that

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:03.430 align:middle line:84%
were favorable for the benefit
of the people in the building

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and for the growth of
the business itself.

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:07.462 align:middle line:90%
So that's a very old concept.

00:39:07.462 --> 00:39:09.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you can still
find that in Rome.

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's really one
of the most important concepts

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.120 align:middle line:84%
of living on this
planet and being human,

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:18.260 align:middle line:84%
as long as we don't have fur
and require living indoors

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and caves aren't good enough,
is to reside in spaces that

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:23.610 align:middle line:90%
support health and well-being.

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:25.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's so rare.

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:28.920 align:middle line:84%
It's no wonder people feel
like they do-- generally,

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.290 align:middle line:90%
devitalized.

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:32.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people who live in the
country, rural areas, on farms

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:35.780 align:middle line:84%
and are outdoors a lot--
you see a different level

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:38.170 align:middle line:84%
vitality in these
people versus people

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:41.230 align:middle line:84%
in the city and
the suburbs, where

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:44.670 align:middle line:84%
the X factor that they don't
take into consideration

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:48.720 align:middle line:84%
after popping a Prozac
or whatever is that these

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.361 align:middle line:90%
are unhealthy places.

00:39:50.361 --> 00:39:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: I guess you have to
keep ingesting some blue water

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.255 align:middle line:90%
lily and some ergot.

00:39:54.255 --> 00:39:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Apparently.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: But it is true.

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Because things in
this day and age,

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.120 align:middle line:84%
they're done for convenience
rather than for sacredness.

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And once you've
lost that disconnect

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:06.860 align:middle line:84%
between the landscape and
the universe around you,

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:09.970 align:middle line:84%
you literally are living
a very disconnected life.

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:12.810 align:middle line:84%
It's not that difficult
really to grasp as a concept.

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:15.730 align:middle line:84%
If you're living in harmony
with your environment, which

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:18.760 align:middle line:84%
birthed you in the first
place, then obviously

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.310 align:middle line:84%
you are living outside
of space and time,

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:24.950 align:middle line:84%
which is operating on
principles which are endless,

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:26.831 align:middle line:90%
which are eternal.

00:40:26.831 --> 00:40:28.580 align:middle line:84%
You can't do any more
connected than that.

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:31.380 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't take that much
of a leap of imagination

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:34.490 align:middle line:84%
to argue the point that if
you're doing things based

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:37.275 align:middle line:84%
on natural law, then
obviously if you're

00:40:37.275 --> 00:40:39.400 align:middle line:84%
living by natural law, you
will lead a better life.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.156 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is a good time
for a feng shui advertisement.

00:40:42.156 --> 00:40:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Absolutely.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, if you're
living in a space that's just

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:47.267 align:middle line:84%
not working for you, the
least you can do is get a book

00:40:47.267 --> 00:40:49.600 align:middle line:84%
or hire someone that knows
how to do that kind of thing,

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.360 align:middle line:90%
I would assume.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.160 align:middle line:90%
It's worth it.

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Oh, absolutely.

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:55.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, after years
of looking at temples

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and going around
analyzing things,

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I began to teach
temple making classes

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:03.450 align:middle line:84%
and then also to show
people that you can actually

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:05.660 align:middle line:84%
take the principles
of, let's say,

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:08.190 align:middle line:84%
a pyramid or Stonehenge
or a cathedral

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and you can dissect them
down to their lowest

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:11.489 align:middle line:90%
common denominators.

00:41:11.489 --> 00:41:13.530 align:middle line:84%
They're actually quite
simple once you know them.

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:17.425 align:middle line:84%
It just takes you 15 years to
find out, which is what I do.

00:41:17.425 --> 00:41:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I will just teach,
in the matter of a day,

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:22.190 align:middle line:84%
how to take a basic
space just like this.

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:24.435 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of the day,
people are feeding energy.

00:41:24.435 --> 00:41:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually
falling over

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:27.600 align:middle line:90%
when we move energy around.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And you've turned a normal
space into a sacred space,

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:31.720 align:middle line:90%
just like that.

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And you can do that in
the living room, a house

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:34.580 align:middle line:90%
or a garden.

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.720 align:middle line:84%
And I've known people that
take these principles,

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.750 align:middle line:84%
they hardwire them
into their apartments

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:40.130 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of Chicago.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And they go, weird things
are happening around-- yes,

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:44.490 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't take that much.

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:48.810 align:middle line:84%
One guy even built a
temple across Nova Scotia,

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:53.210 align:middle line:84%
40 miles in diameter, built
a huge pentagram of temples.

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:54.720 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why did you do it?

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.220 align:middle line:84%
He said, well,
because there's a lot

00:41:56.220 --> 00:42:00.402 align:middle line:84%
of sick towns around there, a
lot of sickness in those towns.

00:42:00.402 --> 00:42:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And he's monitoring it and he's
saying, after I've actually

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:06.100 align:middle line:84%
built this temple that
encompasses these towns,

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.782 align:middle line:84%
somehow there seems to
be a change happening.

00:42:08.782 --> 00:42:11.240 align:middle line:84%
You don't get many people who
seem to be reporting sickness

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.610 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:14.120 align:middle line:90%
And they thought on a big scale.

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And people who still apply
the principles, which

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:19.290 align:middle line:84%
are very simple to
implement, by the way.

00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:21.080 align:middle line:84%
You don't really
large rocks to do it,

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.800 align:middle line:84%
unless you want to
build something that's

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.290 align:middle line:90%
going to last for a long time.

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:26.055 align:middle line:84%
You can use little
crystals that big.

00:42:26.055 --> 00:42:28.157 align:middle line:84%
Because part of the concept
is that you also use

00:42:28.157 --> 00:42:29.490 align:middle line:90%
the power of your consciousness.

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you can do
this inside a given space,

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:32.809 align:middle line:84%
like your living
room, for example,

00:42:32.809 --> 00:42:34.391 align:middle line:84%
build your little
temple in the middle

00:42:34.391 --> 00:42:35.720 align:middle line:90%
and it should shift the energy.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:36.225 align:middle line:90%
And it does.

00:42:36.225 --> 00:42:37.641 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: Same
rules of initiation

00:42:37.641 --> 00:42:38.960 align:middle line:90%
apply to the living room.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.810 align:middle line:84%
I've got one in my living
room in Portland, Maine.

00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:44.160 align:middle line:84%
People always sit
exactly the same position

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.182 align:middle line:90%
in my living room.

00:42:45.182 --> 00:42:46.140 align:middle line:90%
I don't even tell them.

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:47.671 align:middle line:90%
And they just feel good there.

00:42:47.671 --> 00:42:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're sitting inside
the middle of a pentagram

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:53.410 align:middle line:84%
that they can't see is hardwired
around the actual room.

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:56.115 align:middle line:84%
Very subtle, but they know there
is something special there.

00:42:56.115 --> 00:42:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's nice.

00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:58.470 align:middle line:90%
My house isn't so subtle.

00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:59.710 align:middle line:90%
It has a bhagwa.

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:02.690 align:middle line:84%
It has a pyramid in
the middle of it.

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:05.340 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of all
out energetically.

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:06.270 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:09.050 align:middle line:84%
People never want to leave,
and sometimes they don't.

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:11.700 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they stay for weeks
and even months at a time

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:15.090 align:middle line:90%
after coming for a week visit.

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:18.660 align:middle line:84%
It's crazy, but I remember this
one kid came in when I first

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:20.130 align:middle line:90%
bought the house in 2000.

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:27.230 align:middle line:84%
He was 16, just a kid, lanky,
and not necessarily-- he

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:28.100 align:middle line:90%
didn't meditate.

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:29.470 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness wasn't his bag.

00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:31.377 align:middle line:84%
He was into music
and other things.

00:43:31.377 --> 00:43:33.960 align:middle line:84%
But he walked in the house and
just stopped dead in its tracks

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:38.900 align:middle line:84%
and said, Dude, you
can breathe in here.

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And that was the best
endorsement ever,

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.480 align:middle line:84%
for the energy just
moving in the house.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And what a difference
between that.

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.810 align:middle line:84%
When I walk in spaces
that have bad energy,

00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:50.480 align:middle line:90%
I have to turn around and leave.

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.610 align:middle line:90%
I can't stand it.

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
was going to say.

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are the most
finely tuned instruments

00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:58.730 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
recognizing whether it's

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:00.950 align:middle line:84%
good energy or bad, if
we don't override it

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:04.150 align:middle line:84%
with the left side of the
brain and practical decisions

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:05.120 align:middle line:90%
and implications.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:08.540 align:middle line:84%
That's the first voice we should
listen to is, this feels bad.

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:09.340 align:middle line:90%
Walk out.

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:10.110 align:middle line:90%
Don't buy that house.

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:11.070 align:middle line:90%
Don't go to that apartment.

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:13.194 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: Yes your inner
tuition or your intuition,

00:44:13.194 --> 00:44:14.780 align:middle line:90%
as we call it.

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it
brings up the point

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.475 align:middle line:84%
with the whole process of
initiation, which literally

00:44:19.475 --> 00:44:21.700 align:middle line:84%
serves to shut down
your left brain

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.852 align:middle line:90%
and getting to the right brain.

00:44:23.852 --> 00:44:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Many people have
asked about things

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:29.560 align:middle line:84%
like, why is the sarcophagus
in the Great Pyramid?

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Why do I feel a certain way
when I go into certain places?

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:37.010 align:middle line:84%
So recent research found the
box inside the King's Chamber

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:39.870 align:middle line:84%
actually vibrates
around 112 Hertz.

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And the same frequency was also
found in other ritual chambers

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:47.020 align:middle line:84%
around Europe, one in Malta
called the House of Flieni,

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:51.140 align:middle line:84%
the Hypogeum, Newgrange in
Ireland-- all very different

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:54.300 align:middle line:84%
shapes, but they all have
this frequency of 112 Hertz.

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:56.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a frequency that shuts
down the prefrontal cortex

00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:57.800 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.760 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it
stops you thinking

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.914 align:middle line:90%
and moves you to the right side.

00:45:01.914 --> 00:45:04.080 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it gets you
to start feeling things.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.410 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly the
first thing that you

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:07.340 align:middle line:84%
want to do when you're
going to an initiation.

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:08.140 align:middle line:90%
You want to feel.

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.170 align:middle line:84%
You can't think your way
through an initiation.

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly and very
quickly, we suddenly

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.290 align:middle line:84%
are aware that these buildings,
where no one was ever buried,

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:17.530 align:middle line:90%
what they were there for.

00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:21.440 align:middle line:84%
They were used to let you have
an out of body experience.

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:23.680 align:middle line:84%
So same thing for the
Hypogeum in Malta.

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:26.200 align:middle line:84%
You go in there, and in
fact I was going through

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:29.970 align:middle line:84%
with a tour group and
there was a woman--

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:32.930 align:middle line:84%
these things happen totally
by coincidence-- where

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:33.952 align:middle line:90%
pulls me aside.

00:45:33.952 --> 00:45:35.410 align:middle line:84%
She didn't know I
was a researcher.

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And she says, you know, I really
like being in this chamber.

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:41.737 align:middle line:84%
Of all the 33 chambers
in this underground room,

00:45:41.737 --> 00:45:43.070 align:middle line:90%
this is the one I want to be in.

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:44.410 align:middle line:90%
So what happens?

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, people go away and
they just start singing.

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:49.530 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm going
into sort of state,

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:51.210 align:middle line:90%
but I'm going out of the body.

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:54.700 align:middle line:84%
She had no idea that was the
actual resonant spot where

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:58.217 align:middle line:84%
the researchers have
measured the frequency.

00:45:58.217 --> 00:45:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
they did the rituals.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.758 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they call it
the bridal chamber, where

00:46:01.758 --> 00:46:03.980 align:middle line:90%
the initiate married his bride.

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:08.100 align:middle line:84%
He came in contact with a divine
virgin and they became one.

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's where they
consumed the cosmic marriage

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.670 align:middle line:84%
and then the soul came
back into the body.

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So now we know that these
places were built and hardwired.

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And acoustics
were really important.

00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:20.450 align:middle line:84%
The frequency ranges
you're talking about

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:24.450 align:middle line:84%
were-- that was really critical
to what happened in those.

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Crucial.

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Gothic cathedrals
are a great example,

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:31.110 align:middle line:84%
because they are
hardwired to take

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:33.170 align:middle line:90%
in the Gregorian plain chant.

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:37.606 align:middle line:84%
And when you stand up in a
Gothic cathedral, which again,

00:46:37.606 --> 00:46:39.480 align:middle line:84%
they built on top of
the ancient sacred sites

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.962 align:middle line:84%
which are used for
these practices,

00:46:41.962 --> 00:46:44.130 align:middle line:84%
built by the Templars
and Cistercians

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:46.360 align:middle line:84%
who brought this information
from the Middle East.

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And you stand up as an antenna,
with your spine upright

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:53.580 align:middle line:84%
in the nave, and you
put Gregorian music

00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:57.000 align:middle line:84%
into the Gothic cathedral,
the pop music of its day.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, when they measure
your brain wave frequencies,

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:02.850 align:middle line:84%
you're going 4,000% above
normal waking state.

00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:04.830 align:middle line:84%
So you're already
having an out of body

00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:07.360 align:middle line:84%
experience just by
standing there, listening

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.160 align:middle line:90%
to this frequency.

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.470 align:middle line:84%
So the building is
accentuating the frequencies

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:12.776 align:middle line:84%
and Gregorian plain
chant and getting

00:47:12.776 --> 00:47:13.900 align:middle line:90%
you to have that stimulant.

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.233 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No wonder people
have that incredibly heavenly

00:47:16.233 --> 00:47:17.615 align:middle line:90%
experience listening to that.

00:47:17.615 --> 00:47:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: Exactly, without
religion coming into it.

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Without.

00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:22.023 align:middle line:84%
And hey, I just read
something the other day

00:47:22.023 --> 00:47:25.510 align:middle line:84%
I thought was a wonderful
little modern overlay to this.

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:27.300 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
who write are known

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:28.790 align:middle line:90%
for writing in coffee shops.

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:30.025 align:middle line:90%
It's just a thing, right?

00:47:30.025 --> 00:47:31.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you do, but I do.

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.260 align:middle line:84%
I've written so many--
hundreds of scripts

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:36.970 align:middle line:84%
in coffee shops
and a couple books.

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:38.760 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, what is it?

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Why is it, if I'm in
the silence of my home,

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:43.280 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't work the same?

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.590 align:middle line:84%
This article said
that din, where

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:48.020 align:middle line:84%
you have low level
conversation going on,

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:50.230 align:middle line:84%
the espresso maker doing
its thing here and there,

00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:52.830 align:middle line:84%
though that would
be a spike, creates

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:55.860 align:middle line:84%
an average of a 70
Hertz frequency, which

00:47:55.860 --> 00:48:00.360 align:middle line:84%
is the beginning of kicking
aside the rational mind

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:04.600 align:middle line:84%
and allowing the creative,
right side of the brain

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.040 align:middle line:90%
to begin igniting.

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.300 align:middle line:84%
It's just a distraction enough
of the left side of the brain.

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:11.590 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: So Hunter Thompson
was right by listening

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:15.050 align:middle line:90%
to white noise on television.

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and Mario
Puzo writing "The Godfather"

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:21.150 align:middle line:84%
at Cafe Trieste, a lot of
espresso happening there.

00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:23.430 align:middle line:84%
But I thought that
was fascinating,

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:25.070 align:middle line:84%
because I've talked
with other writers,

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:27.790 align:middle line:84%
and everyone wonders, how come I
get more done at a coffee shop?

00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:28.590 align:middle line:90%
That's why.

00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:29.500 align:middle line:90%
We now have an answer.

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:30.915 align:middle line:84%
It's this thing
we're talking about.

00:48:30.915 --> 00:48:31.475 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: It's resonance.

00:48:31.475 --> 00:48:32.590 align:middle line:90%
It's matching one to the other.

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:34.715 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't work with
everybody, but many people who

00:48:34.715 --> 00:48:37.180 align:middle line:84%
are tied into that resonance,
you finding a like resonance

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.280 align:middle line:90%
and it's triggering something.

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:42.244 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I do the same
thing with standing stones.

00:48:42.244 --> 00:48:44.660 align:middle line:84%
People keep talking to me about
going and doing ayahusaca,

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and I'm thinking, I
don't need to lose

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:50.520 align:middle line:90%
control of my body functions.

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing I see when
I leave the body are brightly

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:53.880 align:middle line:90%
colored snakes.

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:55.480 align:middle line:90%
I can't stand snakes.

00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:57.230 align:middle line:84%
I can get a much
better effect standing

00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:59.240 align:middle line:84%
next to a large upright
rock in a stone circle.

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.762 align:middle line:84%
And I can just download
information from there,

00:49:01.762 --> 00:49:02.845 align:middle line:90%
because it's my resonance.

00:49:02.845 --> 00:49:04.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's your resonance.

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Of your resonance, standing
stones, Avebury You

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:09.095 align:middle line:84%
say it is a particle
accelerator.

00:49:09.095 --> 00:49:11.320 align:middle line:84%
It acts like a
particle accelerator.

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:12.340 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:14.400 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have been and
would like to go to Avebury.

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: Oh, well, I
take about four groups

00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:17.630 align:middle line:90%
there a year for good reason.

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:19.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a great experience because
it's a landscape temple.

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:20.490 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:21.823 align:middle line:90%
You get to walk the whole thing.

00:49:21.823 --> 00:49:22.635 align:middle line:90%
A good fit.

00:49:22.635 --> 00:49:24.610 align:middle line:84%
I like that there's
a pub in the center.

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:27.695 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, a lovely pub.

00:49:27.695 --> 00:49:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: And it is.

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:31.500 align:middle line:84%
They found that-- it's
a huge stone circle.

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:33.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the world's
biggest stone circle.

00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:34.580 align:middle line:84%
It has two avenues,
or at least it

00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:37.040 align:middle line:84%
did before the Puritans
knocked most of them down.

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.770 align:middle line:84%
But there's enough
still there to get

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:40.090 align:middle line:90%
a sense of what it feels like.

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's marking all the Earth's
electromagnetic energies.

00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:47.110 align:middle line:84%
But each one of the stones,
when you look at them carefully,

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:49.570 align:middle line:84%
they seem to be formed
in different shapes,

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:52.260 align:middle line:84%
alternating shapes, like
a masculine and feminine.

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So there's a phallus and a
big sort of Earth mother shape

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.610 align:middle line:90%
next to it.

00:49:57.610 --> 00:50:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that the
inside of the actual stones

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.370 align:middle line:84%
is moved towards the
center of the avenue.

00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:06.920 align:middle line:84%
The magnetic field of the
stones has a push-pull effect.

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.700 align:middle line:84%
So when you're walking down
the avenue into the temple,

00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:12.020 align:middle line:84%
you're going from left
to right, left to right,

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:13.420 align:middle line:90%
left brain to right brain.

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:15.600 align:middle line:84%
By the time you reach
the stone circle,

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:17.516 align:middle line:84%
you've gone for a labyrinth
and you're already

00:50:17.516 --> 00:50:19.680 align:middle line:84%
feeling like you're slightly
out of phase and time.

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
is, is that Avebury

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:24.210 align:middle line:84%
is positioned at a
certain part of the Earth

00:50:24.210 --> 00:50:26.555 align:middle line:84%
where the frequencies
as such that

00:50:26.555 --> 00:50:29.390 align:middle line:84%
at dawn, the temple
itself by design

00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:32.370 align:middle line:84%
starts to soak up the
local electromagnetic field

00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:33.170 align:middle line:90%
around it.

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And it draws it in
through its entrance.

00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:39.200 align:middle line:84%
So the frequency going in
through the entrance of Avebury

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:42.080 align:middle line:84%
is about something like
10 times what it should

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:45.170 align:middle line:90%
be compared to local field.

00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:47.200 align:middle line:84%
So as you're actually
there at dawn,

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.150 align:middle line:84%
just before the sun
clips the horizon,

00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:50.830 align:middle line:84%
there's this whoosh
that goes in there.

00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:53.790 align:middle line:84%
It goes around the
ditch which used

00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:55.935 align:middle line:84%
to be filled with
water, which again water

00:50:55.935 --> 00:50:58.940 align:middle line:84%
and magnetism create a
wonderful electrical charge.

00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And just as the sun clips the
horizon, bang, the whole thing

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:05.920 align:middle line:84%
goes into the stone circle and
the entire thing comes alive.

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's literally a
living, breathing organism.

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And it slowly dies down
towards the evening.

00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:14.220 align:middle line:84%
The energy goes down, and
it begins again at dawn.

00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:16.106 align:middle line:90%
Same thing in Carnac, in France.

00:51:16.106 --> 00:51:17.480 align:middle line:84%
There was an
electrical engineer,

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:20.100 align:middle line:84%
measured all the standing
stones, measured the stone

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.430 align:middle line:90%
circles.

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And he came to the conclusion as
a skeptic, that yes, it's true.

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:29.260 align:middle line:84%
The temples by design behave
like a coil or a battery

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:31.910 align:middle line:84%
or an accumulator
and they recharge

00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:34.380 align:middle line:84%
and that they soak up the
energy of the landscape

00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:36.880 align:middle line:84%
every 18 minutes or so
and then discharge it

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:37.990 align:middle line:90%
throughout the day.

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's always much more
intense towards the dawn

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:42.160 align:middle line:90%
as it is towards the dusk.

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:44.570 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking to a
living, breathing organism.

00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is interfacing
with the sun's magnetic bursts,

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:50.500 align:middle line:90%
you're saying?

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:51.583 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: And it does too.

00:51:51.583 --> 00:51:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what,
every eight minutes?

00:51:54.070 --> 00:51:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that, how
those two work together.

00:51:56.810 --> 00:52:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: Yeah, there's a
solar wind that basically rises

00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:03.630 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the night and
then it reaches a crescendo

00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:06.770 align:middle line:84%
just before dawn and as
it's reaching a crescendo,

00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:12.070 align:middle line:84%
it suddenly sinks to the
Earth's electromagnetic field

00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:14.156 align:middle line:90%
as well, the terrestrial field.

00:52:14.156 --> 00:52:15.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's like something
from the heavens

00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:18.000 align:middle line:84%
actually interacts with
the Earth's energy field,

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.540 align:middle line:84%
and the two begin to actually
accelerate, just before dawn.

00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
temples all come alive,

00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:26.100 align:middle line:84%
which is funny because
the Egyptian priests

00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:29.880 align:middle line:84%
back in the old days used to go
around just before dawn, waking

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.410 align:middle line:84%
each part of the
temple as though

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:34.240 align:middle line:90%
rousing it being from sleep.

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.450 align:middle line:90%
The temple is a living being.

00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:36.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a god.

00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:37.920 align:middle line:90%
You have to rouse it from sleep.

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And the consciousness,
as we walk around temple,

00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:41.890 align:middle line:90%
helps the process.

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:43.800 align:middle line:90%
So they weren't mad.

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.635 align:middle line:84%
They were actually
eliciting the process.

00:52:45.635 --> 00:52:46.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:50.590 align:middle line:84%
A quick question on Avebury
before we leave Avebury.

00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Were there mating
rituals and things

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:54.110 align:middle line:84%
that happened in
that wide open circle

00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:56.350 align:middle line:84%
at certain times of the
year, Beltane and all that?

00:52:56.350 --> 00:52:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever heard
anyone talk about that?

00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:01.644 align:middle line:84%
I'm just asking, because
back in the day--

00:53:01.644 --> 00:53:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: That's true, yeah.

00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:04.760 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I'm asking
because when I went there,

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.384 align:middle line:10%
my husband at the
time, Scott Meredith,

00:53:06.384 --> 00:53:08.160 align:middle line:10%
we were sitting
down in the grass

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:11.150 align:middle line:10%
and just started to meditate,
and that's immediately--

00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:13.430 align:middle line:10%
that was the first
thing he saw was this

00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:15.300 align:middle line:10%
being used for mating rituals.

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: It's a Celtic wheel.

00:53:16.690 --> 00:53:20.150 align:middle line:84%
The whole of Avebury, if you
can imagine this cup is Avebury.

00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:23.110 align:middle line:10%
And then you have
from above, there

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:24.770 align:middle line:10%
are eight other
temples around it.

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:26.040 align:middle line:90%
So it's a compass.

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And depending on the
time of year, so Beltane,

00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:33.430 align:middle line:84%
or even the southeast quadrant,
which of course is the winter

00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:36.800 align:middle line:84%
solstice sunrise when fertility
comes back into the land,

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:38.320 align:middle line:84%
those would be the
two prime moments

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:41.200 align:middle line:84%
when fertility festivals would
be done there, specifically

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:45.410 align:middle line:84%
at Beltane, when the
burgeoning light of spring, you

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:46.830 align:middle line:90%
want to give it that extra push.

00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:49.230 align:middle line:10%
So again, people's
consciousness would also

00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:50.995 align:middle line:10%
interact with that
earthly consciousness.

00:53:50.995 --> 00:53:54.825 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Raising
the-- possibility--

00:53:54.825 --> 00:53:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Absolutely.

00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:58.480 align:middle line:90%
People, and was living there.

00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.920 align:middle line:90%
I used to see--

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People
sneak out at night?

00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:05.789 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: I'd catch the
farmers hiding behind bushes

00:54:05.789 --> 00:54:07.830 align:middle line:84%
with binoculars watching
naked women jumping over

00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:11.430 align:middle line:84%
sacred flames on hills
in specific parts

00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:14.470 align:middle line:84%
of southern Britain, where
for the past 4,000 years,

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:17.692 align:middle line:84%
the Beltane ritual was
and still is performed.

00:54:17.692 --> 00:54:19.150 align:middle line:84%
So it's quite funny,
but yeah, it's

00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:21.370 align:middle line:84%
still on it's very
day for that reason.

00:54:21.370 --> 00:54:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
another question.

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:25.390 align:middle line:84%
We only have about
five minutes left.

00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:28.230 align:middle line:84%
One thing that's often not
addressed is the pyramids.

00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:30.310 align:middle line:84%
As you say, most
of these sites were

00:54:30.310 --> 00:54:32.240 align:middle line:84%
built on top of
previous sites that

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:36.530 align:middle line:84%
are 20, 30, 40,000 years buried
in the sand, or 5,000 years.

00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:39.164 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't
necessarily mean

00:54:39.164 --> 00:54:41.330 align:middle line:84%
that these pyramids and
these sites around the earth

00:54:41.330 --> 00:54:44.400 align:middle line:84%
are inactive just because
they're under the sands, right?

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:45.330 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: No.

00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:46.450 align:middle line:90%
They're still beating.

00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that
really keeps them going

00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:52.660 align:middle line:84%
is your attention
and your intention.

00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:54.810 align:middle line:84%
So just because you
live 3,000 miles away

00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:57.240 align:middle line:84%
from a pyramid or
any sacred site

00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:59.210 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean you can't
interact with it.

00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Because this defies
time and space.

00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:04.780 align:middle line:84%
You send your thought, your
attention, your intention

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:06.830 align:middle line:84%
to a certain location,
even a person,

00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:09.016 align:middle line:90%
and you can stimulate that.

00:55:09.016 --> 00:55:10.140 align:middle line:90%
It's like watering a plant.

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.270 align:middle line:90%
You're giving it energy.

00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:14.712 align:middle line:84%
You've trying to give it the
energy it needs to keep going.

00:55:14.712 --> 00:55:16.420 align:middle line:84%
So yes, it's a wonderful
thing to connect

00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:19.850 align:middle line:84%
with things which are far away,
because it keeps them alive.

00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:21.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
just gross matter,

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:24.860 align:middle line:84%
what we're dealing with here in
terms of initiation practices,

00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:27.660 align:middle line:84%
and mystical practices
exist beyond time and space.

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:29.930 align:middle line:90%
It's just atoms in free flow.

00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:33.329 align:middle line:84%
You forget about the
physicalness of their nature.

00:55:33.329 --> 00:55:35.120 align:middle line:84%
They're just there to
catch your attention.

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:37.950 align:middle line:84%
The size and scale is
just to get your attention

00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:39.780 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that
if you lost a plot,

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:41.880 align:middle line:90%
this is where you come to.

00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:44.216 align:middle line:84%
You can sit quite happily
in a room and just projects

00:55:44.216 --> 00:55:45.840 align:middle line:84%
to these places and
get the information

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:47.790 align:middle line:90%
flowing backwards and forwards.

00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:49.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the
Persians and the Hopi

00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:52.580 align:middle line:84%
had the same concept for
their sacred spaces and even

00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:53.480 align:middle line:90%
sacred mountains.

00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:56.150 align:middle line:84%
They said that they're
connected to the heavens,

00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:58.610 align:middle line:84%
to the bottom of the earth,
and to the middle world

00:55:58.610 --> 00:55:59.910 align:middle line:90%
by a hollow reed.

00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:03.695 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny that in 2008,
NASA discovered that yes, there

00:56:03.695 --> 00:56:04.495 align:middle line:90%
are portals.

00:56:04.495 --> 00:56:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And they used the word
"portals" of energy

00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:10.330 align:middle line:84%
that open every eight minutes
that link the Earth to the sun.

00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I was referring

00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:12.310 align:middle line:90%
to earlier, absolutely.

00:56:12.310 --> 00:56:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: And that's, I believe,
is what the ancestors picked up

00:56:14.570 --> 00:56:14.820 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Because they could see
this stuff very easily.

00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:17.629 align:middle line:90%
They were connected to nature.

00:56:17.629 --> 00:56:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And they would
recognize these signs.

00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:20.725 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it looks
like a hollow reed.

00:56:20.725 --> 00:56:21.766 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: It really does.

00:56:21.766 --> 00:56:22.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a real portal.

00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:24.455 align:middle line:84%
And it connects to
the creative source,

00:56:24.455 --> 00:56:27.470 align:middle line:84%
and it goes to the middle world
where you interact with it,

00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:29.130 align:middle line:90%
and then you'd also leave.

00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:32.200 align:middle line:84%
So it's a wonderful way
to go out of the body

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.120 align:middle line:84%
and allow the spirit
world to come in.

00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So aside from
refining our spaces,

00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:38.784 align:middle line:84%
employing a little feng
shui, building your temples

00:56:38.784 --> 00:56:40.200 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
our living rooms,

00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:42.660 align:middle line:84%
bedrooms, and so forth,
another missing piece

00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:46.080 align:middle line:84%
which a lot of these
sites are really based on

00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:48.320 align:middle line:90%
is connection with the sun.

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: It's basically--
and the stars as well.

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:53.140 align:middle line:84%
They're always
talking about the sun

00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:56.460 align:middle line:84%
as the center of the universe
or a combustive source

00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:58.870 align:middle line:90%
from where everything emanates.

00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:01.860 align:middle line:84%
That's just on a
physical, visual level.

00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:03.000 align:middle line:90%
It goes beyond that.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.290 align:middle line:90%
It goes to stars as well.

00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Because you talk to so
many indigenous cultures,

00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:08.280 align:middle line:84%
and you think, well,
why do the Dogon

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.340 align:middle line:90%
believe in this Sirius system?

00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Why did the Hopi
have this fascination

00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:17.300 align:middle line:84%
with Orion and Sirius and Venus
in the southern hemisphere?

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's because
each one of them

00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:21.740 align:middle line:84%
was apparently considered to
be imbued with a certain energy

00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:22.814 align:middle line:90%
and frequency.

00:57:22.814 --> 00:57:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And you drew on
that for something

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:26.170 align:middle line:84%
that you required
in your daily life.

00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So everything in the
universe was alive.

00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Whatever was up
there was perfect.

00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And by drawing on that energy,
putting it on the ground,

00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:34.440 align:middle line:90%
you interact with it.

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you take
part into your life

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:38.572 align:middle line:90%
and you become as that energy.

00:57:38.572 --> 00:57:40.530 align:middle line:84%
So you can live consciously,
not just on Earth,

00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:43.220 align:middle line:84%
but you also connect with
much finer levels of reality.

00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, final question--
so if people are listening

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:49.670 align:middle line:84%
to this and they're excited
about potentials of discovering

00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:51.420 align:middle line:84%
themselves, what
are your top three,

00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:55.260 align:middle line:84%
would you consider the top
three currently most potent

00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:56.250 align:middle line:90%
places to go?

00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:57.746 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Oh my God.

00:57:57.746 --> 00:57:59.975 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I know I'm
narrowing you down a lot,

00:57:59.975 --> 00:58:02.100 align:middle line:84%
because each one is a
different kind of experience.

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And you can even label it as
such, but top three big ones.

00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: It depends
where you are in life.

00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:08.810 align:middle line:90%
I've come to that conclusion.

00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:11.315 align:middle line:84%
I used to have my top
three as being big places.

00:58:11.315 --> 00:58:13.890 align:middle line:84%
I actually find some of the
smaller places do it for me

00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:14.905 align:middle line:90%
these days.

00:58:14.905 --> 00:58:18.730 align:middle line:84%
I've just been to Callanish in
the Isle of Lewis in Scotland.

00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:21.090 align:middle line:84%
I've been to a lot of places,
and for the first time

00:58:21.090 --> 00:58:23.710 align:middle line:84%
I actually saw stones
moving and talking back

00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:24.595 align:middle line:90%
to me effortlessly.

00:58:24.595 --> 00:58:26.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're taking
people there too now.

00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>FREDDY: And I'm taking
people there for that reason,

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:30.690 align:middle line:84%
because they're so
unpolluted by human thought.

00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:32.540 align:middle line:90%
They're so pure.

00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:35.750 align:middle line:10%
There's the Chilpas in
South America, the towers,

00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:38.380 align:middle line:10%
unusual towers, where
no one's really buried.

00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:40.470 align:middle line:10%
I did a ceremony
there with 20 people,

00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:43.630 align:middle line:10%
and I tell you, we left,
came back and went,

00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:44.910 align:middle line:10%
that was interesting.

00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And it never ceases
to surprise me.

00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's bound to
your personal frequency.

00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is that
you resonate with,

00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:53.099 align:middle line:84%
and whatever calls you
at the moment, do it.

00:58:53.099 --> 00:58:55.640 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the place where
you want to be at that moment.

00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:56.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:58:56.190 --> 00:58:58.190 align:middle line:84%
The thing that gets you
juiced up and calls you,

00:58:58.190 --> 00:59:01.850 align:middle line:90%
like Uxmal's calling me.

00:59:01.850 --> 00:59:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Freddy, thank you
so much as always.

00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:05.882 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're continuing
to progress the themes.

00:59:05.882 --> 00:59:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't get to everything
in this conversation,

00:59:08.090 --> 00:59:10.850 align:middle line:84%
so we'll be talking again in
another six months from now.

00:59:10.850 --> 00:59:12.355 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY: Absolutely.

00:59:12.355 --> 00:59:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As always, Freddy
activates the salivary glands

00:59:15.570 --> 00:59:16.370 align:middle line:90%
of adventure.

00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:18.134 align:middle line:84%
You can connect with
his tours and books

00:59:18.134 --> 00:59:19.300 align:middle line:90%
through invisibletemple.com.

00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:23.600 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."

00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:29.741 align:middle line:90%
