[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:10.437 --> 00:00:28.672 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.672 --> 00:00:30.630 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: I've
found, throughout life,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.140 align:middle line:10%
I'm more inspired by a person
who has been through hell

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.000 align:middle line:10%
and recovered themselves
than I am by a saint.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.470 align:middle line:84%
The courage and
fortitude that it

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.750 align:middle line:84%
takes to recover
one's soul from prison

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.880 align:middle line:90%
is another order of magnitude.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Kenny Johnson was
a repeat offender

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.490 align:middle line:84%
serving a 40-year sentence
when he first came

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.400 align:middle line:90%
into the presence of Gangaji.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Feeling truly seen and accepted
for perhaps the first time

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.370 align:middle line:84%
in his life, his
reality took a u-turn

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.320 align:middle line:84%
to a life of meditation and
contemplation and helping

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.120 align:middle line:90%
others.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.734 align:middle line:90%
Kenny is with us today.

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:00.900 align:middle line:90%
It's good to see you, Kenny.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.307 align:middle line:90%
I met you first a few years ago.

00:01:02.307 --> 00:01:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>KENNY JOHNSON: Yeah,
2010, I think it was.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Something like that.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:84%
You're a slimmer Kenny today
and a married Kenny today.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.230 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: A married
Kenny and slimmer Kenny.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.730 align:middle line:10%
Married life does that to you.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.250 align:middle line:10%


00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.109 align:middle line:10%
When I met my wife, Pilar,
I was chubby, she said.

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but
you gave the best hugs.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yes.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.618 align:middle line:10%
She still says,
when you hugged me,

00:01:22.618 --> 00:01:25.090 align:middle line:10%
you were like a bear hugging me.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.680 align:middle line:90%
She said, now, you're "flaco."

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.480 align:middle line:90%
You're real thin.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:90%
I can hug you.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is true.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.781 align:middle line:84%
So Kenny, before we
begin this, we're

00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:36.790 align:middle line:90%
doing a three-part story here.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.895 align:middle line:84%
And we have Doug Noll, who has
the project, Prison of Peace,

00:01:40.895 --> 00:01:43.600 align:middle line:84%
who has talked about ways
in which we can listen

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.230 align:middle line:84%
to each other very deeply
to resolve conflict, boom,

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.460 align:middle line:90%
within seconds.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.150 align:middle line:90%
And it really does work.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And with your
story, I want to get

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.280 align:middle line:84%
a whole different
perspective on it,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.470 align:middle line:84%
what it's like, how life
unfolds that you find yourself

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.310 align:middle line:90%
in this situation.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.060 align:middle line:84%
We'll go into a lot
of different elements,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.000 align:middle line:84%
including the
psychology of what you

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000 align:middle line:84%
found inside with the
other prisoners as well.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, up
through your Gangaji story.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.410 align:middle line:84%
But I want to start with
your life as a little kid.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Right.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.290 align:middle line:84%
As a young man, I was raised
in Star City, Arkansas.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And as a young man, I would
say, Regina, from the age of 0

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.930 align:middle line:84%
to the age around
7 to 8, my life

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:90%
was like any other young child.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.239 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened was
as I was getting older--

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But let's
back it up a bit.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.850 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
something over lunch.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:44.814 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Right.

00:02:44.814 --> 00:02:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There
were seven of you.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.354 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Mm-hmm, seven
of us in the family.

00:02:48.354 --> 00:02:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
what it was like as little kids

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.020 align:middle line:90%
with-- it was kind of chaotic.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, very chaotic.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:03.600 align:middle line:84%
What happened was my
mother and my grandmother

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.309 align:middle line:84%
and my aunt was the main
people that raised me.

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:07.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What happened to Dad?

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Dad never
was in the scene.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.740 align:middle line:84%
My mother got pregnant,
and my father at that time

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.540 align:middle line:90%
disowned me.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.360 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, he's not my child.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.325 align:middle line:90%
Done.

00:03:19.325 --> 00:03:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And so that was, I
guess, my first wound,

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.435 align:middle line:90%
because my father was not there.

00:03:27.435 --> 00:03:30.827 align:middle line:84%
And so when I came out,
there was just my mom,

00:03:30.827 --> 00:03:32.660 align:middle line:84%
and like I said, my
aunt and my grandmother.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.294 align:middle line:90%
And I was raised by them.

00:03:34.294 --> 00:03:36.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But your mom
had her own challenges.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.751 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: She had
her own challenges

00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:40.770 align:middle line:84%
because, at that time,
it was me, Cynthia,

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.070 align:middle line:90%
and then there was three of us.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.470 align:middle line:84%
We were living In Arkansas,
and she was picking cotton back

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.040 align:middle line:90%
in the early '50s.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And so she and my aunt had
moved to migrate to Kansas City.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.840 align:middle line:90%
So my aunt says, come up north.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And so my mother went up north,
but I stayed in the south

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.710 align:middle line:90%
with my grandma.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.119 align:middle line:90%
And that's when--

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:05.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How was that for you?

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.609 align:middle line:84%
Because your dad wasn't there,
and when your mom went--

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.025 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: I was happy because
it was just me and Grandma.

00:04:11.025 --> 00:04:13.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, well you
were the apple of her eye?

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: I was the
apple of her eye.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So those
are the glory days.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: That was great.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.470 align:middle line:90%
That's what I said.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.430 align:middle line:84%
At that time, they
were the glory days.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.880 align:middle line:84%
After that, Regina, it
was like in those movies,

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.931 align:middle line:84%
a dark shadow came
over our house.

00:04:28.931 --> 00:04:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was
that dark shadow?

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And that was the
thief, the criminal nature

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.920 align:middle line:90%
that just came.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.812 align:middle line:84%
And I started stealing
and taking and--

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before
we go there, let's

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.000 align:middle line:84%
go into the beginning bits,
because you were actually

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.590 align:middle line:84%
a sensitive young man, a
good-natured man, a boy in love

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.410 align:middle line:90%
with the two girls.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.220 align:middle line:90%
I love this story.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.490 align:middle line:84%
You've got to tell it,
because it all started

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:55.680 align:middle line:90%
seemingly innocently enough.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: It was.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.970 align:middle line:90%
It was all innocent.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.636 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you
were a little kid,

00:04:58.636 --> 00:05:00.950 align:middle line:84%
and you wanted to do
something nice for Peaches

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.705 align:middle line:90%
and Pumpkin, these two girls.

00:05:02.705 --> 00:05:05.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: How
you remember that?

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.860 align:middle line:84%
It's right, because that is
how the wanting to please

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Peaches and Pumpkin,
it wasn't sinister.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.040 align:middle line:84%
It was just I was
wanting to have money

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.200 align:middle line:90%
to buy candy for the girls.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.740 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
they liked sweets.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.018 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: They liked
sweets and I like sweets.

00:05:24.018 --> 00:05:25.614 align:middle line:90%


00:05:25.614 --> 00:05:26.780 align:middle line:90%
And so that's how I started.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And so, over the days
and weeks and months,

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.780 align:middle line:84%
I had been taking quarters
and nickels and dimes

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.226 align:middle line:90%
from my aunt's coin purse.

00:05:35.226 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:84%
But then I get
there one morning,

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:84%
and there's no nickels
and dimes there.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.250 align:middle line:90%
There's only greens.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.210 align:middle line:90%
So I took a green paper--

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bill.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.926 align:middle line:90%
Whatever the bill was.

00:05:44.926 --> 00:05:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Whatever it was.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.288 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to buy some
candy again with the girls.

00:05:48.288 --> 00:05:52.136 align:middle line:84%
And I get to the store, and I
said, give them what they want,

00:05:52.136 --> 00:05:53.010 align:middle line:90%
and give me my usual.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.640 align:middle line:90%


00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.845 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Big man, big man.

00:05:56.845 --> 00:05:58.626 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Big man on campus.

00:05:58.626 --> 00:06:00.042 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give
Peaches and Pumpkin

00:06:00.042 --> 00:06:00.866 align:middle line:90%
whatever candy they want.

00:06:00.866 --> 00:06:01.278 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Whatever they want.

00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:02.078 align:middle line:90%
It's on me.

00:06:02.078 --> 00:06:05.572 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.572 --> 00:06:06.530 align:middle line:90%
All the candy is on me.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.242 align:middle line:90%


00:06:09.242 --> 00:06:10.721 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, go ahead.

00:06:10.721 --> 00:06:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Oh, god.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And so, what happened
was the store owner,

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.220 align:middle line:90%
he says, here's the change.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And I saw all these
greens and change,

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.094 align:middle line:90%
and I said, [GASPS] uh-oh.

00:06:25.094 --> 00:06:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you didn't
know the value of paper money

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:28.310 align:middle line:90%
yet.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, coins were to you, as
a little kid, what had value.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: But paper money,
I didn't know the value.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.182 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I got
in trouble, because I

00:06:35.182 --> 00:06:36.140 align:middle line:90%
didn't know what to do.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And Peaches and
Pumpkin, they saw it,

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.770 align:middle line:84%
and they-- and so,
they got the money

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.466 align:middle line:84%
and took it and
gave it to Grandma.

00:06:44.466 --> 00:06:46.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Because
I said-- [STUTTERS].

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.904 align:middle line:90%
And they saw me.

00:06:49.904 --> 00:06:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why did Peaches
and Pumpkin do that?

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Because I was afraid.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.236 align:middle line:90%
I was terrified.

00:06:54.236 --> 00:06:56.110 align:middle line:84%
I got caught with the
hand in the cookie jar.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.943 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:06:56.943 --> 00:06:59.150 align:middle line:84%
So they took the money and
gave it back to Grandma.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Then she says, here.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.064 align:middle line:84%
They got the money and
put it in their purse.

00:07:02.064 --> 00:07:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And they gave it to
Grandma that evening.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:10.680 align:middle line:84%
In about, I don't know, the time
escapes me, but Grandma put me

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.600 align:middle line:90%
on a bus.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.446 align:middle line:84%
After that event, I was shipped
to Kansas City, Missouri.

00:07:15.446 --> 00:07:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Because you had done
something wrong in her home.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: I had
done something wrong.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.951 align:middle line:84%
And everybody was talking
about how Kenny was a thief.

00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:23.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how
old were you then?

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: I don't know, 7
or 8, something like that.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:26.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was just moving
toward 9 or 10.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.560 align:middle line:84%
Because I remember when
I got to Kansas City,

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.950 align:middle line:84%
I was still in
elementary school.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And I continued my ways, even
when I got to Kansas City.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And I moved in I learned
the lay of the land.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.910 align:middle line:90%
I discovered A&P Supermarket.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.752 align:middle line:84%
And A&P Supermarket had this
thing called a candy aisle.

00:07:48.752 --> 00:07:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yep, you obviously
had a weakness for sweets.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And so I said,
wow, the stores up here

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.240 align:middle line:84%
have a whole aisle of candy
and nobody's watching.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.830 align:middle line:90%
Oh, hoo, hoo, boy!

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But no, I mean, were
you OK with being sent back,

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.450 align:middle line:84%
I assume to join your mom
again and your siblings?

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:09.434 align:middle line:90%
You were OK with that?

00:08:09.434 --> 00:08:12.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Not really, because I
knew I had done something wrong

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.266 align:middle line:90%
and no one had consulted me.

00:08:13.266 --> 00:08:14.650 align:middle line:90%
And I'm being put on a bus.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.360 align:middle line:84%
So I knew, I mean, intuitively,
I knew something wasn't right.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.568 align:middle line:90%
But I'm going to be with Mom.

00:08:18.568 --> 00:08:20.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:20.890 align:middle line:90%
And I got there.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.440 align:middle line:84%
About the time I
get there, there's

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:90%
another brother, Reggie.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.390 align:middle line:90%
He's on the scene now.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Then, later on, there
was Maurice, Robin,

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.770 align:middle line:90%
and there's Shiloh.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:35.159 align:middle line:84%
So now there's four
of us in this family.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:38.444 align:middle line:84%
And we live in this one place,
and we all sleep on the couch.

00:08:38.444 --> 00:08:41.799 align:middle line:84%
And again, I realize I have
to make a decision here

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:44.130 align:middle line:84%
on how to take care
of myself, because we

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:45.955 align:middle line:90%
don't have-- we're poor.

00:08:45.955 --> 00:08:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Buying clothing for me and
having money in my pocket,

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.460 align:middle line:84%
those things just
weren't happening.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.200 align:middle line:84%
So I saw, again, I have to go
out and make things happen.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.850 align:middle line:84%
So in order to supplement
my little belly--

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your lifestyle.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: --my lifestyle--
I would go and steal a candy.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And what that did, Regina, over
the weeks and months and days,

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.180 align:middle line:84%
that led me to other guys that
were doing the same thing.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:16.970 align:middle line:84%
I started seeking out guys
who were like-minded like me.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's when this
criminal nature slowly

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.412 align:middle line:90%
started escalating.

00:09:25.412 --> 00:09:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And because my mother saw
who I was hanging out with.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.212 align:middle line:84%
She says, quit hanging
out with those hoodlums.

00:09:31.212 --> 00:09:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And I kept hanging
out with the hoodlums.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And I kept learning, getting
more and more sophisticated.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:41.910 align:middle line:84%
As I got older, I started
stealing cars, joy riding,

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.770 align:middle line:90%
really, stuff like that.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, let
me ask you, was

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:50.407 align:middle line:84%
part of what you were
doing a sense of belonging?

00:09:50.407 --> 00:09:51.240 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Oh, yeah.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
now you actually

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.920 align:middle line:84%
had a family that
you could relate to,

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.520 align:middle line:84%
which was the guys
you were hanging with.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, it's very true.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Once I discovered the
"hoodlums," as my mother

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.000 align:middle line:84%
called-- they became my family,
my brothers, my everything.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Because they totally saw me
in a-- like you said earlier,

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.300 align:middle line:84%
the Gangaji was the first
person that really saw me.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.546 align:middle line:90%
Well, the criminals saw me too.

00:10:17.546 --> 00:10:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they were
a reflection of them.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.540 align:middle line:84%
They were just
holding up mirrors,

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:21.680 align:middle line:90%
and you were seeing each other.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.221 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: We were
seeing each other.

00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And I say that because they
appreciated what I could do.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.950 align:middle line:90%
I had no fear.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:33.110 align:middle line:90%
I would do anything.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.460 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time as I'm
hanging out with these guys,

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:43.590 align:middle line:84%
there was this violent nature
that was slowly gaining ground.

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Anger, all this other
stuff was gaining ground.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was this partly due
to the fact that you were all

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.200 align:middle line:90%
also maturing?

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.350 align:middle line:84%
You were going through
puberty together?

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And did most of the
guys in your gang or group

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:03.552 align:middle line:84%
have similar backgrounds
where there was some violence?

00:11:03.552 --> 00:11:06.052 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: When you go to the
house, there was no dad there.

00:11:06.052 --> 00:11:08.330 align:middle line:84%
If you walk in the
house, hey, where's Dad?

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.180 align:middle line:90%
He's not here.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:15.521 align:middle line:84%
Victor, Joseph,
Jimbo-- pick them.

00:11:15.521 --> 00:11:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And I would go in
the house, there's

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Mom there and Sis, no Dad.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And Mom's working.

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Mom's working.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She's exhausted.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.457 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Exhausted.

00:11:25.457 --> 00:11:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In how
many cases were there

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.540 align:middle line:84%
stepdads or boyfriends
that were maybe not

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.410 align:middle line:90%
very helpful to the situation?

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: It was just-- I'm
always amazed, even now, when

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:43.260 align:middle line:84%
I see a mother and father
raising a child all the way up

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.060 align:middle line:90%
until they're 30.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.070 align:middle line:90%
And they're off in collage.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:47.461 align:middle line:90%
Wow, man, how would that--

00:11:47.461 --> 00:11:48.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How would that feel?

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:49.050 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: How would that feel?

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
in your community

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.690 align:middle line:84%
that you were hanging out
with, nobody knew that feeling.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: No one
knew that feeling.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And also, we were a bunch
of angry, young black guys,

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.730 align:middle line:84%
and we were beating
each other up.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:04.494 align:middle line:84%
I remember the way of greeting
each other was, man, come here,

00:12:04.494 --> 00:12:06.410 align:middle line:84%
let's see how hard I can
hit you in the chest.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:07.380 align:middle line:90%
Can you take it?

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And so we would see how
hard we could take a punch.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And so, pretty soon, we
started fighting and beating.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.330 align:middle line:90%
There's just the violence.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:22.180 align:middle line:84%
I remember about my coming up,
the violence and anger and rage

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:26.700 align:middle line:84%
were a part of the fabric,
just something you accepted.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.660 align:middle line:90%
Then you to jail.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.076 align:middle line:84%
Then they taught
you how to fight.

00:12:29.076 --> 00:12:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So violence was always--
you can get to prison,

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:32.942 align:middle line:90%
you've got to carry a knife.

00:12:32.942 --> 00:12:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Then when you're on the streets,
you've got to carry a gun.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.970 align:middle line:84%
It was always
anger, always rage,

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:39.680 align:middle line:84%
always how to
protect yourself, how

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:45.670 align:middle line:84%
to stay in control of
whatever you're doing,

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:49.660 align:middle line:84%
whatever business you're
into, whether it's drugs,

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.650 align:middle line:90%
robbery, burglary, thieving.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, the
violence was there.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And the violence for
me, Regina, never really

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.665 align:middle line:90%
stopped over all the years.

00:13:04.665 --> 00:13:06.040 align:middle line:84%
It just kept-- it
was just there.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.990 align:middle line:84%
The anger, the rage,
was always there.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting ahead of myself now.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.865 align:middle line:84%
And I saw it when I
went back to prison

00:13:14.865 --> 00:13:17.350 align:middle line:84%
and I started working with
men and women in prison.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:18.620 align:middle line:90%
I just thought, wow.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're looking at
it from the other side now.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, now
I'm out of prison.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.310 align:middle line:90%
I've had my Wiccan experience.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:25.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we're going
to go back through all that,

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:26.050 align:middle line:90%
still.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, and I went
back in, and saw this anger,

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.620 align:middle line:90%
this rage is still here.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.920 align:middle line:90%
It never really left.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And then I get out,
and I get married,

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.690 align:middle line:84%
and a whole bunch of other
stuff, and still, it was there.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And so, I guess my take on
prison rehabilitation, reform,

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:51.200 align:middle line:84%
or anything, it has got to deal
with the rage and the anger

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:57.330 align:middle line:84%
that's in all inmates-- male,
female, white, black, Latino,

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Afghanistan, Jewish,
whatever the case may be.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:84%
If you have been placed
inside of a prison setting

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.790 align:middle line:84%
for an amount of weeks
and days and months,

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:10.110 align:middle line:84%
you have some unresolved
anger and rage there.

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.910 align:middle line:90%
Just with a prison, it does it.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, prison
will do that alone,

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.480 align:middle line:84%
aside from what
you bring into it.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Going in, you've
got to start dealing.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.622 align:middle line:90%
You've got to start--

00:14:19.622 --> 00:14:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Defending yourself.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:22.163 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: --defending yourself.

00:14:22.163 --> 00:14:23.740 align:middle line:84%
A lot of guys get
beat up, get raped.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.490 align:middle line:90%
This is regular.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:30.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a regular thing
to where you come out

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.690 align:middle line:84%
with that same
rage into society.

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:35.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.947 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm going to
write a note to you,

00:14:37.947 --> 00:14:39.780 align:middle line:84%
because I want to ask
you about what happens

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.350 align:middle line:90%
as soon as one gets out.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:45.287 align:middle line:84%
But OK, so what landed
you in prison initially?

00:14:45.287 --> 00:14:47.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Initially,
what landed me in jail

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.760 align:middle line:84%
was joy riding, stealing
cars from the guys.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And then as I got
more-- I got out

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.640 align:middle line:84%
of the juvie,
juvenile hall, then

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.650 align:middle line:90%
I hooked up with some more guys.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm still
poor, still broke.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:03.500 align:middle line:90%
I still need money.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Now there are seven
of us in the family.

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:07.030 align:middle line:90%
Everybody is grown now.

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Mom is doing the best she
can as a single mother.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:15.110 align:middle line:90%
My stepfather, he's struggling.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And so, I said, well,
I see the situation.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.485 align:middle line:84%
I've got to keep
taking care of myself.

00:15:18.485 --> 00:15:20.340 align:middle line:90%
So I became a career criminal.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.456 align:middle line:90%
I just made my decision.

00:15:21.456 --> 00:15:22.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be a criminal.

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make more
money than he's making,

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.680 align:middle line:90%
so I'm going to be a criminal.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started,
as you talked about earlier,

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:37.410 align:middle line:84%
I started stuffing my
feelings, stuffing my emotions.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to do the
crimes that I was doing,

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.645 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't have compassion.

00:15:45.645 --> 00:15:47.790 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't feel vulnerable.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:53.340 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't have any
concern for the other.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:58.520 align:middle line:84%
So there was no
feeling for the other.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And over the weeks
and months and years,

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.000 align:middle line:90%
that became my persona.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:03.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel.

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:04.750 align:middle line:90%
I know nothing.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.320 align:middle line:90%
Nothing can touch me.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't bode well
when you've had an awakening.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.500 align:middle line:90%
You're out of prison.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.042 align:middle line:90%
Now you want to live your life.

00:16:15.042 --> 00:16:16.375 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you're so guarded.

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:17.235 align:middle line:90%
You're so shut down.

00:16:17.235 --> 00:16:19.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: But you haven't
dealt with that shutdown, man.

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:21.780 align:middle line:90%
It's still there.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
you were in and out.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Finally you go in for 40 years.

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.817 align:middle line:84%
Was that partly the result of
having been a repeat offender?

00:16:29.817 --> 00:16:31.150 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:32.775 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And again,
when you come out,

00:16:32.775 --> 00:16:36.430 align:middle line:84%
it's not necessarily easy
to find work with a record.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:41.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's really hard to go
through the normal streams.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.720 align:middle line:90%
And again, you're broke.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:90%
You have a record.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And say you're determined
to break this cycle, what

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.410 align:middle line:84%
are some of the options that
are available for a person

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:52.380 align:middle line:90%
fresh out of prison?

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.840 align:middle line:84%
Like some of the guys you
were friends with there

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.170 align:middle line:90%
that tried to make a fresh go.

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.970 align:middle line:90%
But is it nearly impossible?

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:01.490 align:middle line:90%
Or, what are you limited to?

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:03.360 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: We have
a lot of programs.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.735 align:middle line:90%
Most cities have programs.

00:17:05.735 --> 00:17:06.535 align:middle line:90%
There's programs--

00:17:06.535 --> 00:17:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You go into
your halfway house.

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: You go
to a halfway house.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:09.790 align:middle line:90%
You can go to welfare.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:11.260 align:middle line:90%
You can go to unemployment.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.361 align:middle line:84%
You can go to a lot of
places that say, well, we

00:17:13.361 --> 00:17:15.819 align:middle line:84%
don't have anything for you
here, but you can go over here.

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:17.194 align:middle line:84%
And you can always
go to welfare,

00:17:17.194 --> 00:17:19.720 align:middle line:90%
and they'll give you something.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.640 align:middle line:90%
But then what about the jobs?

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.485 align:middle line:84%
Then what about the
living situation?

00:17:23.485 --> 00:17:26.922 align:middle line:90%


00:17:26.922 --> 00:17:28.130 align:middle line:90%
There's layers of this stuff.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And so when a guy gets
out-- a man or woman

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:35.030 align:middle line:84%
gets out of prison, if
they don't have any money,

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.210 align:middle line:84%
and they're standing
downtown there

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:38.881 align:middle line:90%
at San Rafael in California.

00:17:38.881 --> 00:17:39.880 align:middle line:90%
And they're off the bus.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.255 align:middle line:84%
They just got out
of San Quentin.

00:17:41.255 --> 00:17:42.997 align:middle line:90%
And there they are--

00:17:42.997 --> 00:17:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right in the middle
of Marin County, "Yuppieville"--

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: And I have no money.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And there's a
liquor store over there,

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.943 align:middle line:84%
and there are some guys
hanging around over there.

00:17:50.943 --> 00:17:52.570 align:middle line:90%
And what do I do?

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's that little seedy
area on up the street there.

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:56.490 align:middle line:90%
I say, well.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:57.360 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.990 align:middle line:84%
So the guy says,
well, I have no money.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:02.230 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:04.600 align:middle line:90%
His old nature kicks in.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.534 align:middle line:90%
I've got to hustle.

00:18:05.534 --> 00:18:06.470 align:middle line:90%
I've got to panhandle.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:07.625 align:middle line:90%
I've got to do something.

00:18:07.625 --> 00:18:11.120 align:middle line:84%
So he starts gravitating
to areas or somewhere

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.480 align:middle line:84%
where he can--
man, what can I do?

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And some way,
somehow, they always

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:19.100 align:middle line:90%
find a place to stay or lay.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.600 align:middle line:84%
Then they get back
into their world.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.845 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult--
I mean, even when

00:18:23.845 --> 00:18:26.230 align:middle line:84%
I was working inside
the prison, and the guys

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.850 align:middle line:84%
would be in my program,
and I would get them out.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And the hardest people
to work with-- it's

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:35.270 align:middle line:84%
still emotional for me-- is
for the ones who have been

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.820 align:middle line:90%
child abusers, child molesters.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.595 align:middle line:90%
No one likes them.

00:18:39.595 --> 00:18:41.850 align:middle line:84%
No one wants to get
them up to start.

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.880 align:middle line:84%
So when they get out
there, it's like, they

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.670 align:middle line:90%
have to sleep on the ground.

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Because no one really
likes-- and the system

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.470 align:middle line:84%
has set it up to where
you can't go here.

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:53.800 align:middle line:90%
You can't live here.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:58.930 align:middle line:84%
You don't have no program for
the child abuser or molester.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:00.972 align:middle line:84%
They have it really,
really, really, really hard.

00:19:00.972 --> 00:19:02.388 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
it's kind of over,

00:19:02.388 --> 00:19:03.740 align:middle line:90%
because your profile is there.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.292 align:middle line:90%
It's in your Neighborhood Watch.

00:19:05.292 --> 00:19:06.500 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: It's kind of over.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.875 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your
face is out there.

00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:08.750 align:middle line:90%
Your life's over.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And it's like,
these guys, these men and women

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.742 align:middle line:90%
are sick.

00:19:12.742 --> 00:19:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is the part I
want to talk to you about.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:22.940 align:middle line:84%
So in prison, there is so much
controversy over prison reform

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:23.740 align:middle line:90%
these days.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And one of the real
bones of contention

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:29.190 align:middle line:90%
is what you just said.

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:33.970 align:middle line:84%
You have people who are
psychologically really unwell,

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:35.870 align:middle line:84%
who end up doing
things that you would

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:39.700 align:middle line:84%
expect for an unstable human
being that's emotionally

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:44.780 align:middle line:90%
or psychologically hurting.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.580 align:middle line:84%
What, in your observation,
of the people around you

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.540 align:middle line:84%
in prison-- and I'm not saying
it as a mathematical number,

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.340 align:middle line:90%
per se.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.470 align:middle line:84%
But roughly, what
percentage of the people

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:55.330 align:middle line:84%
you saw when you
looked around were

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:59.040 align:middle line:84%
people who should have been
in psychological facilities,

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.860 align:middle line:90%
or maybe drug rehab facilities?

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.634 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for a minute.

00:20:05.634 --> 00:20:07.300 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: I started
doing prison work--

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.475 align:middle line:84%
I think it was 2005,
2006-- in San Quentin.

00:20:10.475 --> 00:20:11.275 align:middle line:90%
I was excited.

00:20:11.275 --> 00:20:13.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm going back into-- I'm out.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.530 align:middle line:90%
I had my spiritual awakening.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:90%
I got funding to do a program.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.470 align:middle line:90%
It's This Sacred Space.

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And the focus of
This Sacred Space

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:24.015 align:middle line:84%
is to bring conscious awareness
to those incarcerated.

00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:25.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm going back to my own.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:26.990 align:middle line:90%
And I was like--

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, motivated.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:29.414 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, motivated.

00:20:29.414 --> 00:20:31.290 align:middle line:90%
And I get inside.

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And I start working with
the men and talking.

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And they're excited about me,
after having some victories.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:42.210 align:middle line:84%
But there were more
defeats than anything.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Because there was all
this anger and this rage.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And I saw they could let go
of their story for a moment--

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.934 align:middle line:84%
I'm a bad person-- and
have a [INHALES / EXHALES].

00:20:59.934 --> 00:21:01.950 align:middle line:90%
I can breathe.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:03.690 align:middle line:90%
But then they'll go right back.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that there
needs to be more done here.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:13.151 align:middle line:84%
And my program can do this, but
what about this, this, this,

00:21:13.151 --> 00:21:13.950 align:middle line:90%
and this?

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the
psychological help

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:15.560 align:middle line:90%
that's needed.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.143 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Then I start seeing
the hopelessness of everything,

00:21:18.143 --> 00:21:19.380 align:middle line:90%
like oh, this is kind of--

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's hard, because
you went back in all enthused.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Enthused, right.

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, at
one point now, you

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.320 align:middle line:84%
didn't have the typical type of
problems we're talking about.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.627 align:middle line:84%
You had chosen this
as a career path.

00:21:30.627 --> 00:21:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yes, yes.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And you had blocked off
the empathy in your life

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.080 align:middle line:84%
for whatever else
was going on around.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.038 align:middle line:84%
This is how you were
going to make your living,

00:21:38.038 --> 00:21:39.620 align:middle line:90%
through these various endeavors.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.790 align:middle line:84%
So you end up there
for 40 years now.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And as I recall,
you started slipping

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.577 align:middle line:90%
into a depression yourself.

00:21:47.577 --> 00:21:48.410 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Oh, yeah.

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
an affable guy.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.300 align:middle line:90%
You stayed out of trouble.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.250 align:middle line:84%
We all see shows like
"Orange is the New Black,"

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:57.620 align:middle line:84%
in the case of women, and
"Prison Break," and these

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.945 align:middle line:84%
shows where Hollywood
gives their depiction.

00:21:59.945 --> 00:22:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And some of it is
pretty darn rough.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:08.170 align:middle line:84%
But the reality was you couldn't
really handle it much anymore.

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And tell us what was
happening in your life.

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:13.354 align:middle line:84%
Because I remember about
you saving your pills.

00:22:13.354 --> 00:22:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
why you had finally started

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:20.950 align:middle line:90%
losing your spirits there.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.625 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: What happens is
that over the years, the months

00:22:23.625 --> 00:22:28.430 align:middle line:84%
of being a criminal, I kept
going back and kept going back

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:29.450 align:middle line:90%
and kept getting worse.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:32.120 align:middle line:90%
I said, hm, I heard about this.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.450 align:middle line:84%
There comes a point
in a criminal's career

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:40.040 align:middle line:84%
where they can end up getting
life and never get out.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And that happened to
me, because I kept

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.100 align:middle line:90%
be a criminal I kept hustling.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I
was making a lot of money.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What were your
primary areas you're

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:47.580 align:middle line:90%
making money in at that time?

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.371 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Oh, cashing
checks at this time.

00:22:49.371 --> 00:22:52.140 align:middle line:84%
I was totally into
fraud, forgery.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was making thousands
of dollars a week.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And I finally got a call
after two or three years

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:59.670 align:middle line:90%
of this checks kiting scheme.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And the federal
government arrested me,

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:08.020 align:middle line:90%
took me to Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.000 align:middle line:90%
And the judge gave me 40 years.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:11.917 align:middle line:90%
I was 32 years of age.

00:23:11.917 --> 00:23:14.541 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you're not going to
get out of prison until you're

00:23:14.541 --> 00:23:15.725 align:middle line:90%
at least in your '40s.

00:23:15.725 --> 00:23:16.745 align:middle line:90%
I said, wait a minute.

00:23:16.745 --> 00:23:17.545 align:middle line:90%
I'm 32.

00:23:17.545 --> 00:23:20.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get out of
this over 10 years from now?

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.880 align:middle line:90%
And I just said--

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.088 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was a minimum.

00:23:23.088 --> 00:23:24.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Guaranteed 10.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:90%
You're going to do 10.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't care what you do.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.856 align:middle line:84%
I don't care how you do it,
but you're going to do 10.

00:23:30.856 --> 00:23:33.980 align:middle line:84%
I said, wait a
minute, I'm 32, 42.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.910 align:middle line:90%
That's a decade--

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you're a young
man, that's like forever.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Then I realized that
this judge was a conscious man,

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.600 align:middle line:84%
was an awake man, was
clear about this guy

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.400 align:middle line:90%
here is a criminal.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.920 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't know what he's doing.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:51.400 align:middle line:84%
I've got to put him
away until he wakes up.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.089 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he did.

00:23:53.089 --> 00:23:54.130 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:56.129 align:middle line:84%
And I did the first 10
years, and the whole time

00:23:56.129 --> 00:23:58.210 align:middle line:84%
I was in prison
the first 10 years,

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:00.907 align:middle line:84%
I was reading, reading,
reading, and reading.

00:24:00.907 --> 00:24:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What were you reading?

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.698 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Everything
known to man.

00:24:03.698 --> 00:24:07.080 align:middle line:84%
I was reading Frantz
Fanon, Anne Wren.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:13.340 align:middle line:84%
I was reading "Playboy,"
"Penthouse," "Hustler,"

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.759 align:middle line:90%
the "Bhagavad Gita"--

00:24:15.759 --> 00:24:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Love it, "Playboy"
and "Bhagavad Gita,"

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.824 align:middle line:90%
yeah, sure, why not?

00:24:18.824 --> 00:24:19.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Everything.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All parts of
the being and needs.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: I was
reading everything.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was only here
lately that I've

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:31.360 align:middle line:84%
been reading something
called cognitive therapy.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And I read where it's a
kind of therapy that's

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.330 align:middle line:90%
dealing with the thoughts.

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know I
was actually-- oh,

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.780 align:middle line:84%
there was something
called bibliotherapy.

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually reading
myself into waking up.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.410 align:middle line:84%
In the "Bhagavad Gita," it says,
if you repeat the name of God

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:53.290 align:middle line:84%
over and over and
over and over, you

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.285 align:middle line:84%
would have what we
call an epiphany,

00:24:55.285 --> 00:24:56.285 align:middle line:90%
an awakening experience.

00:24:56.285 --> 00:25:02.085 align:middle line:84%
You'll be free of
prisons, of the sin.

00:25:02.085 --> 00:25:03.622 align:middle line:90%
I said, I'm a sinner.

00:25:03.622 --> 00:25:06.080 align:middle line:84%
I want to be free of the sin,
because it was getting worse,

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.860 align:middle line:84%
and I was ready
to commit suicide.

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, I got 40 years
for writing bad checks.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:16.300 align:middle line:84%
They sent me to federal
prison in Chicago.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:19.770 align:middle line:84%
I got there in Chicago,
and I looked around, and I

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:21.686 align:middle line:90%
was so depressed, Regina.

00:25:21.686 --> 00:25:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm going
to commit suicide.

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:26.930 align:middle line:84%
That's why I have a lot of
empathy for people who say,

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:27.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm depressed.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.666 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to commit suicide.

00:25:28.666 --> 00:25:29.720 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Life will put you in a corner
where you say, I want out.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There are
no good options.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.980 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: No options.

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:36.060 align:middle line:90%
I want out.

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:37.590 align:middle line:90%
And so I said, OK, I want out.

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:39.760 align:middle line:90%
Where's my option?

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Exit door, how can I
take that door to death?

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:43.330 align:middle line:90%
How can I get there?

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:44.370 align:middle line:90%
Oh, take some pills.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:46.000 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going to escape
from the 14th floor.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but you're
in prison, so how did

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:47.750 align:middle line:90%
you get the pills?

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:48.520 align:middle line:90%
How does all that work?

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.436 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: The doctor.

00:25:49.436 --> 00:25:51.710 align:middle line:84%
You go to the doctor and
say, hey, I'm depressed,

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:54.050 align:middle line:90%
and I want some sleep.

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:56.391 align:middle line:84%
All right, so you
got sleeping pills.

00:25:56.391 --> 00:25:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And I
start sticking them--

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You put them
away, put them away.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And this
prison guard saw me.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was watching
you saving the pills.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: He came to my cell,
and he said, little hustler,

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:12.826 align:middle line:84%
that light that you're trying
to put out will not die.

00:26:12.826 --> 00:26:14.952 align:middle line:84%
I said, what are you
talking about, man?

00:26:14.952 --> 00:26:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A prison guard
said, the light you're

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:18.931 align:middle line:90%
trying to put out will not die?

00:26:18.931 --> 00:26:20.180 align:middle line:90%
That was an enlightened guard.

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: That was a
very enlightened guard.

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:22.990 align:middle line:84%
He was a Christian
guard, and he was

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:26.614 align:middle line:84%
speaking from the
perspective of Christians,

00:26:26.614 --> 00:26:28.780 align:middle line:84%
"This little light of mine,
I'm gonna let it shine."

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.259 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And so,
I said, I don't

00:26:31.259 --> 00:26:32.550 align:middle line:90%
know what you're talking about.

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:34.175 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want you
to do me one favor.

00:26:34.175 --> 00:26:35.258 align:middle line:90%
See those guys over there?

00:26:35.258 --> 00:26:36.200 align:middle line:90%
Go talk to those guys.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Those guys are
very positive guys.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:38.530 align:middle line:90%
These are guys in the day room.

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:39.416 align:middle line:90%
He was in my room.

00:26:39.416 --> 00:26:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Look, those guys out
there are very positive.

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:42.259 align:middle line:90%
Go talk to those guys.

00:26:42.259 --> 00:26:44.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are they kind
of like Rastafarian guys?

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.662 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:45.662 --> 00:26:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I remember that, yeah.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And I went
to the guy who had

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.291 align:middle line:90%
the dreadlocks, and everything.

00:26:49.291 --> 00:26:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And I went to these guys, and
they were very positive, very

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.990 align:middle line:90%
encouraging, very supportive.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we're
going to help you.

00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And they prepared me to
fight my case legally.

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And so once I realized I
had an option, I had hope.

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:11.940 align:middle line:90%
Then I gave the pills away.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.500 align:middle line:90%
I was no longer depressed.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.730 align:middle line:90%
I was excited because why?

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:15.240 align:middle line:90%
I had hope.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.115 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hope, yeah.

00:27:16.115 --> 00:27:20.820 align:middle line:90%


00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:24.400 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: I find if you
have hope, there's a chance.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And even people with
life, or whatever,

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.020 align:middle line:84%
they still have
some kind of hope.

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:29.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a little bit.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:33.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but we don't
need a lot to continue with.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.810 align:middle line:90%
Hope's an amazing thing.

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: You don't need much.

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:38.950 align:middle line:90%
Even the suicide was hope.

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:40.200 align:middle line:90%
I had an option.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.820 align:middle line:90%
I was back in control.

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:44.765 align:middle line:90%
That's my control.

00:27:44.765 --> 00:27:46.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm in control now.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, the judge
didn't have my life.

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:50.870 align:middle line:90%
I have control of my life.

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to take it.

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:55.945 align:middle line:84%
But the brothers gave
me another option.

00:27:55.945 --> 00:28:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And so, my teaching
on my message today,

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:05.650 align:middle line:84%
at the age of 67, after spending
so many years in prison,

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:09.500 align:middle line:84%
after working in prison, and
being married, and having

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:15.450 align:middle line:84%
written a book, my
message is this.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:20.610 align:middle line:84%
The more we can get
healthy, self-help material

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:24.410 align:middle line:84%
into the male or female
so they can read that,

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:25.650 align:middle line:90%
that's one thing.

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:30.400 align:middle line:84%
But then once they are
ready to come out here,

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.720 align:middle line:90%
then they need something else.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:32.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.590 align:middle line:90%
OK, so these guys--

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:37.170 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: They can read this
stuff-- the preparedness,

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:38.430 align:middle line:90%
the reading and studying.

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:40.250 align:middle line:90%
That starts the process.

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But these are almost
cellular memories by this time.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.365 align:middle line:90%
These are programs.

00:28:44.365 --> 00:28:46.730 align:middle line:90%
These are just programs.

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:50.495 align:middle line:84%
So with these guys,
what kind of things

00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:51.620 align:middle line:90%
were they sharing with you?

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.670 align:middle line:90%
What were they having you read?

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And then when you did
Gangaji come into it?

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Gangaji
came into my life

00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:00.620 align:middle line:84%
after the suicidal
episode passed.

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was,
from then on, I had hope.

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:07.500 align:middle line:84%
So for five years, I was
fighting my case all the way

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:08.860 align:middle line:90%
to the Supreme Court.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.230 align:middle line:84%
By the time they denied
me, I'm halfway done.

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:13.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm cool now.

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:13.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm playing tennis.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:14.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm lifting weights.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm running.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.092 align:middle line:90%
I cool now.

00:29:16.092 --> 00:29:16.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm gellin'.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.890 align:middle line:90%
I got me a little hustle going.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:18.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm making money.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:19.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm cool now.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:20.967 align:middle line:90%
I'm back to--

00:29:20.967 --> 00:29:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Control of your life--

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Control of my life.

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --within prison.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.001 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Within prison.

00:29:25.001 --> 00:29:26.350 align:middle line:90%
And then I got out of prison.

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:27.700 align:middle line:90%
I went in in 1982.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:29.330 align:middle line:90%
I got out in 1992.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:31.590 align:middle line:10%
When I got out in
1992, my brother Robin,

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:33.640 align:middle line:10%
the youngest of the
family, had just

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.700 align:middle line:10%
died a month earlier from AIDS.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:36.670 align:middle line:10%
And that just like--

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:37.550 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: So now
there's six of us,

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:42.850 align:middle line:84%
and my mother has not recovered
from the youngest passing

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:45.770 align:middle line:90%
away, so her baby.

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:48.500 align:middle line:90%
And so I come out.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.420 align:middle line:84%
The youngest brother
has passed away.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:51.800 align:middle line:90%
My mother is distraught.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:56.292 align:middle line:84%
And I had to go to
Iowa to do my program.

00:29:56.292 --> 00:29:57.750 align:middle line:84%
I go back there
with my girlfriend.

00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:58.710 align:middle line:90%
I get to Iowa.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm there for about
16 months, and I violate.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:03.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm back in the prison.

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:04.930 align:middle line:90%
I go back to federal prison.

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in federal
prison in Colorado.

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:08.972 align:middle line:90%
I lived in Colorado.

00:30:08.972 --> 00:30:10.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's when Gangaji came.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Because Gangaji had a
nonprofit organization

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:15.495 align:middle line:84%
right here in Boulder, called
the Gangaji Foundation.

00:30:15.495 --> 00:30:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And they were coming in to
prisons sharing their message.

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And also, at the same time, the
Trungpa Rinpoche-- Shambhala

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:24.520 align:middle line:90%
was coming in.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Their organization
with the Buddhists

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:28.430 align:middle line:84%
was coming in,
sharing their message.

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:31.910 align:middle line:84%
So we had Gangaji, who
was at [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And the Buddhist guys, they
were sharing their teachings

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.130 align:middle line:90%
with us.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:41.740 align:middle line:84%
So we were having a lot of
spiritual material fed to us.

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was in 1995 when Gangaji
came to the prison-- 1994,

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry-- when she
came to the prison

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:50.680 align:middle line:84%
where I had my awakening
in September 1994.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by awakening
is that guy, that mindset,

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:03.530 align:middle line:84%
those thoughts that
were keeping me robbing,

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:12.480 align:middle line:84%
stealing, pimping, doing these
very violent things, when

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.960 align:middle line:84%
I had my connection
with Gangaji,

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.770 align:middle line:84%
I looked into her
eyes, and I saw myself.

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:17.850 align:middle line:90%
And I felt this love.

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:20.180 align:middle line:90%
And I felt this acceptance.

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:23.410 align:middle line:90%


00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:27.640 align:middle line:84%
That criminal nature
was turned upside down.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:32.090 align:middle line:84%
It was gone, but in its
place was this emptiness.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:36.457 align:middle line:84%
This guy is like,
what do I do now?

00:31:36.457 --> 00:31:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, let's talk about
that moment with her for a bit.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Because, obviously,
throughout all of this,

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.460 align:middle line:84%
you had done a good job of
hiding from yourself, OK.

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
no less hiding what

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.060 align:middle line:84%
you were doing as much
as you could or needed to

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.920 align:middle line:90%
from other people.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.050 align:middle line:84%
But was there a sense
with her that you

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:56.140 align:middle line:90%
couldn't hide anything?

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Mm, even today, if
she was to walk into the room,

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.560 align:middle line:90%
I would say--

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:08.710 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Because she sees me.

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:12.270 align:middle line:84%
She actually sees me,
sees me through the core.

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:16.390 align:middle line:90%


00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:20.830 align:middle line:84%
She can look in my eyes
and see that I'm afraid.

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:22.880 align:middle line:90%
She could see me.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And I had never seen
anyone to see me.

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh my god, this
is-- my whole body,

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:32.691 align:middle line:90%
you just want to bow.

00:32:32.691 --> 00:32:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because she's still
loving you and accepting

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:36.064 align:middle line:90%
you, no matter what.

00:32:36.064 --> 00:32:37.980 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: She's not
seeing me as [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like, wow,
Kenny, I see you.

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:41.930 align:middle line:90%
You're suffering.

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:43.682 align:middle line:90%
Wow, you're beautiful.

00:32:43.682 --> 00:32:44.890 align:middle line:90%
Wow, how have you been doing?

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:48.050 align:middle line:90%
It's always positive.

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:51.730 align:middle line:90%
It's always encouraging.

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:53.280 align:middle line:90%
It's always embracing.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.635 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what were
the feelings the first time

00:32:55.635 --> 00:32:57.600 align:middle line:84%
you had that connection
with her in the eyes?

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.475 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: When I first
looked into her eyes,

00:32:59.475 --> 00:33:10.430 align:middle line:90%
I said, what's going on here?

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:12.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting here, and
she's talking to people.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:18.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, damn, what's-- and
I walked out of the prison.

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:21.790 align:middle line:84%
When I walked out of the chapel,
after this meeting with her,

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:27.353 align:middle line:84%
and I met one of the volunteers,
I looked into her eyes, I said,

00:33:27.353 --> 00:33:31.750 align:middle line:84%
[GASPS], I recognized something
in another human being.

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:33.160 align:middle line:90%
I saw something in Gangaji.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.156 align:middle line:84%
Then I saw the same thing in
this other-- in the volunteer.

00:33:36.156 --> 00:33:38.019 align:middle line:84%
I said, are you
like this always?

00:33:38.019 --> 00:33:40.060 align:middle line:84%
There we started having
a different conversation.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.195 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yes.

00:33:41.195 --> 00:33:42.140 align:middle line:90%
I said, wow.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And what I meant was, are
you in this love always?

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.010 align:middle line:90%
Are you happy always?

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:49.910 align:middle line:90%
Are you in this peace always?

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:50.710 align:middle line:90%
She says, yes.

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:53.806 align:middle line:90%
I said, wow, this is cool.

00:33:53.806 --> 00:33:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I bet it was
from where you're sitting.

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:57.090 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And that was the beginning of
the base gross criminal nature

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.560 align:middle line:90%
being taken from me.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:11.570 align:middle line:84%
But the refined aspects
hadn't been dealt with.

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I understand
that, but the point

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.980 align:middle line:90%
was you recognized each other.

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:18.300 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a one-way deal.

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.346 align:middle line:84%
When she saw you, you
could see that in her.

00:34:20.346 --> 00:34:21.429 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:34:21.429 --> 00:34:23.199 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
speaks to the point

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:25.710 align:middle line:84%
that in most human
beings, regardless

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:28.020 align:middle line:84%
what we've chosen
to do with our time,

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:32.940 align:middle line:84%
that essence inside is
always still available to be

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:35.050 align:middle line:90%
either recognized or lit up.

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And in your case,
you were lucky enough

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:42.620 align:middle line:84%
to have a mirror reflect
that back in yourself to you,

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.969 align:middle line:84%
the goodness in you,
and the parts that

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:48.699 align:middle line:84%
are kind and gregarious and
loving, which you hadn't seen

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:50.480 align:middle line:90%
in a long time in yourself.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, I can see it
now in you, the same, the same.

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:56.635 align:middle line:84%
No difference in
Gangaji, no difference

00:34:56.635 --> 00:34:59.410 align:middle line:84%
in the cameraman there, no
difference in my wife, no one.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:00.210 align:middle line:90%
It's the same.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:02.727 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the
essence of the human being.

00:35:02.727 --> 00:35:05.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, now I'm going to ask you
a little off-topic question

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:06.870 align:middle line:90%
on that.

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:09.730 align:middle line:84%
When you were in prison,
were there people

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:13.250 align:middle line:84%
that you felt had cut
off so severely from that

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:19.310 align:middle line:84%
that they would never recover it
and would always really remain

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:21.200 align:middle line:84%
a danger to society,
because they just

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.705 align:middle line:90%
couldn't recover themselves?

00:35:22.705 --> 00:35:23.505 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah.

00:35:23.505 --> 00:35:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Some guys just-- that was the
hardest part, seeing some guys

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:27.340 align:middle line:90%
just are gone.

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.570 align:middle line:90%
They aren't coming back.

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:31.840 align:middle line:90%
They just aren't coming back.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even know
if there's anything

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:36.980 align:middle line:90%
that can be done for them.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:41.540 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
everyone can be healed.

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:43.650 align:middle line:84%
But would it happen
in this lifetime?

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:44.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:49.600 align:middle line:84%
But most people that you were
around could come back, right?

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: They could come back
if they wanted to come back.

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:55.140 align:middle line:90%
See, I wanted to come back.

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.940 align:middle line:84%
Even now, my friends say,
Kenny, what I love about you,

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.190 align:middle line:90%
you want to do the work.

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:02.862 align:middle line:84%
You're excited about
doing the work.

00:36:02.862 --> 00:36:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean is
that the healing

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.740 align:middle line:84%
will keep working on myself,
working on the fears,

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.210 align:middle line:84%
working on the insecurities,
working on the doubts,

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:13.340 align:middle line:84%
working on not having enough
money to pay the bills.

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Keep working on those things,
because we're eternal beings.

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:18.670 align:middle line:90%
We don't stop.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:22.930 align:middle line:84%
When we lay the body down,
our awareness keeps going.

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:24.510 align:middle line:90%
Now I don't know where it goes.

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:27.430 align:middle line:90%
That's my next journey.

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:31.090 align:middle line:84%
But I have enough spiritual
insights and wisdom

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:36.320 align:middle line:84%
that once I lay this body down,
this awareness, this knowledge,

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.640 align:middle line:90%
goes with me.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:40.800 align:middle line:84%
The body, boom,
back to the grave.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.732 align:middle line:84%
But this awareness
is still here.

00:36:43.732 --> 00:36:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So because you
know that, you're motivated.

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.970 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
after Gangaji,

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:51.510 align:middle line:84%
after this being seen, and
being able to see others,

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:54.910 align:middle line:84%
then how did you end up
getting back out of prison?

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:56.840 align:middle line:84%
How did you carry
this work forward?

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
This Sacred Space

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.740 align:middle line:84%
and what you've done
through the years.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: After I got out of
prison, I moved to Kansas City

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:03.740 align:middle line:90%
for a year.

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:04.610 align:middle line:90%
I stayed with my mother.

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:07.109 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How long did you have
to stay in prison that time?

00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: This last time I
stayed-- I went in in 1994,

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.600 align:middle line:84%
and I got out in 1997,
so about three years.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Relatively
short sentence.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:15.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:17.053 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, two
and a half years.

00:37:17.053 --> 00:37:20.040 align:middle line:84%
I got out in 1997, and then
I stayed with my mother

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:20.975 align:middle line:90%
for a year.

00:37:20.975 --> 00:37:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And I bonded with my grandkids,
my daughter, and everybody.

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:25.560 align:middle line:90%
Then my parole officer loved me.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And I said, man, I went
to Colorado for a month.

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:31.095 align:middle line:84%
For Thanksgiving of
1997, I went to Colorado,

00:37:31.095 --> 00:37:34.240 align:middle line:84%
and I met so many
Gangaji people.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:36.444 align:middle line:90%
I said, I'm coming back here.

00:37:36.444 --> 00:37:38.110 align:middle line:84%
So I went to my parole
officer and said,

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:39.624 align:middle line:84%
I want to move to
Boulder, Colorado.

00:37:39.624 --> 00:37:41.040 align:middle line:84%
He said, if you
give me an address

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.589 align:middle line:90%
and pay the state, no problem.

00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:45.130 align:middle line:84%
So I had plenty of people say,
you can stay here in my house.

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:46.855 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, I'm
going to pay the state.

00:37:46.855 --> 00:37:47.970 align:middle line:90%
I gave him the address.

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:49.120 align:middle line:90%
I packed my car up.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.940 align:middle line:84%
I drove out here, to the
chagrin of my daughter.

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:53.300 align:middle line:90%
She wanted me to stay there.

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.370 align:middle line:90%
My mother was happy.

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:55.170 align:middle line:90%
Because why?

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:56.720 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't a criminal anymore.

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.610 align:middle line:84%
I was following this
spiritual teacher.

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Whoever she is, I
don't care, as long

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.469 align:middle line:90%
as he's not robbing anymore.

00:38:02.469 --> 00:38:03.760 align:middle line:90%
Because my mother was grateful.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.940 align:middle line:90%
She was thrilled.

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.220 align:middle line:90%
And I got to Colorado.

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:09.400 align:middle line:90%
I stayed here for a year.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And then I was invited to go
to San Francisco-- no, LA.

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:16.510 align:middle line:84%
I went to LA, and I
met the people there.

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:17.950 align:middle line:90%
Then I went to San Francisco.

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:19.600 align:middle line:90%
And it says, come back.

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And I went back to California
almost six or seven months

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:22.880 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:25.930 align:middle line:84%
I got to California,
and I got here,

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:31.130 align:middle line:84%
and I was doing limousine
work, driving limousines.

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:32.722 align:middle line:90%
I was happy driving a limousine.

00:38:32.722 --> 00:38:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Then one day, I
say, you know what?

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm not driving a
limousine anymore.

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Those five years, from 1999
to-- five years-- 2003,

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:42.850 align:middle line:84%
something like that,
I drove a limousine.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:48.736 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2005, I
met this gentleman

00:38:48.736 --> 00:38:50.320 align:middle line:90%
who's a Gangaji supporter.

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:53.215 align:middle line:84%
And he says, hey, let's
start a prison program.

00:38:53.215 --> 00:38:54.505 align:middle line:90%
I'll fund it.

00:38:54.505 --> 00:38:56.576 align:middle line:90%
You can do the work.

00:38:56.576 --> 00:38:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've never heard
nothing like that.

00:38:58.450 --> 00:38:59.380 align:middle line:90%
So I said, OK, sure.

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:00.190 align:middle line:90%
How do we look?

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And so he says, well, get
this, get this, get this.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't know a thing
about bookkeeping.

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:04.963 align:middle line:84%
I don't know a thing
about accounting.

00:39:04.963 --> 00:39:06.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't know anything.

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:08.240 align:middle line:84%
But someway, somehow,
all of these people

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:11.810 align:middle line:84%
came together to help me get
my nonprofit, the website,

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:14.715 align:middle line:84%
and the mission, and the
vision, and the funding.

00:39:14.715 --> 00:39:16.020 align:middle line:90%
It all came together.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And I started going
into certain prisons.

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I was extremely
excited, because now, I said,

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.750 align:middle line:90%
I can give back.

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:24.760 align:middle line:90%
It feels good giving back.

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.850 align:middle line:84%
But over the weeks and months
and years of giving back,

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Regina, working with
the men, the women,

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:38.620 align:middle line:84%
I started seeing something
that was disheartening.

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:42.610 align:middle line:84%
I realized I couldn't fix
them all, that what I had

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:44.020 align:middle line:90%
was not enough.

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were basically
teaching them meditation skills

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:47.850 align:middle line:90%
and practices.

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Meditation, read,
read, read, pray, pray, pray,

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:56.301 align:middle line:90%
yoga, yoga, yoga.

00:39:56.301 --> 00:39:57.300 align:middle line:90%
Let go of your thoughts.

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:57.900 align:middle line:90%
Let go of your thoughts.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:58.900 align:middle line:90%
Let go of your thoughts.

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.452 align:middle line:90%
Let go of your thoughts.

00:40:01.452 --> 00:40:03.160 align:middle line:84%
As Gangaji said, get
ready for your heart

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.790 align:middle line:84%
to be broken over and
over and over again.

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Because so many of the men and
women just weren't ready to

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:11.470 align:middle line:90%
wake up.

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:15.020 align:middle line:84%
They said they were,
but the reality

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:18.199 align:middle line:84%
of letting go of their
past life, or letting go--

00:40:18.199 --> 00:40:19.240 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.040 align:middle line:90%
It's a young man.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.090 align:middle line:90%
He was mentally ill.

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:22.340 align:middle line:90%
He was in my program.

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:23.944 align:middle line:84%
He was homeless,
about 20 years old.

00:40:23.944 --> 00:40:25.610 align:middle line:84%
He said, Kenny, I
need to work with you.

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:26.660 align:middle line:90%
I want to work with you.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.090 align:middle line:90%
He was in my program, a group.

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:30.720 align:middle line:84%
So we start working
individually, like this here.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And so he got to the
point, I said, how would it

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:38.817 align:middle line:84%
feel if you had to
have a job, make money,

00:40:38.817 --> 00:40:40.067 align:middle line:90%
and that you'll pay the state?

00:40:40.067 --> 00:40:49.010 align:middle line:90%


00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:49.810 align:middle line:90%
He hit anger.

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:52.890 align:middle line:90%


00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:56.000 align:middle line:90%
He got so angry.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.480 align:middle line:90%
He says, I'm done.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.450 align:middle line:84%
I said, whoa, whoa,
no, let's keep working.

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:01.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm done.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:02.084 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:41:02.084 --> 00:41:03.000 align:middle line:90%
I said, what happened?

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.250 align:middle line:90%


00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:11.650 align:middle line:84%
I can't see myself
not being homeless.

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:13.445 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These
are the programs,

00:41:13.445 --> 00:41:17.216 align:middle line:84%
the programs inside the
head, the entire being.

00:41:17.216 --> 00:41:18.224 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Oh, my god.

00:41:18.224 --> 00:41:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And then he fell into
one of those categories,

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:22.330 align:middle line:90%
psychological, or whatever.

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Therapists would say
he's this, he's that.

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:24.970 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh my god.

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:27.100 align:middle line:90%
And I said, please stop.

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:31.227 align:middle line:84%
And that is when I realized
that, uh-oh, I don't think--

00:41:31.227 --> 00:41:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Meditation
only goes so far.

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: So far, if
they're going to go so far,

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:38.112 align:middle line:90%
the person has got to want this.

00:41:38.112 --> 00:41:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
know what, Kenny?

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:42.920 align:middle line:90%
It's not just in prison.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.990 align:middle line:84%
It's throughout
all of humankind,

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:51.510 align:middle line:84%
where we think we can learn
a technique or two, right?

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And we can be dedicated
to it, like you

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.260 align:middle line:90%
have been dedicated to it.

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And you were able, but you
had to go through a lot

00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:59.610 align:middle line:90%
to find your way out.

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, you have these
psychological subconscious--

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.190 align:middle line:90%
subconscious is where it's at.

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:07.440 align:middle line:84%
All these programs live
in the subconscious,

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.820 align:middle line:90%
below our level of awareness.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: That's right.

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:09.890 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:12.645 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
how did you learn--

00:42:12.645 --> 00:42:14.520 align:middle line:84%
how did that
knowledge define you

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:17.220 align:middle line:84%
when you started seeing
this is a program that's

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:18.380 align:middle line:90%
not going to be broken.

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:21.416 align:middle line:84%
Here's someone, I think, that
we can begin working with.

00:42:21.416 --> 00:42:23.870 align:middle line:84%
What is the X
factor in the person

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:26.770 align:middle line:84%
that has the same
kind of programs

00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:28.000 align:middle line:90%
that finds their way out?

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Well, I'll
give you an example.

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:33.815 align:middle line:84%
One of my students right
now, today, his name

00:42:33.815 --> 00:42:35.980 align:middle line:90%
is "Chatterbox"-- Anthony.

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And when he got the
message, he says,

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:40.690 align:middle line:84%
man, I see what you're
talking about, Kenny.

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:42.075 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:42:42.075 --> 00:42:43.300 align:middle line:90%
His eyes lit up.

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:44.450 align:middle line:90%
He got out of prison.

00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:46.140 align:middle line:90%
He got married.

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And today, now, we
talk all the time.

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And he was just-- one
victory is all I need.

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And he just gave me all
the-- he kept me going.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.620 align:middle line:84%
I have encouragement, because
I saw how he took the message,

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:01.130 align:middle line:90%
had the awakening experience.

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:06.042 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
it's not in the numbers.

00:43:06.042 --> 00:43:07.500 align:middle line:84%
If I've got 50 guys
in the program,

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.150 align:middle line:84%
I want 50 guys to
have the awakening.

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:12.930 align:middle line:84%
I realized that if this one
guy can change his life,

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:16.300 align:middle line:84%
that he's going to change so
many other people's lives.

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:18.050 align:middle line:90%
He's married.

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:19.340 align:middle line:90%
He's working with people.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:20.440 align:middle line:90%
His son is with him.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:21.960 align:middle line:90%
His son-in-law is with him.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:24.620 align:middle line:84%
In another words, he is just
normally living his life.

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.130 align:middle line:90%
He's still got his issues.

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:29.450 align:middle line:84%
I would suggest therapy,
but he doesn't need to.

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:30.250 align:middle line:90%
He's fine.

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:35.744 align:middle line:84%
But he's out and he's
not returning to prison.

00:43:35.744 --> 00:43:36.660 align:middle line:90%
He's not a recidivist.

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:41.280 align:middle line:84%
He's not encouraging other
people to recidivate.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:46.840 align:middle line:90%
And so, I was excited.

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy, grateful.

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:53.250 align:middle line:84%
But still, Regina, I
didn't know till just here

00:43:53.250 --> 00:44:00.170 align:middle line:84%
lately that oh, man,
there's still another piece

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:02.230 align:middle line:84%
that most people
need and they're not

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:05.870 align:middle line:90%
getting from the system.

00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:07.330 align:middle line:84%
The system was
giving it to them,

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:09.480 align:middle line:84%
but it's giving it-- I
was reading the other day.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.880 align:middle line:90%
This says they did some studies.

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Cognitive therapy, well,
with I guess, drug therapy.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.510 align:middle line:90%
They had so many.

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And the ones who were
doing the cognitive therapy

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:26.790 align:middle line:84%
were just reading about their
depression, their negativity,

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and how they can change
it, and doing little tests.

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:34.970 align:middle line:84%
And the ones who were doing
drugs, they was given drugs.

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And they were
saying that the ones

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.507 align:middle line:84%
that's reading on their
own improved immensely.

00:44:41.507 --> 00:44:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
they were motivated.

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:44.385 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: They were motivated.

00:44:44.385 --> 00:44:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And they were taking
the material in.

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:47.899 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, it's going
into the subconscious,

00:44:47.899 --> 00:44:50.450 align:middle line:84%
and it's healing
those places, right?

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:53.180 align:middle line:84%
But the ones who were
doing drugs, well, drugs,

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:54.430 align:middle line:90%
so on and so forth.

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And so, because there was no
therapy to go along with it.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So they're saying,
those who are depressed

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:04.365 align:middle line:84%
and doing the bibliotherapy,
if we can get you

00:45:04.365 --> 00:45:06.555 align:middle line:84%
some therapy to
go along with it,

00:45:06.555 --> 00:45:08.500 align:middle line:84%
these people have
got a great chance.

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
happens, say-- OK,

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:12.385 align:middle line:84%
so a man or woman
gets out of prison.

00:45:12.385 --> 00:45:14.010 align:middle line:84%
One of the first
things they want to do

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:15.930 align:middle line:84%
is hook up with someone
and have a relationship.

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:17.471 align:middle line:84%
Because they've been
isolated, alone,

00:45:17.471 --> 00:45:22.600 align:middle line:84%
lonely, without touch for a
long time, in a lot of cases.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Yet, these parts
haven't been healed.

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: That's right.

00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:27.896 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now you go
out, and what kind of person

00:45:27.896 --> 00:45:30.120 align:middle line:84%
are you going to
usually hook up with?

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.627 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Well, most likely,
the guys that are getting out,

00:45:32.627 --> 00:45:34.210 align:middle line:84%
or the woman getting
out, either she's

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:35.620 align:middle line:90%
a victim or a perpetrator.

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:37.490 align:middle line:84%
So victim/perpetrator
relationships develop.

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Will continue.

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Continue.

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:42.415 align:middle line:84%
And then you wonder why,
we've been together a year

00:45:42.415 --> 00:45:43.895 align:middle line:84%
or six months,
and then we argue.

00:45:43.895 --> 00:45:44.150 align:middle line:90%
We fight.

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:46.090 align:middle line:84%
My wife, we went
through the same thing.

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:49.434 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally, we realized
that if we keep doing this,

00:45:49.434 --> 00:45:51.100 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to
be in a relationship.

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:51.530 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:53.260 align:middle line:84%
You love me, but something
is going on here.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Same old
programs playing.

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:54.820 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Same old programs.

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And what I found out is that--
I went to my therapist friend.

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.120 align:middle line:84%
She says, Kenny, maybe you
should see a therapist.

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.620 align:middle line:84%
I said, no problem, because I
want the relationship to last.

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:04.745 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm working with
the therapist, he's saying,

00:46:04.745 --> 00:46:07.908 align:middle line:84%
well, she has this,
and you have this.

00:46:07.908 --> 00:46:11.790 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh my god, what about
all the men and the women that

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:15.925 align:middle line:84%
are coming out of prison that
will not get this knowledge,

00:46:15.925 --> 00:46:17.880 align:middle line:90%
won't get help.

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because there's
nothing in the system set up

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:20.420 align:middle line:90%
to really help.

00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:21.315 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: No.

00:46:21.315 --> 00:46:22.605 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's there.

00:46:22.605 --> 00:46:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's the halfway
house experience like?

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: OK, halfway
houses-- I'll give an example.

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:31.470 align:middle line:90%
I know a guy.

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:34.690 align:middle line:90%
He has good credit.

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:38.490 align:middle line:84%
He's been in the
rehabilitation field out here.

00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, he says,
I'm going to open up me,

00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:42.040 align:middle line:90%
buy five houses.

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.300 align:middle line:90%
So he goes to the bank.

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.570 align:middle line:84%
I want to buy this house,
this house, this house.

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And I want to run it for--
so the bank says, yes.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.420 align:middle line:84%
This is a good
moneymaking opportunity.

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:53.564 align:middle line:84%
You've got 10 guys in
one house, and they're

00:46:53.564 --> 00:46:54.480 align:middle line:90%
paying $1,000 a month.

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.120 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:59.380 align:middle line:84%
So the bank is happy
to support him.

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:00.945 align:middle line:84%
But all these guys
are coming out

00:47:00.945 --> 00:47:04.010 align:middle line:84%
to this guy's house, which
is just a place to stay,

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:04.810 align:middle line:90%
go get a job.

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not like you're
getting psychological therapy

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.080 align:middle line:90%
and help, per se.

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.496 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Those
things are there,

00:47:09.496 --> 00:47:12.460 align:middle line:90%
but that's not the focus.

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:15.750 align:middle line:84%
The focus is getting a job
and paying the mortgage,

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:17.360 align:middle line:90%
so you can pay the bank.

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.190 align:middle line:90%
That's the focus.

00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:21.104 align:middle line:90%
That's the real focus now.

00:47:21.104 --> 00:47:22.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like,
OK, you're here, man.

00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:24.936 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to make that
check, man, because I've

00:47:24.936 --> 00:47:25.960 align:middle line:90%
got to pay the mortgage.

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.379 align:middle line:90%
So they have things in place.

00:47:27.379 --> 00:47:29.670 align:middle line:84%
When guys get out, they have
a house that's a pit stay.

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But then you're
back to the same old problem.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.109 align:middle line:84%
You can't get a job because
you've got a record.

00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: You've got a record.

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:38.694 align:middle line:84%
Then you get angry, and you
start doing drugs, get alcohol.

00:47:38.694 --> 00:47:39.860 align:middle line:90%
Pretty soon, you're back in.

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Back in, yeah.

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: For those who get the
job, get the car, get two girl,

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:51.980 align:middle line:84%
get the house, and get
the baby, then there

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:57.660 align:middle line:84%
is something sinister
that's still going on.

00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:00.690 align:middle line:84%
The wife is wondering why
every six months, we have

00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:02.800 align:middle line:90%
these blowups and these fights.

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:03.661 align:middle line:90%
We're still having--

00:48:03.661 --> 00:48:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Violence, and stuff.

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:07.202 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Right, the rage
in him has not yet-- I mean,

00:48:07.202 --> 00:48:08.534 align:middle line:90%
he's still drinking on the side.

00:48:08.534 --> 00:48:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Or he's still
smoking cigarettes,

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.480 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the case may be.

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And what I have been
saying over the years,

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:17.770 align:middle line:84%
and what I really,
really, really say now

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:21.680 align:middle line:84%
is that when a man or a
woman get out of prison,

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:23.360 align:middle line:90%
they should go through a filter.

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And the filter should be
like a hospital setting,

00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:29.490 align:middle line:90%
where therapy is there.

00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:33.135 align:middle line:84%
Everything is there to
heal so they get educated.

00:48:33.135 --> 00:48:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And you come into a-- You're
going to go home in six months.

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:38.740 align:middle line:84%
But before you go home, we're
going to give you some tools.

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:42.280 align:middle line:84%
First this, this, this, these
things you have going here.

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to
read so many books.

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.030 align:middle line:90%
It's self-help.

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:48.860 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
can't hit the bricks

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:51.784 align:middle line:84%
until they start working
on that stuff that's there.

00:48:51.784 --> 00:48:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And they need to be
taught and educated.

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:54.330 align:middle line:90%
You've got anger running.

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:55.130 align:middle line:90%
You've got fear.

00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:57.250 align:middle line:84%
We've got things
running here that has

00:48:57.250 --> 00:49:01.160 align:middle line:84%
to be dealt with if we're
going to heal the human being

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.010 align:middle line:90%
and heal society.

00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:04.290 align:middle line:90%
You can get them a job.

00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:05.960 align:middle line:90%
I was telling Doug that.

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:11.395 align:middle line:84%
I says, you can
take and put a pig

00:49:11.395 --> 00:49:14.424 align:middle line:84%
in a beautiful pair of
shoes, and everything--

00:49:14.424 --> 00:49:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Lipstick
on a pig, yeah.

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:16.615 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: It's still a pig.

00:49:16.615 --> 00:49:17.415 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:17.415 --> 00:49:20.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And so I had
my awakening experience,

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:22.420 align:middle line:84%
and nice clothes, and
everything, and I got married.

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:24.720 align:middle line:90%
But still, I was wounded.

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.130 align:middle line:90%
Still, I was traumatized.

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Still, I needed someone to sit
down across from me and say,

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Kenny, the reason you're
still angry at your wife

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:35.790 align:middle line:84%
is because these are certain
things you haven't looked at.

00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe that
most men and women, when

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.410 align:middle line:84%
they get out, they should
go see a professional,

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:47.280 align:middle line:84%
or have a professional at their
disposal just so there are no--

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are there
funds for that?

00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:49.650 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: This is what it--
This is what you're like, well,

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:54.200 align:middle line:90%
look at-- I would talk to Doug.

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.400 align:middle line:84%
I said, look what the
poli-- there's funds.

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.090 align:middle line:90%
Of course, there's funds.

00:49:58.090 --> 00:49:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Does society want
to support that?

00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:01.000 align:middle line:90%
Does the politicians want to?

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:01.800 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nope.

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:04.810 align:middle line:90%
No, prisons are big business.

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:06.937 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Bernie Sanders,
he's getting millions

00:50:06.937 --> 00:50:08.020 align:middle line:90%
and millions and millions.

00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're chasing
Bernie Sanders.

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.280 align:middle line:84%
If Bernie Sanders becomes
president next week,

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.130 align:middle line:84%
next month, whenever,
and Bernie Sanders

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:15.620 align:middle line:84%
is going to be like George
Bush, Obama, and anybody else.

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:17.345 align:middle line:84%
Then till at the
end, then he could

00:50:17.345 --> 00:50:19.136 align:middle line:84%
start pushing his little
programs, whatever

00:50:19.136 --> 00:50:20.600 align:middle line:90%
they is-- if.

00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:23.390 align:middle line:84%
But there's no
millions and millions

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and millions of dollars
to hear Bobo the convict,

00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:31.966 align:middle line:90%
or Mary the prostitute.

00:50:31.966 --> 00:50:33.620 align:middle line:90%
There's no funds for that.

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:38.342 align:middle line:84%
Let me just limited funds,
but there's not a major--

00:50:38.342 --> 00:50:41.790 align:middle line:84%
A guy in San Francisco
says, I would

00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:46.120 align:middle line:84%
like to have a hospital
set up for men and women

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.870 align:middle line:84%
to come out of jail and
go here and get healed.

00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:49.670 align:middle line:90%
He's that smart.

00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It makes total sense.

00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:52.280 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: It makes total sense.

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.999 align:middle line:90%
Ronald Reagan got rid of the--

00:50:53.999 --> 00:50:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, a lot of funding
for mental health facilities.

00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: In mental illness,
those guys, men and women,

00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:00.260 align:middle line:90%
land up in prison.

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:02.817 align:middle line:84%
I would go to prison, and I
would watch my back sometimes.

00:51:02.817 --> 00:51:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm saying,
that guy is a nut,

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.450 align:middle line:90%
and I'd better watch him.

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I
was asking you earlier.

00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:07.570 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of that in prison.

00:51:07.570 --> 00:51:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And I have had nuts
come up to me and swing on me

00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:11.078 align:middle line:84%
and start fighting,
swinging at me.

00:51:11.078 --> 00:51:13.820 align:middle line:84%
I had to beat them off me,
because they'd have flipped.

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:14.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:15.370 align:middle line:90%
They're mentally ill.

00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:16.060 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: They're mentally ill.

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:19.193 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: And you're releasing
those people in society.

00:51:19.193 --> 00:51:21.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here's convicts
afraid of other convicts.

00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And you let that guy out
as a-- and so I'm afraid,

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:24.897 align:middle line:90%
and he's angry.

00:51:24.897 --> 00:51:26.355 align:middle line:84%
And you let us out
back in society.

00:51:26.355 --> 00:51:27.866 align:middle line:90%
So what are we going to do?

00:51:27.866 --> 00:51:29.240 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
beat our women up.

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:30.310 align:middle line:90%
We're going to slap our kids.

00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:31.685 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
whatever we can

00:51:31.685 --> 00:51:35.510 align:middle line:84%
out of rage, because that
has not been dealt with,

00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:37.192 align:middle line:90%
that trauma.

00:51:37.192 --> 00:51:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You saw the
work that Doug Noll

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:41.560 align:middle line:84%
is doing-- we only have a
couple minutes left-- as well.

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with
this thing that, in a sense,

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:47.780 align:middle line:90%
Gangaji did for you.

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:48.821 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yes, yes, yes.

00:51:48.821 --> 00:51:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was doing deep
seeing, but also listening.

00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:56.594 align:middle line:84%
And as Doug Noll's
project, a Prison of Peace,

00:51:56.594 --> 00:51:58.010 align:middle line:84%
they're doing this
deep listening.

00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Do you see some real
hope that something

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:06.270 align:middle line:84%
that really as simple as
having someone feel heard

00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:10.645 align:middle line:84%
is going to make a
difference in that world?

00:52:10.645 --> 00:52:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: When people
come into prison,

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:15.790 align:middle line:84%
inmates are so happy to
see them, to get a visit.

00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:17.510 align:middle line:90%
So whatever you bring is fine.

00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And when you bring,
it they receive it.

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I have hope for those
guys, the men and women who

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:25.620 align:middle line:84%
are anxious to receive the
teachings and the truth

00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:28.430 align:middle line:84%
and the medicine that myself,
Doug, and other people

00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:30.000 align:middle line:90%
bring in.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:37.390 align:middle line:84%
But then they have to come
out and keep doing the work.

00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:38.720 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't stop.

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:39.660 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't stop.

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:42.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it doesn't stop.

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:52.150 align:middle line:84%
This society needs
health care professionals

00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:54.960 align:middle line:84%
dealing with a
part of our society

00:52:54.960 --> 00:53:00.025 align:middle line:84%
that's over a million people
that are actually wounded.

00:53:00.025 --> 00:53:01.300 align:middle line:90%
We know they're wounded.

00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:02.610 align:middle line:90%
Why do we know?

00:53:02.610 --> 00:53:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Look what the crimes
that they're committing.

00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:04.410 align:middle line:90%
Look what they're doing.

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:05.210 align:middle line:90%
They're hurting.

00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:08.830 align:middle line:84%
They're screaming out,
help me, help me, help me.

00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so this
is out of pop culture,

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:15.940 align:middle line:84%
but the movie "Straight Outta
Compton," I went to see that.

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:18.316 align:middle line:84%
I think it probably should be
up for some Academy Awards.

00:53:18.316 --> 00:53:19.398 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, probably.

00:53:19.398 --> 00:53:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well done.

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:25.630 align:middle line:84%
But as a white woman watching
it, middle class, I think,

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:28.350 align:middle line:84%
is it that bad that
these guys are just

00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:30.795 align:middle line:84%
three or four guys that are
together on a Friday night.

00:53:30.795 --> 00:53:33.124 align:middle line:84%
They're just hanging out,
talking on the street,

00:53:33.124 --> 00:53:35.290 align:middle line:84%
and some police come up and
just start slamming them

00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:36.960 align:middle line:90%
into the hoods of cars?

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:38.400 align:middle line:90%
That's their reality?

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.804 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: That's all the time.

00:53:40.804 --> 00:53:41.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I was angry.

00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:44.010 align:middle line:84%
I was just getting more
upset and angry watching

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:47.560 align:middle line:84%
the movie, thinking, how can
you treat people like that?

00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Regina,
this happens every day.

00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:51.030 align:middle line:90%
That's my reality.

00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.830 align:middle line:90%
That's my reality.

00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:54.880 align:middle line:84%
As an African American
man, I drive-- even

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:57.480 align:middle line:90%
in Sonoma, California.

00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, very
liberal, beautiful.

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: There's
nothing happening.

00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:01.623 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, nothing
happening there.

00:54:01.623 --> 00:54:02.938 align:middle line:90%
A lot of good cheese and wine.

00:54:02.938 --> 00:54:04.688 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Yeah, grapes
are growing there.

00:54:04.688 --> 00:54:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Grapes are
popping up all around.

00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:13.860 align:middle line:84%
But there's four or five
policemen at Starbucks.

00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And I go get my
coffee, and I'm like,

00:54:15.810 --> 00:54:19.620 align:middle line:84%
I brace myself just
walking by, There's

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:22.280 align:middle line:84%
no need for me to brace myself,
but I'm an African American,

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:24.290 align:middle line:90%
there's police.

00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's my nervous system
that-- while I'm driving,

00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:31.250 align:middle line:90%
it's just there.

00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:33.375 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, no, it
didn't happen for no reason.

00:54:33.375 --> 00:54:36.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's a long history.

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:37.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:38.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:42.011 align:middle line:84%
But even like it was portrayed
with the young rappers that

00:54:42.011 --> 00:54:43.510 align:middle line:84%
were coming up,
they started rapping

00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:45.700 align:middle line:84%
because they couldn't
take the pain of living

00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:46.560 align:middle line:90%
like that anymore.

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHNSON: That's right.

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:49.895 align:middle line:84%
And that's how they
dealt with their trauma,

00:54:49.895 --> 00:54:51.520 align:middle line:84%
through the singing,
through the music.

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Boy, when it came to
the famous scene in the movie

00:54:55.210 --> 00:55:00.500 align:middle line:84%
at the concert in Detroit,
the famous police scene,

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.300 align:middle line:84%
almost everyone in
the theater was white

00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:05.270 align:middle line:84%
when I went to see the film that
night, and they were all yay.

00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And they were
totally empathizing.

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:12.210 align:middle line:84%
No one wants to see someone
else hurt and humiliated

00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:15.290 align:middle line:90%
in that way.

00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: The human
being by itself

00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:22.820 align:middle line:90%
is a compassionate person.

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:23.672 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:55:23.672 --> 00:55:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: Just a
compassionate, loving person.

00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:27.910 align:middle line:90%
That's by itself.

00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:30.280 align:middle line:84%
It's all the other
things around society

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:33.590 align:middle line:90%
that turns them against.

00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:35.350 align:middle line:84%
You'll see young
men come into prison

00:55:35.350 --> 00:55:38.900 align:middle line:84%
that are innocent and sweet,
and they have to choose a group.

00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:41.025 align:middle line:84%
Well, a young guy, 17,
18, years old, sweet.

00:55:41.025 --> 00:55:43.840 align:middle line:84%
You come from Iran,
you choose a group.

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:46.570 align:middle line:84%
He has to go to
Aryan Brotherhood.

00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And so when he goes
to Aryan Brotherhood,

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:52.050 align:middle line:84%
he's taking on a
racist philosophy.

00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:55.185 align:middle line:84%
And then a young
kid becomes a racist

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:59.345 align:middle line:84%
and starts murdering and killing
just because he has to survive.

00:55:59.345 --> 00:56:00.303 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:56:00.303 --> 00:56:01.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:01.690 --> 00:56:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, well,
we're out of time.

00:56:03.370 --> 00:56:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And on that note, we're going
to have another conversation

00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:08.010 align:middle line:84%
with a couple other people
and look at the subject

00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:09.760 align:middle line:90%
from a number of points of view.

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And just any final
thought on what you think

00:56:12.110 --> 00:56:14.430 align:middle line:90%
the hope of this situation is?

00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:17.700 align:middle line:10%
>>JOHNSON: I believe that
there's hope because of me,

00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:18.500 align:middle line:10%
just because of me.

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:21.225 align:middle line:10%


00:56:21.225 --> 00:56:26.480 align:middle line:10%
I'm my own hope factory.

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Because if I can heal, then
there's hope for everybody.

00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kenny's website
is thissacredspace.org.

wisdom with those behind bars

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.640 align:middle line:10%
for many years now and
is supported by donations

00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:41.980 align:middle line:10%
from those who care
about those who may have

00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:43.910 align:middle line:10%
stopped caring for themselves.
