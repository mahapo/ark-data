[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.422 --> 00:00:10.130 align:middle line:84%
KAEDRICH OLSEN: Here's
an important thing

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.255 align:middle line:84%
to address when we're
talking about the paranormal,

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:13.790 align:middle line:90%
paranormal awareness.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's because we were brought
up, all of us, in this society,

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.940 align:middle line:84%
in this culture to be
afraid of the paranormal.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.430 align:middle line:84%
As children, we're born with our
physical senses and our clair

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.230 align:middle line:90%
senses.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.260 align:middle line:84%
It can come in different ways,
full-blown visual in the mind

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.308 align:middle line:84%
or just a visual impression
of information that's there.

00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:31.850 align:middle line:84%
But when we come to
the clair senses,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.920 align:middle line:84%
we have them turned
on too, but we're not

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.540 align:middle line:90%
given the training to use them.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.942 align:middle line:84%
If anything, the opposite,
because the more you

00:00:37.942 --> 00:00:39.900 align:middle line:84%
resist it, the more it's
going to stick around.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.830 align:middle line:84%
But if you embrace and go,
this really sucks, I hate it,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.718 align:middle line:84%
but it's great, then
you get through it

00:00:44.718 --> 00:00:46.760 align:middle line:84%
and you're like, whoa,
what did I gain from that?

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.810 align:middle line:84%
REGINA MEREDITH: What
did I gain from that?

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:48.110 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.600 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: One of the best
things I love telling people

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.550 align:middle line:84%
for validation of
your clair senses

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.300 align:middle line:90%
is trust the goosebump rush.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.100 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.267 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: That's when you know
you should be saying it,

00:00:57.267 --> 00:00:58.565 align:middle line:90%
because that's validation.

00:00:58.565 --> 00:01:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And I've noticed that the higher
the level of being, the less--

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.750 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: The less
they have to say.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.140 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.044 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: But it's so profound.

00:01:04.044 --> 00:01:04.844 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Absolutely.

00:01:04.844 --> 00:01:06.590 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: One word can
change everything.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.730 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.710 align:middle line:10%
REGINA: Do you feel your
intuitive capabilities

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.590 align:middle line:10%
have taken a bit of a bashing
over the past couple of years?

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.810 align:middle line:10%
Has the density of
Earth's emotional field

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.750 align:middle line:10%
created by us feel like
it's keeping the finer

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.140 align:middle line:10%
parts of our spirit down?

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.940 align:middle line:90%
OK, then.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, Kaedrich Olsen
is with us today

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.440 align:middle line:84%
to help us reconnect with
our higher capacities

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:90%
even in the midst of madness.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.750 align:middle line:90%
And this is madness.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.550 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Oh, indeed.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of fun
stuff going on right now.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.740 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: [LAUGHS] It's so hard
for people to navigate through,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:84%
especially once our
frequencies start

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.180 align:middle line:84%
becoming engaged in stories and
we start on a downward spiral,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.290 align:middle line:84%
literally of our own
personal devolution of sorts

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.140 align:middle line:84%
because we've attached
into these stories

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.750 align:middle line:84%
and this confusion,
mass confusion.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.710 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to help us
square that away and get back--

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.300 align:middle line:84%
get back on the
right path again.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.340 align:middle line:84%
So Kaedrich, last
time we had you on,

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.580 align:middle line:84%
we talked about your
work with runes and Norse

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.890 align:middle line:90%
mythology, and so forth.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.949 align:middle line:84%
This time, we're going to get
into the Kaedrich Olsen prequel

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:12.910 align:middle line:84%
to your life, because
it's really interesting.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Most kids didn't have
your kind of life.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.530 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Indeed.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.420 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So let's
start with your mom

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.170 align:middle line:84%
and her taking you to kind of
paranormal sensitivity training

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.970 align:middle line:90%
lessons.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:90%
And from there, we'll go on.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.860 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:10%
Both of my parents
were really super

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.730 align:middle line:10%
into the paranormal,
supernatural, psychic stuff,

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.780 align:middle line:10%
especially my mom.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.170 align:middle line:10%
She was a professional
astrologer for a while.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And one of my favorite
memories of her

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.530 align:middle line:84%
is back in the old
days of computers

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.060 align:middle line:84%
when you were
programming a BASIC,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.130 align:middle line:84%
she was writing astrology
programs in BASIC.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.930 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Oh.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.617 align:middle line:90%
So she was very skilled.

00:02:44.617 --> 00:02:45.450 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Very skilled.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.800 align:middle line:10%
She'd been around
this for a long time.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.030 align:middle line:10%
And when they knew that I was
picking up psychic abilities

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle line:10%
and was communicating
with spirits

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.117 align:middle line:10%
and I had this
insight coming in,

00:02:55.117 --> 00:02:56.950 align:middle line:10%
they weren't quite sure
what to do about it.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.450 align:middle line:90%
They just knew it was there.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.450 align:middle line:84%
So at a young age,
they started taking me

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.890 align:middle line:90%
to psychic development classes.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:84%
There was a local psychic
here by the name of Joe Rock.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.620 align:middle line:84%
He used to own a bookstore
called Bell, Book, and Candle.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And he would do
regular psychic classes

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.850 align:middle line:90%
at the local community college.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And it would-- a
class everywhere

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.085 align:middle line:84%
from three to 20 people,
but we were always there.

00:03:17.085 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And so how old
were you when this began?

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.572 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Oh, when it began.

00:03:20.572 --> 00:03:21.372 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:03:21.372 --> 00:03:23.100 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: When she first
started taking you

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.190 align:middle line:84%
to people who might assist
your development, whatever

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.060 align:middle line:90%
they were called.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.860 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Let's even go way back
to elementary school.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.110 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.510 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: I remember when I
was even maybe a toddler,

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.360 align:middle line:84%
having memories of this one
church my parents went to.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And you know, kids, we
don't know what we're

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.690 align:middle line:90%
thinking when we're toddlers.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.095 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:42.095 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: But then when I
was in elementary school,

00:03:42.095 --> 00:03:44.040 align:middle line:84%
my parents explored
different churches

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and settled on a Lutheran
Church for a while.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.473 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: That's how I was raised.

00:03:47.473 --> 00:03:48.480 align:middle line:90%
That's dur.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.590 align:middle line:90%
Very dour.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.220 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: Yeah, they
wanted to be normal.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.262 align:middle line:90%
They wanted me to fit in.

00:03:52.262 --> 00:03:54.120 align:middle line:84%
They wanted the
family to fit in,

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.890 align:middle line:90%
so they wanted to be normal.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And I remember distinctly
being on the playground

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.710 align:middle line:90%
with my imaginary friends.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.510 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.730 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: And everyone
else's imaginary friends,

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.920 align:middle line:84%
they play house, they
play on the swings,

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.690 align:middle line:90%
they play other games.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.250 align:middle line:90%
Mine were like, no.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.540 align:middle line:90%
This is the nature of reality.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Here are five
levels of existence

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.080 align:middle line:84%
and here are the things
that are going on.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, OK, great.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.892 align:middle line:84%
So they're teaching me
all of these things.

00:04:17.892 --> 00:04:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, it
got to the point

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:84%
where my clairvoyance
is kicking in.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing things and able
to describe lights coming in

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.220 align:middle line:84%
and spirits coming in
and what they're saying.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And my parents kind
of went, all right.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to our old church.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.890 align:middle line:84%
So my mom had us go
back to a church that

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.060 align:middle line:90%
was a spiritualist church.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.930 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: I was going
to say, it sure

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:90%
wasn't the Lutheran Church.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.520 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Nope.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.470 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: You'd have had
to pay for those sins.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.710 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Nope.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.168 align:middle line:84%
They went back to
their old church.

00:04:39.168 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:84%
It was called The
Temple of Harmony.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:41.820 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.700 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Spiritualist church.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.140 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.348 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: It was here in Denver.

00:04:44.348 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was your typical
Protestant stand up,

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.532 align:middle line:84%
sit down, stand up,
sit down kind of thing.

00:04:48.532 --> 00:04:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And for a while, I did
go to the Sunday school,

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.217 align:middle line:90%
so it was pretty normal.

00:04:52.217 --> 00:04:53.550 align:middle line:90%
But eventually, I just said, no.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be there.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.100 align:middle line:84%
I want to go see
what's going on here.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And after church
session would conclude,

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.330 align:middle line:84%
the service would
conclude, there

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.120 align:middle line:84%
would be one to three
mediums go up on stage,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.380 align:middle line:84%
sit down, go into a deep trance,
and do trance channeling.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And that was a normal
part of the services.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
my parents said, fine.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.548 align:middle line:84%
We'll go to the other
thing that they do,

00:05:14.548 --> 00:05:16.830 align:middle line:84%
which was every Saturday
night in the church basement

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.640 align:middle line:90%
they would have a big seance.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So now, how old are you when
you go to your first seance?

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.760 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: Mm, I was probably
eight, nine years old.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.613 align:middle line:90%
So Kaedrich's now at a seance.

00:05:29.613 --> 00:05:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Little eight, nine-year-old.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:31.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.363 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how you
experience that from that age.

00:05:35.363 --> 00:05:36.780 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: That was a
very interesting

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.270 align:middle line:84%
developmental process
for me, because one

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.760 align:middle line:84%
of the critical
awakening moments I

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.420 align:middle line:84%
had was a seven-year-old at my
grandmother's house for the one

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.340 align:middle line:84%
and only night I stayed
over at her house,

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.400 align:middle line:84%
back when she had HBO that
was on a satellite dish.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And my sister who was seven
years older than I am really

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.190 align:middle line:90%
wanted to watch "The Exorcist."

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.650 align:middle line:84%
So here I am, a seven-year-old
with awakened abilities,

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.150 align:middle line:84%
and now I'm watching
"The Exorcist."

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.340 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Well, that's harsh.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.990 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: But what
was good about it--

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.570 align:middle line:84%
long term, 20/20
hindsight, we look back.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.700 align:middle line:84%
That night, I was
in a room by myself,

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.820 align:middle line:84%
pitch black, completely
thinking about that movie,

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.820 align:middle line:84%
but I forced myself to be aware
of every level of consciousness

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.150 align:middle line:84%
I had, stepping myself down
into sleep, coming back up

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.500 align:middle line:90%
if I was going too slow--

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.080 align:middle line:84%
or going too fast, and
just slowly going back in

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.820 align:middle line:84%
and being aware of
what my thoughts were,

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.470 align:middle line:90%
my awareness was.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.800 align:middle line:84%
So with that baseline of
what "The Exorcist" was--

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.930 align:middle line:84%
and "The Exorcist" scared
the hell out of me.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:31.730 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.790 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: But now I'm eight, nine
years old in seance going, OK.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.540 align:middle line:84%
I know what I'm
experiencing all the time,

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.030 align:middle line:84%
but now we're doing this for
real, so I'm quaking in my--

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.760 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So in a way, did that
movie kind of prepare you

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.600 align:middle line:90%
for the experience?

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.225 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: It really did,
because it helped

00:06:44.225 --> 00:06:47.453 align:middle line:84%
me realize what my thoughts were
versus the external thoughts.

00:06:47.453 --> 00:06:48.870 align:middle line:84%
So that what I'm
seeing in seance,

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.870 align:middle line:84%
I now know it's my
fear versus there's

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.850 align:middle line:90%
nothing scary in the room.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And something like eight,
nine, even 10-year-old kid

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.930 align:middle line:84%
is not sitting there going,
this is my fear I'm processing.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.240 align:middle line:84%
But now I'm in the
room going, there's

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.750 align:middle line:90%
nothing scary in the room.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:05.550 align:middle line:90%
But wait a minute.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid because it's dark
and I'm scared and there's--

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.010 align:middle line:90%
but there's nothing in the room.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And I go back and I remember
the TV shows and the movies

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.910 align:middle line:84%
I've even seen at that
age, because I've always

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:15.990 align:middle line:90%
loved horror movies.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.293 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, this
isn't matching what I'm

00:07:19.293 --> 00:07:20.460 align:middle line:90%
seeing in the horror movies.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.540 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.270 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't-- this isn't right.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.020 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So you were
developing discernment

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.400 align:middle line:90%
at a very early age.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.110 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: A very
early age, learning

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.260 align:middle line:84%
to hear what the external
voices were versus mine, what

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.780 align:middle line:84%
was my own imagination
versus what was coming in,

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and what I was making up
of the whole situation,

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.420 align:middle line:84%
and realized that I actually
had a co-creative power

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.862 align:middle line:90%
in the environment around me.

00:07:40.862 --> 00:07:42.570 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: That's powerful
for a little kid.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.287 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: I'm sitting
there going scared.

00:07:44.287 --> 00:07:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Then I could be
bringing in something.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.520 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, no.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.820 align:middle line:90%
But there's nothing scary here.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.270 align:middle line:84%
So let's tune into the
thing that's really here

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.110 align:middle line:84%
and listen to that
and be a part of that.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.910 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:58.230 align:middle line:84%
So was part of the relationship
you had with your guides

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.660 align:middle line:84%
working with
precognitive information?

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Or were you sometimes
given advance--

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.890 align:middle line:84%
a heads-up on something
that was going

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:08.030 align:middle line:84%
to be occurring in your life,
or someone you loved or knew?

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.340 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: Rarely did I get
precognitive information.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Rarely was I any sort
of prophecy-type thing,

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.690 align:middle line:90%
which was kind of frustrating--

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.023 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Because you wanted that.

00:08:16.023 --> 00:08:16.823 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:16.823 --> 00:08:18.710 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: But it was more
of advanced training.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Like, here's how
consciousness works.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.660 align:middle line:90%
Here's how--

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: The nature of reality.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:22.820 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: The nature of reality.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.278 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And those
are the tools you

00:08:24.278 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:84%
were going to navigate with
for the rest of your life.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.680 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Exactly.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.430 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:31.760 align:middle line:84%
So when you say you were
connected with your guides

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.100 align:middle line:84%
from a very early age,
they were teaching you

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.659 align:middle line:90%
about the nature of reality.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And tell us about those
five levels of reality

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.289 align:middle line:84%
that you were trained in very
early and came to flesh out

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:45.620 align:middle line:84%
and understand much more
as you became an adult.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.660 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: The best way I can
understand that now is

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.700 align:middle line:90%
what we use the term densities.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, like first
density, stone.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Second density are more
of the plant-based.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.340 align:middle line:90%
Third, animals.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Then fourth is where we
have this concept of me

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.650 align:middle line:84%
and who I am and time,
and how that works.

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Then five is where
we are finally

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.340 align:middle line:84%
getting into the collective
and aware of that collective.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.365 align:middle line:84%
So it's more about the
densities and energy levels.

00:09:08.365 --> 00:09:09.740 align:middle line:84%
But they called
them five worlds,

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.170 align:middle line:84%
because that was the only
way I can understand it then.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And when I look back
on it, that's right.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.230 align:middle line:90%
It's like it's a realm.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.760 align:middle line:90%
It's its own reality.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And then you get to these
other realms and realities.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.950 align:middle line:84%
And if something is on
the first or second,

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.800 align:middle line:84%
they have no way of
conceiving the fifth.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just like
this advancement process

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.180 align:middle line:84%
and realizing it
really is the sixth,

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.710 align:middle line:84%
which is all-encompassing, that
everything is the all and it

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.360 align:middle line:84%
comes from the all, and
it's all the same thing,

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.550 align:middle line:84%
just different densities of
that which we would perceive

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.990 align:middle line:84%
as a world, as a realm,
when it really isn't.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.790 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you're using the
terminology such as realm,

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.670 align:middle line:84%
it can get into hermetic
and other texts that

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:53.630 align:middle line:84%
have to do with the
realms of being,

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:57.110 align:middle line:84%
the various realms of entities,
higher and lower Earth

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.350 align:middle line:84%
beings, somewhere in the middle
in their understanding of it.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And that gets into a whole
other connotation of realms,

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:08.150 align:middle line:84%
because it's starting to bring
in the nature of the learning

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.060 align:middle line:84%
or development of various
species in various realms.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And we're very
hierarchical by nature.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.310 align:middle line:84%
I think human beings like to
put everything in a category

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.300 align:middle line:90%
above and below.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's been explained
to me many times,

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.612 align:middle line:84%
it's not the right
way to look at it.

00:10:20.612 --> 00:10:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Each one's developing
in its own right.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.170 align:middle line:84%
We've all been
part of much of it.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:27.860 align:middle line:84%
But just to put that out there,
some of what we'll talk about

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.250 align:middle line:84%
does have to do with
our intermingling

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.590 align:middle line:84%
with realms that
might be learning

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.270 align:middle line:84%
a different kind
of lesson that has

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.510 align:middle line:84%
to do with usury of energy, that
has to do with taking instead

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:39.380 align:middle line:90%
of giving.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the
higher realms, which

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.170 align:middle line:90%
are more of giving than taking.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And we get to play in this
middle with both sides

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.100 align:middle line:84%
all the time, and we see
where we land, right?

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:47.900 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Exactly.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.850 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And we're going to be
talking about some of that.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:51.650 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Excellent.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:52.450 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK, good.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't mind just
introducing that part of it.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Is our play with the
consciousness above

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and the consciousness
below beyond the notion

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.900 align:middle line:84%
of the mineral kingdom,
animal kingdom, and so forth?

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:04.700 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.830 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways I
like to think of this

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:10.310 align:middle line:84%
is that we are a complex
being in and of itself,

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.290 align:middle line:84%
that we have a mental body
and an emotional body.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And the mental body is great
at organizing and putting

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.770 align:middle line:84%
information in a nice,
linear fashion, where

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:22.190 align:middle line:84%
the emotional body is great
with feeling and perceiving

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.770 align:middle line:84%
emotions, and has
to do with memory.

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.800 align:middle line:84%
But then we have
the ethereal body,

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.690 align:middle line:84%
which relates to
the physical body,

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.220 align:middle line:84%
that they correlate
one to another.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.600 align:middle line:90%
One happens to the other.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.670 align:middle line:90%
They both affect.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Then there is the
causal body, which

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.600 align:middle line:84%
is attuned to the people,
places, situations

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.615 align:middle line:90%
that are drawn to you.

00:11:39.615 --> 00:11:41.990 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Talk about that a
little more, because that's one

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.760 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of people
don't understand,

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.190 align:middle line:84%
and it's not talked about
as much, the causal body.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.640 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Yeah.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.515 align:middle line:84%
The causal body's great,
because sometimes we

00:11:48.515 --> 00:11:51.170 align:middle line:84%
see it as somebody's luck,
like if they're really lucky

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:52.820 align:middle line:90%
or if they're unlucky.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And it just comes down to, what
do you believe you deserve,

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.650 align:middle line:84%
and what do you believe
is right for you?

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.050 align:middle line:84%
How do you tune
that one so that you

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:01.765 align:middle line:84%
have the right
opportunities open to you?

00:12:01.765 --> 00:12:03.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you feel
that you're always

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:06.747 align:middle line:84%
in this state of
desperation and in need

00:12:06.747 --> 00:12:08.330 align:middle line:84%
and that nothing
will ever come to you

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:09.710 align:middle line:84%
and you're really
believing that,

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.450 align:middle line:84%
your causal body will
get tuned to that.

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:13.933 align:middle line:84%
And then your reflection
in the world around you

00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:14.850 align:middle line:90%
will come back to you.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see that
and you're like, see?

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't get anything
that I want.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.130 align:middle line:90%
Nothing works out for me.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:20.630 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: It's your
path of causation.

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:21.350 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Exactly.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:22.220 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And that is
interesting, because it

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:29.000 align:middle line:84%
ties into not only your
perception of self, which

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.820 align:middle line:84%
is very heavily driven by the
subconscious, which is driven

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.790 align:middle line:84%
by past experiences,
even past incarnations,

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:40.850 align:middle line:84%
but it's also down to such
mystical things as timing.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.240 align:middle line:90%
Timing is really big.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And we have our own
issues with timing.

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Timing seems to be the
great enemy to humans,

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.950 align:middle line:90%
because it doesn't--

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.320 align:middle line:84%
things don't happen the
way we want it to when

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.700 align:middle line:90%
we want it to happen, right?

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.700 align:middle line:84%
But if you can
just be with timing

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.950 align:middle line:84%
and know when the
window's open and closed.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.280 align:middle line:90%
Talk about timing in this.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.893 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: Yeah, I love to refer
to that as synchronicity.

00:13:01.893 --> 00:13:03.560 align:middle line:84%
When you're connecting
with higher being

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.977 align:middle line:84%
and you're moving yourself
into that higher state of mind,

00:13:05.977 --> 00:13:08.210 align:middle line:84%
you're enacting your will,
your purpose in the world,

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.127 align:middle line:84%
you're doing the right
things in the right way

00:13:10.127 --> 00:13:14.090 align:middle line:84%
for the right reason, the
timing of things just works out.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:15.770 align:middle line:84%
It's like you
don't have to push.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.440 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to make
things really happen,

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.808 align:middle line:90%
because they just happen.

00:13:19.808 --> 00:13:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And when we go to
the magical realms,

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.308 align:middle line:84%
it's what I call the
difference between operant

00:13:23.308 --> 00:13:24.620 align:middle line:90%
versus transcendent magic.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Operant magic is
I'm doing the spell

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.000 align:middle line:84%
to get the right lover, the
right car, the right job.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Transcendent magic is
I'm working on myself

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.180 align:middle line:84%
to bring myself to a
higher state of being

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.940 align:middle line:84%
so that the right
lover is drawn to me,

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.120 align:middle line:84%
the right job is drawn to me,
the right car comes my way.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have to
chase those things.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.090 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: No, you don't.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Do you mind if I give one
example in my own life

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:44.920 align:middle line:84%
where that happened
that was so beautiful?

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.650 align:middle line:90%
I'll make it brief.

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.880 align:middle line:84%
I was speaking with my teachers
in the other realms, right?

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.522 align:middle line:84%
And they were saying, do
something about the trees.

00:13:52.522 --> 00:13:53.480 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, who, me?

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.438 align:middle line:90%
Who are you talking to?

00:13:54.438 --> 00:13:56.660 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean, do
something about the trees?

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.180 align:middle line:84%
I love trees, but what am I
supposed to do about the trees?

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.930 align:middle line:84%
So a little time passed, and
suddenly this opportunity

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:05.540 align:middle line:84%
came to do a documentary
based on a Pulitzer

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Prize-winning series
called "Sierra in Peril."

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.830 align:middle line:90%
And so I said--

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:10.700 align:middle line:90%
I was with PBS.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.892 align:middle line:84%
I said, yes, let's
do this thing.

00:14:13.892 --> 00:14:16.430 align:middle line:84%
They said, let's do it, even
though the timing was way off,

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:18.290 align:middle line:90%
environment wasn't in anymore.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.670 align:middle line:84%
You know, recession
and all that.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:20.840 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Money came quicker
than anyone thought.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And when it was time to start
doing the project, everyone

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:29.720 align:middle line:84%
at every level of government,
every agency said yes.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And it ended up getting
four Emmy-nominated--

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:33.830 align:middle line:84%
I'd never done--
produced a documentary,

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:34.910 align:middle line:90%
and I wrote it too.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.650 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't done any
of that before.

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Every force lined
up that far exceeded

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.930 align:middle line:90%
everyone's expectations.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And I thought back
when it was all over,

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.630 align:middle line:84%
you do something
about the trees.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was all about the
trees and the water and air

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:51.410 align:middle line:90%
of the Sierra.

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:52.510 align:middle line:90%
And it was.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:53.690 align:middle line:90%
It was destined.

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:55.920 align:middle line:84%
It was programmed
in me, so to speak.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.080 align:middle line:90%
And there was nothing--

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.410 align:middle line:90%
no door was closed.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.717 align:middle line:84%
There was no moment
that wasn't opportune.

00:15:00.717 --> 00:15:02.550 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: You were perfectly
aligned with will,

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:04.740 align:middle line:84%
and everything just
moved perfectly in place.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:04.980 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.410 align:middle line:84%
That's one of those where I
just look to it as an example

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:08.760 align:middle line:90%
of perfect timing.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.380 align:middle line:84%
But what about the
rest of your life?

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.690 align:middle line:84%
How are you on that in
terms of synchronicity

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:13.872 align:middle line:90%
in living your own life?

00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:15.330 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: Boy, wouldn't
that be boring

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.890 align:middle line:84%
if everything was
constantly synchronous?

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:17.610 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:19.470 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: That's one of the things
I had to come to realize,

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:22.200 align:middle line:84%
is like, if I get a green
light every time everywhere I'm

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.070 align:middle line:84%
going, when am I going to stop
and mess with stuff, you know?

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:28.252 align:middle line:90%
And just take a break.

00:15:28.252 --> 00:15:29.460 align:middle line:90%
Where's the learning in that?

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.455 align:middle line:84%
If everything worked out
so perfectly and smoothly,

00:15:32.455 --> 00:15:33.330 align:middle line:90%
where's the learning?

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.247 align:middle line:90%
Where's the challenge?

00:15:34.247 --> 00:15:36.100 align:middle line:90%
Where's that move to grow?

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And so sometimes even those
blocks, even those hiccups

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:41.620 align:middle line:84%
are those things
we need to go, oh.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.420 align:middle line:90%
I hate this.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:42.660 align:middle line:90%
It sucks.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.680 align:middle line:90%
But wait a minute.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.790 align:middle line:84%
What if this is part of my
will, to endure this challenge?

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's as horrible
and awful as it is,

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:53.260 align:middle line:84%
what if my higher self
came in, said, this is it?

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.180 align:middle line:84%
This is what I
want to experience.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:56.670 align:middle line:90%
So embrace a higher self.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:57.600 align:middle line:90%
Go into that moment.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Go, wow.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.172 align:middle line:84%
I love this thing
that sucks so bad.

00:16:01.172 --> 00:16:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
get into this one.

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:04.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to hate
every moment of it.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And then get through it, and
you're like, oh, wait a minute.

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Because the more you
resist it, the more it's

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.437 align:middle line:90%
going to stick around.

00:16:09.437 --> 00:16:12.240 align:middle line:84%
But if you embrace it and go,
this really sucks, I hate it,

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.233 align:middle line:84%
but it's great, then
you get through it

00:16:14.233 --> 00:16:15.150 align:middle line:90%
and you're like, whoa.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:16.200 align:middle line:90%
What did I gain from that?

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.617 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: What did
I gain from that?

00:16:17.617 --> 00:16:19.380 align:middle line:90%
This happens a lot, especially--

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to be sexist
in saying this-- a lot

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:25.650 align:middle line:84%
with women who are
trying to attract or even

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.290 align:middle line:84%
project onto the notion
of a relationship.

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And when you're listening
to your higher self,

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.100 align:middle line:84%
we mistake those
messages thinking

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.890 align:middle line:84%
that's the be all and end
all, when oftentimes when

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:42.590 align:middle line:84%
we're given a message, it's
only for your next step in life.

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
this phenomena?

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.790 align:middle line:90%
Because people-- ugh!

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:46.983 align:middle line:90%
You said this was the one.

00:16:46.983 --> 00:16:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, this was the one to
learn this thing for right

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.590 align:middle line:90%
now, right?

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And some people say, oh,
that's just excuse making.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Tell us why that's
not excuse making.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.220 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: It's the
context of the moment.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes-- I've
actually seen this.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.740 align:middle line:84%
One of my craziest stories is I
remember spending time setting

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.150 align:middle line:90%
up a seance for a client.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.460 align:middle line:84%
We did this whole, like,
maybe a half hour--

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.880 align:middle line:84%
she was really nervous,
really kind of out of it.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.440 align:middle line:90%
Not into what we were doing.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.339 align:middle line:84%
She just wanted to
be out of there.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:13.139 align:middle line:90%
But we did it.

00:17:13.139 --> 00:17:14.200 align:middle line:90%
We finally got there.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.650 align:middle line:90%
We did this whole setup.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:16.930 align:middle line:90%
And we got one word.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.212 align:middle line:84%
I won't say the word,
but we got this one word,

00:17:19.212 --> 00:17:20.920 align:middle line:84%
and then the energy's
just, like-- whoop.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:21.720 align:middle line:90%
Vaporized.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.010 align:middle line:90%
We're like, what?

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.740 align:middle line:84%
But that one word she
left there leaving, like,

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:27.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry, frustrated.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.410 align:middle line:90%
I know, but that's it.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks later, she calls me,
that, this, and that and this.

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.250 align:middle line:84%
It all became because
of that one word.

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:35.050 align:middle line:90%
It did this.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:36.110 align:middle line:90%
It was life-changing.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.920 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, it was one
word that changed things.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And then other times when
we're working with somebody,

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.180 align:middle line:84%
they're looking for that
life-shattering, that life--

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:43.780 align:middle line:90%
big thing.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:44.590 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: The one thing.

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:46.048 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: And I get,
like, well, here.

00:17:46.048 --> 00:17:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Just work on this tiny
thing right here, right now.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And I see their shoulders
drop and they're frustrated.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:54.765 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I know, but just
do this one thing right now.

00:17:54.765 --> 00:17:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll
come back later.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:56.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, great.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to do
this one thing next.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And then you realize you
get to that big picture

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.898 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, stepping stone,
step by step by step.

00:18:03.898 --> 00:18:05.440 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And I think
that's important.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.520 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: It's a big boom.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.260 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah, that's
really important for people

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.060 align:middle line:90%
to realize.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants
the big enchilada.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.850 align:middle line:84%
They want the big
passion and dharma.

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:13.840 align:middle line:90%
They want the big love.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants the
big everything, right?

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And not stopping
to think, we have

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:18.790 align:middle line:90%
our own developmental process.

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And you really work with people
on the developmental process.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Let me ask you a quick question
before we go into the clairs,

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.080 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And that is, OK,
when you say seance,

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.960 align:middle line:84%
are you the medium
in the seance,

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.485 align:middle line:90%
or is someone else the medium?

00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:32.110 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: That's how I
love doing seances,

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:36.070 align:middle line:84%
is when I do a group
seance, it's two hours long.

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:37.643 align:middle line:90%
I'll start off and I'll do it.

00:18:37.643 --> 00:18:39.310 align:middle line:84%
But then I'll get
people using the Ouija

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:40.340 align:middle line:90%
boards and the automatic--

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.050 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah, it's so fun.

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:42.883 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: And then eventually,
s just step back

00:18:42.883 --> 00:18:44.317 align:middle line:90%
and I let everybody else do it.

00:18:44.317 --> 00:18:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And then they walk away
with the sense, wow.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:47.740 align:middle line:84%
I can connect with
the paranormal.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.425 align:middle line:90%
I have this ability too.

00:18:49.425 --> 00:18:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
my subversive--

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.010 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: I think that's great.

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.810 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I love that everyone
else gets to find

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:56.590 align:middle line:84%
their own empowerment
in that story

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:00.040 align:middle line:84%
rather than the one guru that's
doing everything and dispensing

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.333 align:middle line:84%
all the wisdom and so forth
through the beings that

00:19:02.333 --> 00:19:03.250 align:middle line:90%
are on the other side.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:03.990 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:05.320 align:middle line:84%
That's a great way
to go about it.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Let's start talking
about the clairs.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.440 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: All right.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that where we
get our ears pierced?

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:11.320 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Yeah,
something like that.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.250 align:middle line:90%
Accessories.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.313 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:14.313 --> 00:19:16.480 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
clairvoyants, clairsentience,

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.140 align:middle line:90%
clair everything.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Clairaudience.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:18.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.110 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Yeah, the clair senses.

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:23.740 align:middle line:84%
What I have come to understand
about this one, as children,

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:27.280 align:middle line:84%
we're born with our physical
senses and our clair senses.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And just like as kids, we
need to learn to develop

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.050 align:middle line:90%
our regular physical senses.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:34.005 align:middle line:84%
A baby may not be able
to focus on an object

00:19:34.005 --> 00:19:35.380 align:middle line:84%
till they get a
little bit older,

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.390 align:middle line:84%
because they're developing
their physical sight.

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And eventually
they'll make sense out

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.067 align:middle line:84%
of all the noise,
what's going on,

00:19:40.067 --> 00:19:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and be able to turn into words,
and those words become things

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.200 align:middle line:90%
that they understand.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.760 align:middle line:84%
But when we come to
the clair senses,

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.090 align:middle line:84%
we have them turned on too, just
as much as our physical senses,

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:51.700 align:middle line:84%
but we're not given the
training to use them.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.482 align:middle line:90%
If anything, the opposite.

00:19:53.482 --> 00:19:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Hey, Mom, I'm talking with
this little boy over here.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh, stop playing those games.

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, that
kid's using clairvoyance

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.090 align:middle line:84%
and clairaudience, the ability
to see and hear and communicate

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:07.275 align:middle line:84%
with this, even claircognizance
to communicate and understand.

00:20:07.275 --> 00:20:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And Mom and Dad are
just like, stop it.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:09.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
hear this anymore,

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.730 align:middle line:90%
because they're freaked out.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:11.530 align:middle line:90%
They're scared.

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:13.863 align:middle line:84%
They don't want the neighbors
to suddenly go, oh, you've

00:20:13.863 --> 00:20:15.100 align:middle line:90%
got one of those weird kids.

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:15.910 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:16.870 align:middle line:90%
Are you going to get them into--

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.940 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Tell you what, it will
crush that magic out of life.

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:19.900 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Uh-huh.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And then as we go through
life, maybe we're in adulthood,

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and then we see something
because something clicks on.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we go to work the
next day and we're like,

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.950 align:middle line:84%
I was in my room last night,
and this thing happened.

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And, oh, were you drinking
and smoking again?

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And then we get teased and
taunted, so we turn it off.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.710 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, we have
all of these abilities

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.360 align:middle line:90%
still within us, even as adults.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.200 align:middle line:90%
They're still there.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.730 align:middle line:90%
Just, we haven't developed them.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:46.840 align:middle line:90%
We haven't used them.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.550 align:middle line:90%
And we need to.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.010 align:middle line:90%
And so the clairs.

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Clairvoyance is
the ability to see.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.210 align:middle line:90%
It's what you have--

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:57.190 align:middle line:84%
it mimics the physical senses,
because it's like you can see.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:59.320 align:middle line:84%
But when you have
clairvoyance kick in,

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.350 align:middle line:84%
you may or may not actually
get a full visual image of it,

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:05.630 align:middle line:84%
but you may actually just be
registering visual information.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:06.430 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yes.

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that for some
people with their eyes open,

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:12.580 align:middle line:84%
they're actually seeing
wisps and entities

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.170 align:middle line:90%
and the story playing out.

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.750 align:middle line:84%
For other people like myself,
when my eyes are closed

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.230 align:middle line:90%
is when I see things.

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And so then it's projecting
that visual information there

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.317 align:middle line:84%
for you, or drawing it
from memory or whatnot.

00:21:23.317 --> 00:21:24.117 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Right.

00:21:24.117 --> 00:21:26.170 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So we're each
different even on that one.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:26.710 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Exactly.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:29.410 align:middle line:84%
It can come in different ways,
full-blown visual in the mind

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:32.720 align:middle line:84%
or just the visual impression
of information that's there.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Same way with clairaudience,
the ability to hear.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:37.580 align:middle line:84%
It can come as full-blown
sound, like somebody

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.920 align:middle line:84%
thinks they're having an
audible hallucination, going,

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:40.722 align:middle line:90%
what's going on?

00:21:40.722 --> 00:21:42.305 align:middle line:84%
And other people,
it's like, well, no.

00:21:42.305 --> 00:21:44.060 align:middle line:84%
I just kind of have
this feeling that I'm

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:48.050 align:middle line:84%
hearing a weird, fuzzy,
buzzing sound that's warbling.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Both are valid
expressions of it.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:52.058 align:middle line:90%
Then we get to clair--

00:21:52.058 --> 00:21:54.350 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: But let's talk about
the buzzy, chirping sound.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.740 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Sure.

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.630 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So even
through that, you're

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:58.310 align:middle line:90%
understanding the information.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:00.200 align:middle line:84%
You're saying even
in that case, you're

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.720 align:middle line:84%
understanding the nature of
the information coming through,

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.910 align:middle line:84%
even if it just sounds
wobbly and warbly.

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:05.220 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Right.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:05.630 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:07.172 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: In fact,
what's fun about that

00:22:07.172 --> 00:22:09.433 align:middle line:84%
is we can compare clairvoyants
with clairaudients.

00:22:09.433 --> 00:22:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Maybe somebody is
a visual learner

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:12.230 align:middle line:90%
versus an audible learner.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.027 align:middle line:84%
And an entity comes
into the room,

00:22:14.027 --> 00:22:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and the visual learner
might be going, well,

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:19.777 align:middle line:84%
I see this fuzzy, warbling,
kind of blue object.

00:22:19.777 --> 00:22:21.110 align:middle line:90%
And the other person's like, no.

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:24.410 align:middle line:84%
There's just this weird
buzzing, warbling sound.

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:26.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.455 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're both picking
up on the same information.

00:22:28.455 --> 00:22:30.830 align:middle line:84%
They're just interpreting it
with their own clair senses,

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.663 align:middle line:84%
and they're having the
same exact experience

00:22:32.663 --> 00:22:33.840 align:middle line:90%
in their own unique way.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.640 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.900 align:middle line:90%
So let's go on with the clairs.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:36.440 align:middle line:90%
We've got two.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.240 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Sure.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.070 align:middle line:10%
Claircognizance is kind of
that ability of knowing.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:42.170 align:middle line:10%
And it can come as
full-on telepathy,

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.590 align:middle line:10%
like you're having linear-worded
sentences coming through.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.963 align:middle line:84%
Or it can be just like,
how do I know what I know?

00:22:48.963 --> 00:22:50.630 align:middle line:84%
There are different
degrees of that one,

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:52.610 align:middle line:84%
but it's a great way
of communicating.

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's a great way of
trying to understand beings

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.300 align:middle line:90%
that you're working with.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Like, a lower level
being is going

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.690 align:middle line:84%
to stay the same thing over
and over and over and over

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:84%
and over and over
and over again.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:04.525 align:middle line:84%
A higher level being might
only say one or two words.

00:23:04.525 --> 00:23:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And I've noticed that the higher
the level of being, the less--

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:08.840 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: The less
they have to say.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:09.240 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.175 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: But it's so profound.

00:23:10.175 --> 00:23:10.920 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Absolutely.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.500 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: One word can
change everything.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.130 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: You're right.

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:13.760 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.635 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there's a
little blue one over here

00:23:15.635 --> 00:23:16.490 align:middle line:90%
right next to you.

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:17.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I'm just seeing him.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:19.020 align:middle line:90%
A little distracted.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:19.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.663 align:middle line:84%
Claircognizance
and clairsentience.

00:23:21.663 --> 00:23:23.330 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference
between those two?

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.622 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: Clairsentience from
what I've come to understand

00:23:25.622 --> 00:23:28.790 align:middle line:84%
is feeling the energy of a
room or the energy of what's

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:30.320 align:middle line:90%
going on around you.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.360 align:middle line:90%
Sentience is more of a feeling.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Not to be confused with
empathy, but the feeling.

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Like, you can feel if the
energy of the room is stagnant

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:41.750 align:middle line:84%
or if it's flowing or maybe
the vibe of the energy.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:42.950 align:middle line:90%
Is it a higher level vibe?

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:44.253 align:middle line:90%
Is it a lower level vibe?

00:23:44.253 --> 00:23:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And you can even use
your clairsentience

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.795 align:middle line:84%
to pick up if there are
anomalies in the room

00:23:47.795 --> 00:23:50.050 align:middle line:84%
like entities or
beings, thought forms.

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:52.880 align:middle line:84%
So clairsentience is a way
of getting out of the body

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.240 align:middle line:84%
and feeling the room and the
air and energy around you.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.170 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:57.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.240 align:middle line:90%
Continue on.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.270 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: And clairempathy.

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:00.920 align:middle line:84%
This is an important
one to develop.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.920 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: It's not one you
really hear much about.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:03.860 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Right.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.500 align:middle line:84%
It's basically able to
pick up the emotions

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:07.508 align:middle line:90%
of what's going on.

00:24:07.508 --> 00:24:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it differs
from clairsentience, where

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.910 align:middle line:84%
clairsentience is kind of like
a feel, where clairempathy

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:15.920 align:middle line:84%
is where you have
the emotional sense.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
that's really important

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.200 align:middle line:84%
is let's say you have a being
that you're talking with,

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.020 align:middle line:84%
and it's saying something,
but you're feeling

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.967 align:middle line:90%
at a different emotional level.

00:24:25.967 --> 00:24:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you a great
example of this one.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Doing a little bit
of seance on my own,

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.560 align:middle line:84%
I had these two skeletal, scary
figures walk into the room.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at them
and I'm like, OK,

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:36.500 align:middle line:90%
what are you two doing?

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Because the feeling
wasn't there.

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:41.600 align:middle line:84%
The empathy was not, I'm big
and scary and threatening.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.960 align:middle line:84%
The feeling was like, what
are you doing in here?

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:46.470 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:47.900 align:middle line:84%
They were more
kind of exploring.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.407 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, the image
doesn't match the feeling.

00:24:51.407 --> 00:24:52.740 align:middle line:90%
So I'm like, what are you doing?

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.377 align:middle line:84%
What are you kids Doing because
it felt like kids after a bit.

00:24:55.377 --> 00:24:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And they took off
their mask, and it's

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.592 align:middle line:84%
like a little boy and a
little girl playing Halloween.

00:24:59.592 --> 00:25:01.550 align:middle line:84%
They're like, but we
thought we had to be scary

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:02.800 align:middle line:90%
when we're doing these things.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.730 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, no.

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:07.400 align:middle line:84%
It was just so cute,
and it was so much fun.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Conversely, you may have
something coming through that

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:12.950 align:middle line:84%
may be trying to tell
you something good,

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:15.140 align:middle line:84%
but you're getting
that bad vibe.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.210 align:middle line:90%
The emotion just isn't right.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.250 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not
getting coherence

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:22.520 align:middle line:84%
between the information coming
through and the emotion,

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.740 align:middle line:90%
that should be a big red flag.

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:25.970 align:middle line:90%
You have to deal with it.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
sometimes a higher being

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:31.070 align:middle line:84%
will come in to do
some scary stuff,

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.630 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes
fear could be used

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:35.100 align:middle line:84%
to put people on the right
path and do the right thing.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a good
indicator all the time

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.290 align:middle line:84%
that you're dealing
with something bad,

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:43.490 align:middle line:84%
but look at all of the things
from the information coming

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:45.110 align:middle line:84%
through, the emotions
coming through,

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:49.680 align:middle line:84%
the causal outcome from it, and
what really is in it for you?

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.040 align:middle line:84%
Which is why I always tell
people to test and validate

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.510 align:middle line:90%
everything that comes through.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.360 align:middle line:84%
You have a spirit
saying this one thing.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.800 align:middle line:90%
Go out and test it.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.790 align:middle line:84%
If you're feeling something
off, go out and validate it.

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:03.200 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah, validation.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
important part here,

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:09.440 align:middle line:84%
because as people are starting
to develop those senses,

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:13.130 align:middle line:84%
it's so easily to be dissuaded--
so easy to be dissuaded

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:18.080 align:middle line:84%
to succumb to ridicule
or what from other people

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.390 align:middle line:84%
that don't go that
direction, and so forth.

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very important for
us to have self-validation.

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:26.540 align:middle line:90%
That is those little steps.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Those little bits of validation
are what give you the platform

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:31.070 align:middle line:90%
to grow and own it.

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:32.180 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.670 align:middle line:84%
One of the best things
I love telling people

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:36.620 align:middle line:84%
for validation of
your clair senses

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.640 align:middle line:90%
is trust the goosebump rush.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.440 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.020 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: You know, when you feel
that goosebump rush coming up

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.800 align:middle line:84%
over the back, that is actually
your visceral nervous system

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.350 align:middle line:84%
trying to communicate to
you through your body.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:49.730 align:middle line:90%
Hey, this is information.

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:50.823 align:middle line:90%
This is really valid.

00:26:50.823 --> 00:26:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
tell people in seance.

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:54.615 align:middle line:84%
When we're doing seance
and you get this impression

00:26:54.615 --> 00:26:56.332 align:middle line:84%
of something that
you want to say

00:26:56.332 --> 00:26:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and you're just about
to say it, then you

00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.690 align:middle line:84%
feel that goosebump
rush, that's when

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:02.900 align:middle line:84%
you know you should be saying
it, because that's validation.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.070 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Absolutely.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And then you can also, when
you're shown something--

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:10.770 align:middle line:84%
and say for example it is
of a precognitive nature.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:12.660 align:middle line:84%
That's just kind of
low-hanging fruit.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And then that thing happens
the next day or that person

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:16.340 align:middle line:90%
calls you in a few minutes.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.540 align:middle line:90%
Don't ignore those.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:18.950 align:middle line:90%
Those aren't coincidences.

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Start looking at those as
little moments of validation.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.200 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of validation
that's happening,

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.550 align:middle line:90%
we walk right past.

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:28.490 align:middle line:84%
We don't register or we
just kind of blow off.

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think in this
process of developing this,

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.675 align:middle line:84%
it's important not to blow
these coincidences off.

00:27:33.675 --> 00:27:34.475 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Right.

00:27:34.475 --> 00:27:37.940 align:middle line:84%
It's what they call the
believing and seeing dynamic.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.600 align:middle line:84%
You have to believe
in it a little bit.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.017 align:middle line:84%
So believe in
yourself that you're

00:27:41.017 --> 00:27:43.400 align:middle line:84%
getting some sort of information
that you can validate.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Then you go out and you prove
it, and now you've seen it.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:47.600 align:middle line:90%
You see it's there.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, that actually goes back
and reinforces your belief

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.670 align:middle line:84%
so you believe it
a little bit more.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:54.838 align:middle line:84%
Then you go out and
you can see it more.

00:27:54.838 --> 00:27:55.880 align:middle line:90%
And then you see it more.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.300 align:middle line:90%
That validates even more.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.260 align:middle line:84%
I've developed that into
a bit of a practice.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.552 align:middle line:90%
Let's say using a pendulum.

00:28:02.552 --> 00:28:04.010 align:middle line:84%
So if you use a
pendulum and you're

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:06.218 align:middle line:84%
getting yes or no
responses-- and I've

00:28:06.218 --> 00:28:08.510 align:middle line:84%
got some techniques to develop
to work with a pendulum,

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:09.980 align:middle line:84%
but let's say you
finally develop

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.260 align:middle line:90%
your yes or no responses.

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.760 align:middle line:84%
You're asking questions that
you already know the answer to.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.050 align:middle line:90%
You know this is a gray table.

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:16.460 align:middle line:90%
My feet are on the floor.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.770 align:middle line:90%
My hair is blue.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:20.810 align:middle line:90%
You're able to calibrate that.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Then you go out and
you ask a question

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:25.010 align:middle line:84%
you don't know the answer
to, and then you put it away.

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:26.608 align:middle line:90%
Go out, test, and validate it.

00:28:26.608 --> 00:28:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Then you keep doing that, some
yes, no answers that you know.

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And then the answers you don't
know, you test and validate.

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, you're
going to notice

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:37.880 align:middle line:84%
inside something that feels yes
and something that feels no.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.560 align:middle line:90%
And that is your intuitive hit.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:41.870 align:middle line:84%
That's an intuitive response
coming from the gut,

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:43.410 align:middle line:90%
that visceral nervous system.

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the
brain is going, ick.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.720 align:middle line:90%
Ick, no.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:48.780 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't make any sense.

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:49.613 align:middle line:90%
This isn't rational.

00:28:49.613 --> 00:28:50.690 align:middle line:90%
This isn't logical.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:51.745 align:middle line:90%
It's dumb.

00:28:51.745 --> 00:28:53.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
believe that one.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.780 align:middle line:90%
So that's where we look at that.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:55.580 align:middle line:90%
We go, OK.

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, my brain says,
logical reasoning

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:58.705 align:middle line:90%
says this isn't valid.

00:28:58.705 --> 00:29:00.830 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, your intuition
is going, ding, ding,

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:02.090 align:middle line:90%
ding, ding, ding.

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:03.265 align:middle line:90%
So you do the pendulum.

00:29:03.265 --> 00:29:04.640 align:middle line:84%
You build your
yes, no responses.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.130 align:middle line:84%
You go out in the world
and go, oh, that was right.

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:08.450 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that was right.

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:12.470 align:middle line:84%
That builds that trust between
the visceral and the cognitive

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:16.350 align:middle line:84%
so that now you know when
you feel this one thing,

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:17.150 align:middle line:90%
there we go.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:19.493 align:middle line:84%
That's my validation, and
that's all I need to do.

00:29:19.493 --> 00:29:20.660 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: That's all you need.

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And the word you use
is exactly the one

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.860 align:middle line:84%
I was going to bring up,
trust, which even spills over

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.570 align:middle line:90%
into faith of sorts.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:29.450 align:middle line:84%
So I totally have faith that
it's all going to work through.

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:31.250 align:middle line:84%
I'll listen to the
signs along the way,

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:32.958 align:middle line:84%
and I'll end up in
the right destination.

00:29:32.958 --> 00:29:34.850 align:middle line:90%
That's a matter of almost faith.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:37.430 align:middle line:84%
But there's a fine line
between trust and faith.

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:38.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure somebody could--

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:41.520 align:middle line:84%
a linguistic scholar could
go ahead and break that down

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.320 align:middle line:90%
for us.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:45.110 align:middle line:84%
But I find the
feeling of trust moves

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:47.460 align:middle line:84%
into the feeling of
faith, so to speak.

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
about a pendulum validating

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.330 align:middle line:84%
what you're talking about, when
I had Conscious Media Network,

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:55.620 align:middle line:84%
we'd go to these big
conferences, right?

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual life expo
or whatever it was.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And I have to try to
really quickly get

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:03.350 align:middle line:84%
people to agree to an
interview between things.

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:05.390 align:middle line:90%
And it's a madhouse, right?

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:07.890 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has schedules to meet.

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And it got so crazy I thought,
I can't do this with my mind.

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:14.600 align:middle line:84%
So I'd get a pendulum out, go
over the faces on the roster,

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:18.000 align:middle line:84%
and try to disconnect what my
mind knew about the people.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.220 align:middle line:90%
And I was always surprised.

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- but
that's not someone

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:24.620 align:middle line:84%
I would normally choose
from what I'm interested in.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Or someone else, I absolutely
need to talk to her.

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:28.570 align:middle line:90%
And it'd say no.

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, it would turn out
something interesting

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:33.230 align:middle line:84%
like their plane was leaving
right after their talk,

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:35.400 align:middle line:84%
and we would have never
been able to schedule it,

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.710 align:middle line:90%
I'd find out after.

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:39.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying how perfect
it is if you leave it

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:40.820 align:middle line:84%
to this higher
part of your being

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.410 align:middle line:90%
to discern this information.

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:43.560 align:middle line:90%
It worked like a dream.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:45.750 align:middle line:84%
It was so easy to work at
conferences after that.

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:46.550 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Absolutely

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:46.850 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:48.500 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: Pendulums are a
great way of building

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.520 align:middle line:90%
that paranormal awareness.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.320 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.540 align:middle line:90%
And anyone can do it.

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.988 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can work with them.

00:30:52.988 --> 00:30:54.530 align:middle line:84%
What are some of
the other modalities

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:57.160 align:middle line:84%
you like to work with
besides the pendulum?

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.408 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: Besides a pendulum,
I love the black mirror.

00:30:59.408 --> 00:31:00.950 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Oh, well,
tell us about the--

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:03.830 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: The black mirror is
my favorite seance tool.

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:06.440 align:middle line:84%
It was just using it
last night, in fact.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:10.020 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing more than just
a piece of paint and glass.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:10.820 align:middle line:90%
It's all it is.

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:11.750 align:middle line:90%
Just a frame.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:14.453 align:middle line:84%
You go to a hobby
store, and you can just

00:31:14.453 --> 00:31:16.370 align:middle line:84%
buy one of those picture
frames, and you spray

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:18.050 align:middle line:84%
paint the back of
it with black paint.

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:19.320 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:23.270 align:middle line:84%
But in the ritual setting,
when you get your mind tuned

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:25.800 align:middle line:90%
into it, it becomes a portal.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.250 align:middle line:84%
It will connect you
to other realms,

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:30.140 align:middle line:90%
other worlds, other people.

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And they can come through
now, and you can connect.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Energy goes back
and forth both ways.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Communication goes
both ways through it.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Connect with higher beings,
exchanging energy through it,

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:43.340 align:middle line:84%
and getting these higher
level transmissions

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:44.480 align:middle line:90%
through the black mirror.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:45.470 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Why the black mirror?

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:46.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, does it get
to the point you

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:47.780 align:middle line:90%
don't need the black mirror?

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.460 align:middle line:84%
You just set your
mind in that place

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.380 align:middle line:90%
and you can do it anyway, right?

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.510 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: I love the
visual dimensional shift

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:55.490 align:middle line:84%
that it gives,
because when you look

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:57.200 align:middle line:84%
through the black
mirror in a dark room,

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.550 align:middle line:90%
it does look like a mirror.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:31:59.930 align:middle line:90%
You can still see the room.

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:01.700 align:middle line:84%
You can still see
yourself in there.

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:05.600 align:middle line:84%
But you can transform
your visual perception

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.000 align:middle line:90%
from, like, 3D to 4D to 5D.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.072 align:middle line:84%
I can't explain
it, because there

00:32:11.072 --> 00:32:12.530 align:middle line:84%
are times where
the mirror is here,

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:14.870 align:middle line:84%
but then when I'm working
with it, it's here.

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:16.610 align:middle line:90%
It will shift in size.

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes
it'll go small.

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.750 align:middle line:84%
The colors that come
through, I can never

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:24.710 align:middle line:84%
tell you if they're green, blue,
brown, or yellow, or whatnot.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:26.890 align:middle line:90%
But the colors are so vivid.

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:29.790 align:middle line:84%
They're not a color I've
ever seen in my entire life.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:30.590 align:middle line:90%
It's vivid.

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:31.390 align:middle line:90%
It's bright.

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:32.570 align:middle line:90%
It's in there.

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:35.210 align:middle line:84%
If you want to do shapeshifting
work, imagine this.

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:36.800 align:middle line:84%
You can stand in
front of the mirror

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.467 align:middle line:84%
and see yourself how you want to
see yourself, like as an animal

00:32:39.467 --> 00:32:41.370 align:middle line:90%
form or an ideal body shape.

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And you can see it transform
in the mirror, which

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:46.790 align:middle line:84%
affects the ethereal body,
which then goes and affects

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:47.970 align:middle line:90%
the physical body.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:49.670 align:middle line:84%
So now you're
integrating, like, if you

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:51.170 align:middle line:84%
want to be the
bear so you're more

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.500 align:middle line:84%
big and bold and
boisterous, you see yourself

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.500 align:middle line:90%
as a bear in the mirror.

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:55.375 align:middle line:90%
Then you can feel it.

00:32:55.375 --> 00:32:56.240 align:middle line:90%
You absorb it.

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.770 align:middle line:90%
And you're now the bear.

00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:59.210 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
you can do with--

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:01.550 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So is this a
long initiation process,

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:05.330 align:middle line:84%
or can anybody go and-- what
you say, go to a hobby store,

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:08.630 align:middle line:84%
get a frame that has a
background to it, right?

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And you paint the
background black.

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:10.700 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Yep.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:11.180 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: That's it?

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:11.720 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: That's it.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.520 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And so you go into a dark
room or a darkened room.

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:15.650 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Mm-hmm.

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:16.010 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: OK.

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:17.343 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: I prefer completely dark.

00:33:17.343 --> 00:33:19.490 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And then where do
you set your intention?

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:20.952 align:middle line:84%
Where does your
mind go with this?

00:33:20.952 --> 00:33:22.910 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: You definitely
want to set sacred space.

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:25.035 align:middle line:84%
You definitely want to set
sacred space around you,

00:33:25.035 --> 00:33:26.060 align:middle line:90%
within you.

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.760 align:middle line:84%
When I teach it, I've got a
five-week course where we go

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.220 align:middle line:90%
through a whole process--

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.390 align:middle line:84%
I might turn it into
a weekend workshop--

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:35.510 align:middle line:84%
where we go through a whole
process of learning to tune in,

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:37.760 align:middle line:84%
learning to connect,
learning to ground and go

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.013 align:middle line:90%
through the mirror and be there.

00:33:40.013 --> 00:33:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Raymond Moody, though,
has a different method.

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:42.710 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah, what's his?

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:44.090 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: He's got what
I would describe

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:45.620 align:middle line:84%
as a little "Harry
Potter" closet

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:46.910 align:middle line:90%
with a black mirror in there.

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:47.870 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Raymond Moody?

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:48.800 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Raymond Moody.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.000 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: He does the
black mirror thing?

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:50.810 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: He does.

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:52.640 align:middle line:90%
He calls it a psychomantium.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:53.480 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: I love it.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.060 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: And what he'll do is
if somebody has experienced

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.687 align:middle line:84%
someone who has recently died
and they're feeling lost,

00:33:58.687 --> 00:34:00.770 align:middle line:84%
and they haven't maybe
worked through their grief,

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:02.600 align:middle line:84%
they'll spend some time
outside of the room,

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.910 align:middle line:84%
talking about this person,
connecting with their feelings

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:06.035 align:middle line:90%
and their memories of them.

00:34:06.035 --> 00:34:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And then he'll invite them into
this place, which is sacred

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:10.429 align:middle line:84%
and they're at a
higher state of mind.

00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:12.679 align:middle line:84%
And to be there and
think about that person

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:14.030 align:middle line:90%
and connect with that energy.

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they'll
see that person

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:17.239 align:middle line:84%
come through the
mirror or other people

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:18.260 align:middle line:90%
will come through the mirror.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.343 align:middle line:90%
They'll have a connection.

00:34:19.343 --> 00:34:20.570 align:middle line:90%
They'll have a conversation.

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:23.989 align:middle line:84%
They'll be in the presence of
that person again for that time

00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:26.179 align:middle line:84%
that they're in that room
with the black mirror,

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:29.701 align:middle line:84%
because it distorts our sense
of reality, our sense of mind.

00:34:29.701 --> 00:34:31.159 align:middle line:84%
But if we're tuned
into that person

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:32.750 align:middle line:84%
that we want to connect
with, we remember

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.560 align:middle line:84%
what it feels like to
be in their presence

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.679 align:middle line:84%
and what it was
like to be love--

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:39.770 align:middle line:84%
feel that love with them, then
all of a sudden, we're there.

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And a black mirror helps
shift our perspective

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:44.960 align:middle line:84%
so we can actually perceive
them and experience them again.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.475 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Interesting.

00:34:46.475 --> 00:34:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And what about the notion of
the fear factor of people where

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:54.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm new age and I want to
do everything in light,

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:56.210 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to
be in a darkened room,

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to
be with a dark mirror.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And you have very
two distinct mindsets

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:05.230 align:middle line:84%
in the field of
paranormal and phenomena.

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:08.010 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them-- there's a
whole group of ascension folks,

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:10.960 align:middle line:84%
and then there are the
magic folks, and so forth.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.070 align:middle line:84%
But one thing that is
common to both groups

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:16.980 align:middle line:84%
is there can be fear when
engaging with these things.

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And often, that fear
comes from other times,

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:21.430 align:middle line:84%
but is still contained
within the being.

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:22.897 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that phenomena

00:35:22.897 --> 00:35:24.480 align:middle line:84%
for those who are
listening, thinking,

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.730 align:middle line:84%
I'd kind of like to do it,
but it kind of sounds scary.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:27.630 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: Fear is an
important thing

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:29.880 align:middle line:84%
to address when we're talking
about the paranormal and

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.100 align:middle line:84%
paranormal awareness,
and it's because we

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:35.640 align:middle line:84%
were brought up, all of us in
this society and this culture,

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.500 align:middle line:90%
to be afraid of the paranormal.

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.940 align:middle line:90%
We've seen the TV shows.

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:39.857 align:middle line:90%
We've seen the movies.

00:35:39.857 --> 00:35:42.065 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Well, "The Exorcist"
certainly nailed the lid

00:35:42.065 --> 00:35:43.560 align:middle line:84%
on that coffin for
a lot of people.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.527 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] And "Carrie."

00:35:44.527 --> 00:35:46.110 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: We've had the
community leaders

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:47.497 align:middle line:90%
tell us this is evil and bad.

00:35:47.497 --> 00:35:49.830 align:middle line:84%
We've had the church leaders
pounded it into our brains.

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:52.620 align:middle line:84%
Then when we talk to
our friends, our peers,

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:54.300 align:middle line:84%
we get laughed at
and ridiculed, and we

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.383 align:middle line:90%
don't want to be cast out.

00:35:55.383 --> 00:35:57.253 align:middle line:90%
Our parents tell us to shut up.

00:35:57.253 --> 00:35:59.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to hear it
anymore, none of this.

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:03.750 align:middle line:84%
So we grew up with fear, and
we instantly associate anything

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:06.210 align:middle line:90%
with the paranormal fear-based.

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And let me give you an example
of how this is unfortunate.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're at home, just
having a nice, quiet night.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
something moves on the table.

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:19.568 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have a glass
of water on the table,

00:36:19.568 --> 00:36:21.360 align:middle line:84%
and you see the ripples
on the water glass.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.920 align:middle line:90%
And you're like, what is that?

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And then all of the sudden,
the table that it's on

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:25.340 align:middle line:90%
starts to go--

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:26.640 align:middle line:90%
you're like [GASP].

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.820 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go, oh, ah,
we need to call the exorcist.

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.320 align:middle line:90%
We need to get them in here.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, it probably is just
some little kid going to--

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.640 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Passing through.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.015 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: Hey, let's
play with this.

00:36:37.015 --> 00:36:38.020 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:39.990 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
call the exorcist,

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:41.220 align:middle line:90%
get a kid out of there?

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.300 align:middle line:90%
It's like--

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.160 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: Because it's
so misunderstood.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, the multidimensionality,
I've said this many times.

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:50.160 align:middle line:84%
A civilization could
live in the palm

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.810 align:middle line:90%
of your hand in one dimension.

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And if we could see all the
dimensions interpenetrating

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:57.870 align:middle line:84%
where we are right now, all
the hosts of different kind

00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:59.910 align:middle line:84%
of beings in the space
between you and I,

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:01.050 align:middle line:90%
we'd probably go mad.

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:03.480 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason
dimensions are full stop.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.610 align:middle line:84%
You don't bleed
through to the others

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:08.160 align:middle line:84%
unless you have certain talents
and skills and choose to.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:08.370 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Right.

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:08.760 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right?

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.780 align:middle line:90%
So there's a reason.

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is our
protective shield

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:14.310 align:middle line:84%
is to not be able to go insane
with everything going on.

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:16.440 align:middle line:84%
That's not our
dimension to learn in.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.550 align:middle line:90%
That's not our playground.

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:18.960 align:middle line:90%
It's someone else's playground.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.630 align:middle line:84%
But like you're saying, not
to be afraid of the fact

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:23.670 align:middle line:84%
that other people are
on their playground that

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:25.125 align:middle line:90%
might affect ours to an extent.

00:37:25.125 --> 00:37:25.440 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Right.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.110 align:middle line:84%
It's just, we live in a
completely paranormal world.

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:31.800 align:middle line:84%
I do think the paranormal is
all around us all the time.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.510 align:middle line:90%
Spirits are everywhere.

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:35.490 align:middle line:84%
In this room here, there's
a few little things

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:36.570 align:middle line:90%
that aren't human.

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:38.850 align:middle line:84%
There is one person just
kind of walking around.

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:39.810 align:middle line:90%
He's just over here.

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:41.610 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, you saw
a little blue thing.

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:43.350 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And if we're afraid of
it, we're tuning it out.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:46.470 align:middle line:90%
We're blocking it out.

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:49.170 align:middle line:84%
We're not inviting it
as a part of our life.

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:50.070 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Like, so much could be
going on that it's just

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.080 align:middle line:90%
hard to tune it out.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.180 align:middle line:90%
There's just so much out there.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.370 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And sometimes it can be
disconcerting when you're first

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:57.600 align:middle line:90%
waking up to all this.

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I remember a few
decades ago when

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.340 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of really
awakening myself to all this,

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:04.080 align:middle line:84%
someone used to
pet my hair a lot.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.520 align:middle line:90%
They'd come and they'd just be--

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.020 align:middle line:84%
I could feel them
petting my hair.

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And at first I'd kind
of get the shivers.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought,
well, that's OK.

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.910 align:middle line:84%
You're not doing
anybody any harm.

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And then after a year
or two, that wore off

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:15.390 align:middle line:90%
and other phenomena happened.

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think once
you open this door,

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:19.860 align:middle line:84%
it's perfectly natural
to start becoming

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:23.100 align:middle line:84%
aware of what's surrounding
you that we have been blind to.

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you
strike me as a--

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:29.880 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a better word,
from your deeper past

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.340 align:middle line:84%
more of a Druidic
type of magician.

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk
about the way magic

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:36.970 align:middle line:84%
interfaces with all of
this and what that means.

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:38.885 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
afraid of the word magic,

00:38:38.885 --> 00:38:40.260 align:middle line:84%
because they're
doing-- they have

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.060 align:middle line:90%
a connotation of black magic.

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:47.850 align:middle line:84%
White magic is certainly as
powerful, if not more powerful

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:48.760 align:middle line:90%
in the end.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.670 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that, where
magic comes into all of this.

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:52.470 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:56.100 align:middle line:84%
It's all a part of it, because
the way I refer to runes,

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.530 align:middle line:84%
my primary way of
working, is that runes

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:00.900 align:middle line:84%
are the subtle connections
between the subtle parts

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:03.567 align:middle line:84%
of our mind and the
subtle parts of reality.

00:39:03.567 --> 00:39:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And if we can tune into
those runes and tune

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.910 align:middle line:84%
into that subtle
part of our mind,

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:09.030 align:middle line:84%
we can then shift
how the reality

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:11.370 align:middle line:84%
is that we are experiencing
and that we're working with.

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And in essence, that's
all that magic is,

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.430 align:middle line:84%
is whenever we have an idea that
we want to manifest and come

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:19.830 align:middle line:84%
into the world, we
do the things that

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:22.480 align:middle line:84%
make it seem possible
and seem real to us.

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.640 align:middle line:90%
And that's what magic is.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And we go out into the
world and we make it happen.

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And so light magic, dark magic,
white magic, black magic,

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:33.790 align:middle line:90%
all that doesn't matter.

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:36.610 align:middle line:84%
What really matters is what
do we have going on here.

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:39.327 align:middle line:84%
What is it we want to
see, feel, and experience?

00:39:39.327 --> 00:39:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And then when we go
into the ritual chamber,

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.570 align:middle line:90%
there's some meditation, sure.

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:44.460 align:middle line:84%
There's some setting
of sacred space

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.470 align:middle line:84%
so that we get our
mind in tune to things.

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:49.393 align:middle line:84%
But it's really coming down
to that moment of experience.

00:39:49.393 --> 00:39:50.310 align:middle line:90%
What do we experience?

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:51.110 align:middle line:90%
What do we see?

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:51.960 align:middle line:90%
What is there?

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:52.500 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to put that
energy into the runes,

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:57.870 align:middle line:84%
into this amulet, into the
talisman, whatever it is.

00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to
let it do its thing,

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:02.190 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm going to go off
into the world and do my thing.

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:03.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's all magic is.

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:04.083 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah, it is.

00:40:04.083 --> 00:40:06.387 align:middle line:84%
It's really just
the manifestation,

00:40:06.387 --> 00:40:08.220 align:middle line:84%
the manifestation beyond
the physical realm.

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:11.010 align:middle line:84%
You can say from the paranormal
realm into the physical realm.

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people will say,
wow, they have a magical life.

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's just what
you said a moment ago.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:19.590 align:middle line:84%
It's being in synchronicity with
all of these different aspects

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:22.210 align:middle line:84%
of self that allow these
things to come to fruition,

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:24.990 align:middle line:84%
which many would perceive
to be against the odds.

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's called
magic, just because it's

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:32.318 align:middle line:84%
against what we expect here in
these third-dimensional bodies.

00:40:32.318 --> 00:40:34.110 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
I wanted to talk about

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:36.630 align:middle line:84%
before we wrap our
conversation up

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:40.620 align:middle line:84%
is what I said in the very
beginning, which is these times

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:43.710 align:middle line:84%
right now have a very
chaotic feeling to them,

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and my understanding
from Vedic astrology,

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:48.960 align:middle line:84%
this could go on for several
more years, this time of coming

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.500 align:middle line:84%
unglued so we can reconstitute
ourselves collectively

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.850 align:middle line:90%
and individually.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:59.250 align:middle line:84%
But these crazy
energies, the confusion,

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:01.770 align:middle line:84%
the conflicting
information in the field

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:03.870 align:middle line:90%
is affecting the Earth herself.

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's a feedback
loop between us.

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:09.690 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk to people about
how we can start taking back

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:12.300 align:middle line:84%
our subtle energies,
how we can start

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.480 align:middle line:84%
reframing them to
embody ourselves again

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:16.740 align:middle line:90%
in a more powerful way.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:17.710 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Absolutely.

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:18.510 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:20.130 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of
stuff going on.

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I'm trying
to help people develop

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:23.980 align:middle line:84%
more of their awareness
of the paranormal,

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.730 align:middle line:84%
what's going on around
us, is if you are

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:30.150 align:middle line:84%
unaware of the influence
upon you and upon the world

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:31.980 align:middle line:84%
around you, you
are subject to it.

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:34.060 align:middle line:84%
You just think, that's
the way the world works,

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:35.160 align:middle line:90%
so that's how it is.

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm under the
belief that 90%

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.540 align:middle line:84%
of the thoughts and
emotions we experience

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:41.220 align:middle line:90%
are not self-generated.

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:42.693 align:middle line:84%
They come from the
world around us.

00:41:42.693 --> 00:41:44.610 align:middle line:84%
We're going to walk
through energy fields that

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:46.140 align:middle line:84%
have different vibes
to it, different--

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:46.940 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Dream world, even.

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:47.430 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Dream world.

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:48.230 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:50.700 align:middle line:84%
We're going to walk through
reality tunnels and reality

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:54.300 align:middle line:84%
bubbles that exhibit a whole
state of reality in existence,

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and it causes that
feedback loop.

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Within all of that, though,
are various entities,

00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:00.570 align:middle line:90%
various beings.

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:02.520 align:middle line:90%
Most are human-generated.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.210 align:middle line:90%
They like tulpas or egregores.

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:05.460 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Egregores, absolutely.

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.252 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: Where we have
our collective belief,

00:42:07.252 --> 00:42:08.880 align:middle line:90%
our collective fear.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And then they're going to
go to those minds of people

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.520 align:middle line:84%
who are unaware of them
and then whisper, hey,

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.510 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't it be a
good idea to do this?

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:17.760 align:middle line:90%
Because you'll get this power.

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:18.750 align:middle line:90%
You'll get this money.

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:21.600 align:middle line:84%
You'll get this recognition,
so go do that thing.

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:24.330 align:middle line:84%
They don't know that it's
not a self-generated thought

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:25.200 align:middle line:90%
or emotion.

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:28.135 align:middle line:84%
They're going to go, wow, I want
to be awesome for doing this,

00:42:28.135 --> 00:42:29.260 align:middle line:90%
so I'm going to go do that.

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, it's
caused a detriment

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:32.430 align:middle line:90%
to so many other people.

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
but yeah, hey, look

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.080 align:middle line:90%
what you're getting out of it.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:37.352 align:middle line:84%
So there's this weird
cyclical thing going on.

00:42:37.352 --> 00:42:39.810 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: We've got some weird
egregores out there right now.

00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:40.710 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Big time.

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Big time egregores
all over the place.

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
they are whispering

00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:47.610 align:middle line:84%
into the minds of some
people in powerful positions.

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:48.420 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Oh my gosh.

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:49.230 align:middle line:90%
Boy, are they.

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:50.700 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: It's really scary.

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And so if we can
develop our awareness

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:55.650 align:middle line:84%
to be aware, like, ooh,
there's an egregore, there's

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:58.740 align:middle line:84%
a tulpa messing with
these people there, ooh,

00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.770 align:middle line:84%
there's this energy pattern that
I'm feeling that's not mine,

00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:04.560 align:middle line:84%
we go into the state
of meta consciousness

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:08.100 align:middle line:84%
where we are aware of our
awareness, where we are

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:10.760 align:middle line:84%
like the inner observer
where we can know,

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.510 align:middle line:84%
oh, I just walked
through an energy field.

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:13.450 align:middle line:90%
That's not my energy.

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:14.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't want it

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm hearing this
whisper in my mind.

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm hearing this influence.

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:19.148 align:middle line:84%
Nope, I don't want to
deal with that one.

00:43:19.148 --> 00:43:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they're acting that
way because they're

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:21.930 align:middle line:90%
getting this influence?

00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:22.380 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.880 align:middle line:90%
I know to step away from that.

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.830 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
that awareness,

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:28.200 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have
that ability to see

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.420 align:middle line:84%
the paranormal around you
through your clairvoyance,

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:32.128 align:middle line:84%
you're clairaudience,
your clairgustance,

00:43:32.128 --> 00:43:34.773 align:middle line:84%
you aren't tuning into that,
you don't know what's happening.

00:43:34.773 --> 00:43:35.940 align:middle line:90%
You don't know what's yours.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.233 align:middle line:90%
You don't know what's external.

00:43:37.233 --> 00:43:39.400 align:middle line:84%
You just think, well, this
is the right thing to do.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.820 align:middle line:84%
This is the only thing to
do, so I'm going to go do it.

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, people
could be getting hurt.

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Your life could be falling
apart, and you don't know why.

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:49.078 align:middle line:84%
It's because the subtle
influence comes in.

00:43:49.078 --> 00:43:51.120 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: So to know where
those incongruities are,

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.490 align:middle line:84%
it's like, hey, this
is passing through.

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:55.770 align:middle line:84%
But your body's
responding to-- your body

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:57.600 align:middle line:90%
has massive intelligence.

00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:00.660 align:middle line:90%
Your body is tightening up and--

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.880 align:middle line:84%
I hear you, but this
doesn't feel good.

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:03.930 align:middle line:90%
Honoring that.

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:06.180 align:middle line:84%
These are the things
we bypass a lot too.

00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy when you're in a
state of mass confusion, when

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:11.640 align:middle line:84%
literally the
masses are confused,

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.550 align:middle line:84%
because we're being given
such conflicting, manipulative

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:17.190 align:middle line:84%
information from so
many sources now.

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:19.830 align:middle line:84%
So in confusion, you can
be easily programmed.

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:22.110 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very
important now to listen

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:25.290 align:middle line:84%
to your body, the
body's intelligence.

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:27.660 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: That's what's
great about the pendulum,

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:30.580 align:middle line:84%
is because your body has that
intelligence, that intuitive

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:31.380 align:middle line:90%
response.

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.440 align:middle line:84%
It can connect to that
paranormal situation.

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And you hear somebody saying,
you should go do this one.

00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:38.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, check into your body.

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Are you getting the
yes, no response?

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:43.050 align:middle line:84%
If you're not getting
that clarity then when

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:44.820 align:middle line:84%
you go back to the
pendulum, you're

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:47.040 align:middle line:84%
going back to the
ideomuscular responses that

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.650 align:middle line:84%
are connected to the
subconscious parts of your body

00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:52.500 align:middle line:84%
so that the conscious mind
can then finally pick up

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.210 align:middle line:84%
on that one, because
you're finally

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:56.700 align:middle line:84%
seeing the movement of the
pendulum that goes, no.

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:58.680 align:middle line:84%
That's not the
right thing to do.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.390 align:middle line:90%
And I don't need to know why.

00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:02.080 align:middle line:84%
I just-- it's not the
right thing to do.

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.970 align:middle line:84%
It's like, because
intuition, the pendulum.

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:04.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:06.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm not following that, so
wherever that came from,

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't want that.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:08.880 align:middle line:90%
Go away.

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:09.480 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Right.

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And just one other teeny
little story before we go.

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.302 align:middle line:84%
I used to have a
hypnotherapy clinic,

00:45:13.302 --> 00:45:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and I really loved working with
performance issues in terms

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:18.600 align:middle line:84%
of athletes and
such, but also I took

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.370 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people into other
life journeys and so forth.

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:22.920 align:middle line:84%
But one thing that
I started doing

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.530 align:middle line:84%
that was fascinating
to your point was I

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:27.330 align:middle line:84%
worked with the
ideomotor response--

00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:31.140 align:middle line:84%
classic, classic
hypnosis technique--

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:34.240 align:middle line:84%
without words where I
project mind to mind.

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And then their bodies would
twitch their yeses and nos

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:40.140 align:middle line:84%
to me and develop a dialogue
with their conscious mind not

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:41.100 align:middle line:90%
knowing anything.

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was amazing
in the effects

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.960 align:middle line:84%
that it had, because
there was nothing

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:50.080 align:middle line:84%
to interfere with their deeper
desires to perform or whatnot.

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And so it's just
like the pendulum.

00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:53.057 align:middle line:90%
It showed itself.

00:45:53.057 --> 00:45:53.890 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: That's right.

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:55.860 align:middle line:90%
We're all connected.

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:56.670 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Exactly.

00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:58.410 align:middle line:84%
I absolutely loved
working like that.

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:00.827 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts
before we go, Kaedrich?

00:46:00.827 --> 00:46:02.910 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: The final thoughts
that I want for everyone

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:06.060 align:middle line:84%
to be able to learn
is to take some time,

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:08.550 align:middle line:84%
no matter what practice
you have for spirituality,

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:12.210 align:middle line:84%
no matter what paths you
follow, just with you,

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:13.530 align:middle line:90%
take time to go in.

00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:15.330 align:middle line:90%
Learn your own inner world.

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Learn to get to this place
that I call the inner observer.

00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:20.640 align:middle line:84%
It's where you-- the way
you'll know it is you

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.830 align:middle line:90%
will know your thoughts.

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:24.030 align:middle line:90%
You will know your emotions.

00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:25.710 align:middle line:84%
You will know your
bodily sensations.

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:27.180 align:middle line:90%
But they're not a part of you.

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:31.410 align:middle line:84%
You're able to observe them, but
you are not observing yourself.

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:32.580 align:middle line:90%
You can just observe.

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:34.380 align:middle line:84%
When you get to
this inner observer

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:37.420 align:middle line:84%
place, that's where you
can go, oh, this is mine.

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:38.410 align:middle line:90%
That's mine.

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:39.540 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's not mine.

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:40.500 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:41.542 align:middle line:90%
Very important right now.

00:46:41.542 --> 00:46:42.342 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Right.

00:46:42.342 --> 00:46:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And it comes down--
the way you get there

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:45.690 align:middle line:90%
is feel what you're feeling.

00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:46.950 align:middle line:90%
You feel your emotions.

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:48.900 align:middle line:90%
You recognize your thoughts.

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:50.417 align:middle line:84%
And this works
great if you're one

00:46:50.417 --> 00:46:52.500 align:middle line:84%
of those people that
overthink and think too much,

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:53.130 align:middle line:90%
and think, think.

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Because you can be aware
of all of those thoughts

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.793 align:middle line:84%
and just look at it,
look at it, look at it.

00:46:56.793 --> 00:46:59.550 align:middle line:10%
And then that moves you to
this central part of your being

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:01.500 align:middle line:10%
where you go, OK,
I can see my head

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.020 align:middle line:10%
going with all those thoughts,
and I can feel these emotions

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:04.820 align:middle line:10%
about it.

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:05.910 align:middle line:90%
And I'm feeling the chair.

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:07.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling the floor.

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:09.780 align:middle line:90%
But I'm observing these things.

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And like, oh, what is
that energy pattern moving

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:13.320 align:middle line:90%
through the room?

00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:13.990 align:middle line:90%
That was sudden--

00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:15.360 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Becoming the observer.

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.235 align:middle line:84%
OLSEN: And you'll feel
that whisper coming in

00:47:17.235 --> 00:47:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and you're like,
that wasn't mine.

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:19.860 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:22.417 align:middle line:84%
Very important, because right
now a lot of it's not ours, OK?

00:47:22.417 --> 00:47:23.250 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: That's right.

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:24.833 align:middle line:84%
REGINA: And just for
people that don't

00:47:24.833 --> 00:47:27.720 align:middle line:84%
know what egregore and tulpa
is, these are thought forms

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:30.810 align:middle line:84%
generated by enough people that
they become their own entity

00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:32.340 align:middle line:90%
in essence, right?

00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
validation you talked about,

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.790 align:middle line:84%
just to recap,
listening to ourselves,

00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:42.330 align:middle line:84%
watching these coincidences,
don't dismiss them.

00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:44.280 align:middle line:90%
They're not coincidences per se.

00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.500 align:middle line:10%
All of this self-validation.

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:48.130 align:middle line:10%
I love everything
you had to say,

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:51.310 align:middle line:10%
and I would love to
see one of your seances

00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:53.100 align:middle line:10%
one day where
everybody's having at it.

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:54.010 align:middle line:90%
That sounds fun.

00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:54.810 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Got one coming up
here real soon.

00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:56.640 align:middle line:90%
REGINA: All right.

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:57.060 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:57.860 align:middle line:90%
Good going.

00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, Kaedrich,
for coming back with me.

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:01.140 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:01.410 align:middle line:90%
OLSEN: Awesome.

00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:03.960 align:middle line:90%
