00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
We're here in the middle

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.940 align:middle line:84%
of Hyde Park on a sunny
Saturday afternoon.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.930 align:middle line:10%
About five years ago, my husband
and I were in the same spot,

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.360 align:middle line:10%
looked up to the sky, and
saw several silver orbs

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.500 align:middle line:10%
that seemed to be darting
around and blinking in and out.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.000 align:middle line:84%
I always wondered
what they were.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, toward that
end, we're going

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.880 align:middle line:84%
to be meeting with Malcolm
Robinson, a Scottish UFO

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.530 align:middle line:84%
researcher, and he's going to
be telling us some Scottish UFO

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.770 align:middle line:90%
and ghost stories.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.249 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:33.249 --> 00:00:53.149 align:middle line:90%


00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:54.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's good to have you here.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And you have so-- you
love to tell stories.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.760 align:middle line:90%
You tell them beautifully.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And you have been researching
the subject of UFOs, ghosts,

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and so forth for how
many decades now?

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.265 align:middle line:84%
>>MALCOLM ROBINSON: Over
30-- 40 years now, Regina.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:07.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes, a long, long time.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.263 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:08.263 --> 00:01:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say
I love your accent.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Everybody loves a
good Scottish accent.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And so as we go
along, if there are

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.724 align:middle line:84%
a couple of words that I think
our viewers may not understand,

00:01:17.724 --> 00:01:19.390 align:middle line:84%
I'll just repeat after
you, but it's not

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.530 align:middle line:90%
because I'm not hearing you.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.155 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: OK.

00:01:21.155 --> 00:01:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.120 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
well, let's just

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.440 align:middle line:84%
launch into how you
originally became

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.810 align:middle line:90%
fascinated with UFO phenomena.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yes.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.590 align:middle line:84%
I've always been fascinated
by strange phenomena.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.550 align:middle line:10%
Ever since I was a small
boy growing up in Scotland,

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.920 align:middle line:10%
I had this deep
desire to find out

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.940 align:middle line:10%
what was going on with these
ghosts and poltergeists and UFO

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.347 align:middle line:10%
sightings.

00:01:41.347 --> 00:01:42.930 align:middle line:10%
It's fair to say
that I was very, very

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:10%
skeptical of all these reports.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.890 align:middle line:84%
I thought there
will be no validity

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.010 align:middle line:90%
in these claims at all.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.510 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Who sees ghosts?

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.410 align:middle line:90%
Who sees UFOs?

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's like
anything else in life.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.026 align:middle line:84%
Once you go through your life
investigating these claims--

00:01:57.026 --> 00:01:58.150 align:middle line:90%
there is a lot of nonsense.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.250 align:middle line:84%
That is a lot of
shenanigans out there.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.280 align:middle line:84%
But I soon found that there
is no smoke without fire.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.430 align:middle line:84%
I've been slapped on
the face by a ghost.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.639 align:middle line:84%
I've had my hair
pulled by a ghost.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:13.380 align:middle line:84%
I've seen some magical things in
the sky and in haunted houses.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens to
you on a personal level,

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.730 align:middle line:84%
you come off the
skeptical fence.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.050 align:middle line:90%
The evidence is overwhelming.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was back in 1979 that
I formed my own society--

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Strange Phenomena
Investigations-- to purposely

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.580 align:middle line:84%
look and to try and come
up with some answers

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.630 align:middle line:84%
to account what at
present eludes us.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's a journey
that I've been

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.931 align:middle line:84%
fascinated with for
many, many years.

00:02:37.931 --> 00:02:39.180 align:middle line:90%
And I'm still on that journey.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.763 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:39.763 --> 00:02:43.060 align:middle line:10%
And you create reports so that
people who have had experiences

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.090 align:middle line:10%
have some kind of
common way that they're

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.590 align:middle line:10%
reporting the data to you.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.290 align:middle line:90%
It allows for drawings.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.120 align:middle line:90%
It allows for personal comments.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.130 align:middle line:84%
So you can standardize
your approach

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.812 align:middle line:84%
to doing your research
on these cases.

00:02:56.812 --> 00:02:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Absolutely.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle line:84%
With any case we
look at, there's

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.610 align:middle line:84%
always a questionnaire form
that we submit to the witnesses

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.170 align:middle line:84%
purely for them to write
down the height of a UFO

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.360 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, any noise,
any colors-- what

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.530 align:middle line:90%
did you experience?

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.830 align:middle line:90%
Did you hear anything?

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.450 align:middle line:90%
Could you draw it for us?

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And that helps us
build up a picture

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.490 align:middle line:90%
of what the witness saw.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.520 align:middle line:84%
We also have to
check with the police

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.730 align:middle line:84%
to see if any local people
had reported these sightings.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.780 align:middle line:84%
We have to check with
the local airports

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.815 align:middle line:84%
and the national airports
to see if any objects were

00:03:28.815 --> 00:03:31.260 align:middle line:90%
in the sky at that given time.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.400 align:middle line:84%
We check with local flying
clubs, helicopters, et cetera.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Effectively, we're
trying to just dot the Is

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and cross the Ts and find a
rational explanation to account

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.057 align:middle line:90%
for these given sightings.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Are you comfortable launching
in now to some cases?

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Because you have a lot
of cases, and we only

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.164 align:middle line:90%
have an hour to speak.

00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yes.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:52.371 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:52.371 --> 00:03:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
Livingston UFO incidents.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: This was
the case-- the one case,

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Regina-- that propelled
me into this domain.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.250 align:middle line:84%
It happened in
1979, in November,

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.090 align:middle line:84%
to a forestry worker
entitled Robert Taylor.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A forestry worker?

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.795 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:04:07.795 --> 00:04:08.336 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:08.336 --> 00:04:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: He was employed
by the Livingston Development

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.230 align:middle line:90%
Corporation Forestry Department.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.269 align:middle line:84%
And it was his job to ensure
that no cattle or sheep strayed

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.110 align:middle line:90%
into the woods and got lost.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.905 align:middle line:84%
It was a very mundane
job, but he loved it.

00:04:20.905 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:90%
He loved it.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.290 align:middle line:90%
All that changed.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Because on the
morning of November

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.700 align:middle line:84%
the 9th, 1979, as Robert Taylor
went into Dechmont Woods,

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.250 align:middle line:84%
his whole world was
catapulted upside down.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.350 align:middle line:84%
It was changed into
"The Twilight Zone."

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.590 align:middle line:84%
He got out of his truck and
he walked along this forestry

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.360 align:middle line:90%
path, as was his daily job.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:84%
He came upon a
clearing in the woods.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.740 align:middle line:90%
And he was absolutely amazed.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.380 align:middle line:84%
He was amazed because floating
about 20 feet above the surface

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.020 align:middle line:84%
of the grass in this
clearing-- in this wood--

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.210 align:middle line:84%
was this large,
dome-shaped object.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And it had a flange going
around its perimeter.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And coming up from
this flange was

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.380 align:middle line:90%
these cross-like projections.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.630 align:middle line:90%
He's standing looking at this.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.810 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't believe it.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.780 align:middle line:84%
He's never seen anything
like it in his--

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.528 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine how
shocking it would be.

00:05:10.528 --> 00:05:11.794 align:middle line:90%
And this was in '79, right?

00:05:11.794 --> 00:05:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: '79.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: On that journey--
he had his Irish red setter

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.850 align:middle line:84%
dog, Lara, to accompany
him on that journey.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And parts of this
object disappeared.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And you could see the young
trees in the background.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.140 align:middle line:90%
And then it would solidify.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.473 align:middle line:90%
And then it would dematerialize.

00:05:26.473 --> 00:05:28.049 align:middle line:84%
And then it would
solidify again.

00:05:28.049 --> 00:05:28.840 align:middle line:90%
And he's terrified.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.714 align:middle line:90%
He's looking at this.

00:05:29.714 --> 00:05:31.320 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't believe
what he's seeing.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And his dog is barking
furiously around him,

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.210 align:middle line:90%
running around in circles.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, what
resembled two Second World War

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.440 align:middle line:90%
sea mines.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sea what?

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: Sea
mines-- the mines

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.610 align:middle line:84%
that you got in the North
Atlantic, and the shipping,

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.499 align:middle line:84%
to-- it was these prods sticking
up from a spherical ball.

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: And it
was similar to that.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Two spherical balls
dropped down from

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.740 align:middle line:84%
beneath this hovering
object and rested

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.700 align:middle line:84%
on the grass-- started rolling
across the grass towards him.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.860 align:middle line:90%
They stopped.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.220 align:middle line:84%
Then they projected these
rod-like projections

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.390 align:middle line:84%
towards both of
his hips and pulled

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.660 align:middle line:84%
them-- pulled them
very, very forcibly

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.710 align:middle line:90%
towards this bigger object.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, he
smelled a horrible burning

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.900 align:middle line:84%
smell pervading the whole area--
this horrible, tangent burning

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.550 align:middle line:90%
smell.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And then it was like
a swish of a cane--

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.590 align:middle line:90%
just swish-- moving around.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.370 align:middle line:90%
And he lost consciousness.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.060 align:middle line:84%
When he regained
consciousness, Regina,

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.310 align:middle line:84%
he found that his
clothes were torn.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'll show you
these in a moment.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:34.393 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:37.100 align:middle line:84%
We have the pants he was
wearing when he was on duty.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: These are the
pants that he was wearing.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.778 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
said on each hip?

00:06:39.778 --> 00:06:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Absolutely.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.270 align:middle line:84%
This rip here differs slightly
from the rip on the right hand

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.150 align:middle line:90%
side.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.630 align:middle line:90%
This is more elongated.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.590 align:middle line:10%
And he was pulled up forcibly--
lifted up into the air

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.230 align:middle line:10%
and thrown down on the ground.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:90%
And he had a terrible thirst.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.910 align:middle line:90%
He had a pounding headache.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And he staggered back
to his pickup truck.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.840 align:middle line:84%
But just before he
did do so, he saw

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.450 align:middle line:84%
these marks in the
grass-- triangular

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.755 align:middle line:84%
and circular marks--
depressions in the grass

00:07:05.755 --> 00:07:08.510 align:middle line:90%
that previously were not there.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.024 align:middle line:84%
He tried to radio in his
pickup truck to his base,

00:07:12.024 --> 00:07:12.690 align:middle line:90%
but he couldn't.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.020 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't speak.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And he reversed the
truck into a ditch,

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.700 align:middle line:84%
so he couldn't
get the truck out.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.130 align:middle line:84%
He staggered home to his home
in a small village called Deans.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And his wife, when
she saw him, she

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.185 align:middle line:90%
went, what's happened to you?

00:07:26.185 --> 00:07:27.420 align:middle line:90%
His trousers are torn.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.340 align:middle line:90%
His clothes are all dirty.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And his famous words
were, I've been attacked.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.490 align:middle line:90%
You've been attacked?

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.120 align:middle line:90%
Attacked by what?

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And he said the immortal
worlds, which he could only say

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.900 align:middle line:90%
was a spaceship.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, she phoned his
boss-- a gentleman

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.500 align:middle line:84%
by the name of
Malcolm Drummond-- who

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.320 align:middle line:90%
came down to speak to Robert.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.240 align:middle line:84%
The police became
involved because it

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.990 align:middle line:84%
was an assault by person
or persons unknown.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:57.450 align:middle line:84%
The police visited
the area in question.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.145 align:middle line:90%
They saw the marks in the grass.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.645 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, are
these the marks--

00:08:00.645 --> 00:08:03.790 align:middle line:84%
I saw some pictures of
yours off camera-- the marks

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.790 align:middle line:84%
that you showed in the
grass of the photographs?

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.248 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: That's
correct, Regina.

00:08:07.248 --> 00:08:10.140 align:middle line:84%
The police saw these marks
in the grass themselves.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And they fenced off
the area and did not

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.900 align:middle line:84%
allow any local people
to come and contaminate

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.480 align:middle line:84%
that site because that
was a crime scene--

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.750 align:middle line:84%
one of the first crime
scenes in the United Kingdom

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.440 align:middle line:90%
to do with UFOs.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.320 align:middle line:90%
I visited Robert Taylor.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.070 align:middle line:90%
I interviewed him.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.510 align:middle line:90%
He's a very genuine passion.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.220 align:middle line:90%
He does not believe in UFOs.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.500 align:middle line:84%
That's the furthest
thing away from his mind.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.299 align:middle line:84%
But he says,
Malcolm, I saw that.

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:39.909 align:middle line:90%
I saw that craft.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, I will always
say that I saw that craft.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.630 align:middle line:90%
It was unbelievable.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And I believe in the
honesty of that gentleman.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of
the biggest cases--

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:57.520 align:middle line:84%
in fact, the forensic people at
Bathgate police station looked

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.510 align:middle line:90%
at the trousers.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And they analyzed these
trousers us and they said,

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.480 align:middle line:84%
the rips on these
trousers were not

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.824 align:middle line:84%
made by any sharp forrest
debris like forest

00:09:08.824 --> 00:09:09.740 align:middle line:90%
twigs or sharp stones.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.550 align:middle line:84%
It would be more raggedy
or something, wouldn't it?

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.258 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:09:12.258 --> 00:09:14.290 align:middle line:84%
So the police
forensic gentleman--

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:17.030 align:middle line:84%
a chap called Lester Knibb--
says, these trousers were,

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:20.490 align:middle line:84%
indeed, pulled forcibly
upwards in the manner

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.530 align:middle line:90%
suggested by the witness.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, that case
stands the test of time.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.784 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of Scotland's
most baffling mysteries.

00:09:28.784 --> 00:09:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At the
time, did they do

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.130 align:middle line:84%
any kind of readings off of
the burn marks-- radiation

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:34.910 align:middle line:90%
or any of that?

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.780 align:middle line:90%
And what did they find?

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: Sadly, that
wasn't conducted at the time.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was just a young Ufologist
learning my trade, so to speak,

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.060 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have the
equipment to do that myself.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.430 align:middle line:84%
But he had these
scars on his body.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.019 align:middle line:90%
He had strange dreams.

00:09:51.019 --> 00:09:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
let's talk about some

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.220 align:middle line:84%
of that, because that's
usually-- the part that they

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.360 align:middle line:84%
can't remember is often
indicated in those things.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yes.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Some months later, Robert
Taylor telephoned my house.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And he says that he'd been
having these strange dreams

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.940 align:middle line:84%
of these gray shapes
coming into his dream

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.680 align:middle line:90%
world-- this gray face.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And it only lasted
on a couple of nights

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.500 align:middle line:90%
and he never had that again.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And it does make
me wonder if what

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:22.120 align:middle line:84%
he saw was truly part and
parcel of a alien abduction--

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.210 align:middle line:90%
call it what you will.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.780 align:middle line:90%
And I think he did have that.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So after those
prods came out to the hips,

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:35.390 align:middle line:84%
where the trousers are torn,
and pulled him toward them,

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.394 align:middle line:90%
was it blank after that?

00:10:37.394 --> 00:10:38.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yes.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.230 align:middle line:90%
He lost consciousness.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.760 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how long
he lost consciousness.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.960 align:middle line:90%
It may have been a minute.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.590 align:middle line:84%
It may have been
several minutes.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.835 align:middle line:84%
But to this day, we don't
know how long that was.

00:10:46.835 --> 00:10:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
kind of marks did he

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.160 align:middle line:84%
have on this body
after all this?

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.350 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: Small
scratch marks just where

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.300 align:middle line:84%
they had-- on the
trousers-- on the pants.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Just small scratch
marks on his thighs,

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.380 align:middle line:84%
which corresponded with the
pulling up of his person.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:00.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts
on Robert Taylor

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:07.857 align:middle line:84%
before we move on
to the A70 incident?

00:11:07.857 --> 00:11:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: Well,
I'd just like to say

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.720 align:middle line:90%
that's it is a fascinating case.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.180 align:middle line:84%
It's one of Scotland's
biggest cases.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And people must
recognize the fact

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.490 align:middle line:84%
that we're not just dealing
here with lights in the sky.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people encounter weird
objects right up close-- right

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.710 align:middle line:90%
in your face.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And on the eventful morning
of November the 9th, 1979,

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Robert Taylor did encounter
something very weird.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:33.520 align:middle line:90%
He didn't want it to happen.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.060 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want it to
happen, but it did.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's just part and
parcel of a jigsaw--

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.750 align:middle line:84%
of a big, ufological jigsaw
from pieces from America,

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.690 align:middle line:90%
from Canada, Venezuela.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:48.390 align:middle line:84%
It sits tight together, but
where it leads us, who knows?

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and that was
around the period of time

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.910 align:middle line:84%
as-- I think it was only
a couple years later where

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:55.030 align:middle line:84%
you had Rendlesham Forest
and Bentwaters, right?

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yes.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:55.641 align:middle line:90%
Correct, yes.

00:11:55.641 --> 00:11:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there was a lot of
activity, again, in the forest.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:03.930 align:middle line:84%
So they were coming into
these non populated areas,

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:05.070 align:middle line:90%
for whatever purpose.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:07.660 align:middle line:10%
And again, there
was the same dynamic

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.500 align:middle line:10%
of having that
imprint in the ground,

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.780 align:middle line:10%
although they did take radiation
level readings at that time,

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.650 align:middle line:10%
at Rendlesham and
Bentwaters, right?

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:15.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: They did, yes.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:16.382 align:middle line:90%
Very much so.

00:12:16.382 --> 00:12:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But a very similar
phenomenon except no one

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:19.965 align:middle line:84%
was pulled forward
by their hips.

00:12:19.965 --> 00:12:21.215 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yeah, that's true.

00:12:21.215 --> 00:12:22.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know Larry
Warren, who was

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:26.340 align:middle line:84%
part involved in the Rendlesham
Forest case, very, very well.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.440 align:middle line:90%
Lovely fellow.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, he still
maintains that yeah, he

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.630 align:middle line:84%
saw that craft in
Rendlesham Forest, as well.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:35.300 align:middle line:84%
It was different from what
Robert Taylor saw, admittedly.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.320 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's
another strong case--

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The point
is, it was all

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.860 align:middle line:84%
happening in the
forests around the UK,

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.050 align:middle line:84%
in this saturated
period of time--

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:43.884 align:middle line:90%
late '70s and early '80s.

00:12:43.884 --> 00:12:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yes.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.720 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:44.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:45.431 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:48.522 align:middle line:84%
Let's go on to
the A70 abduction.

00:12:48.522 --> 00:12:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.380 align:middle line:84%
This is another fascinating
case in the annals

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:52.625 align:middle line:90%
of Scottish ufology.

00:12:52.625 --> 00:12:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of
these weird cases.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, we all know about
yet UFO abductions.

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.500 align:middle line:84%
But I personally-- at
that time in my life, back

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.590 align:middle line:84%
in the early 1990s, although
I was aware of these cases,

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.370 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't researched any.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until these
two gentlemen came to me

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.050 align:middle line:84%
and told me this fascinating
tale that I went,

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.460 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.380 align:middle line:90%
This is weird.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.500 align:middle line:90%
This is weird.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:21.350 align:middle line:84%
What happened was that on an
August evening back in 1992,

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Gary Wood and Colin
Wright was traveling

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.150 align:middle line:90%
in a car from Edinburgh.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.450 align:middle line:84%
They left the built
up city of Edinburgh.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And their destination
was a small village

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.990 align:middle line:90%
called Tarbrax in West Lothian.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And as the car left Edinburgh
and went out to countryside--

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:42.320 align:middle line:84%
it was fields on either side--
a small house there, et cetera.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.470 align:middle line:90%
And it was late at night.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And they're traveling
down the road.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.340 align:middle line:84%
They had no interest
in UFOs, Regina.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.170 align:middle line:84%
They'd heard about it
like everybody else,

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:52.280 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't a
fascination for them.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So they're driving
down this road.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, Collin
says, Gary, what's that?

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And they peered through
the windshield of the car

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.335 align:middle line:84%
and they saw this disc shaped
object hovering about 20,

00:14:05.335 --> 00:14:07.820 align:middle line:84%
30 feet above the
surface of the road.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And they knew-- they knew right
away, this wasn't a helicopter.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.379 align:middle line:84%
This wasn't an aircraft of
any way, shape, or form.

00:14:14.379 --> 00:14:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it
was hovering, so--

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.295 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: It
was hovering, yes.

00:14:17.295 --> 00:14:17.899 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:19.565 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: And rather
than stop the car

00:14:19.565 --> 00:14:23.640 align:middle line:84%
and go back, they decided
that the best course of action

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.000 align:middle line:84%
would be just to travel
underneath this object

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.800 align:middle line:90%
and just get away.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So if you can imagine
my hand as the UFO

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and this is the car--
as the car was traveling

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:36.800 align:middle line:84%
underneath this
object, it emitted

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.860 align:middle line:84%
a big, heavy, silver,
shimmering curtain of light--

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:46.240 align:middle line:84%
descended like sparkling
snowflakes and hit the car.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as that
effect hit the car,

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:53.462 align:middle line:84%
both men were enveloped in
total and inky blackness.

00:14:53.462 --> 00:14:54.670 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't see each other.

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.830 align:middle line:84%
They could see the
dashboard of the car.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.040 align:middle line:90%
Where are we?

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.251 align:middle line:90%
What's happened?

00:14:59.251 --> 00:14:59.750 align:middle line:90%
Bang.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Within seconds, they
regained their sight.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.830 align:middle line:84%
The car was shuddering very,
very violently in the road.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.900 align:middle line:84%
They had to control the
car from going into a bank.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, they just
went off to their destination.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:13.350 align:middle line:84%
They knocked on
the occupant's door

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:15.810 align:middle line:84%
who they were going to
see in this small village.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And the lady says,
where have you been?

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:19.577 align:middle line:90%
You're an hour and a half late.

00:15:19.577 --> 00:15:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And they rushed into
the home and they says,

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:24.430 align:middle line:84%
you'll never believe
what we have seen.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And they proceeded to tell the
occupants of this family home

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:32.780 align:middle line:84%
about this strange
craft in the sky.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.660 align:middle line:84%
That night and subsequent
nights thereafter, they

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.960 align:middle line:84%
had these horrible dreams of
these small, gray creatures

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.090 align:middle line:90%
coming into their dream world.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:44.230 align:middle line:84%
They found scoop marks
on their body-- scars

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.942 align:middle line:84%
on their body that
previously were not there.

00:15:46.942 --> 00:15:47.900 align:middle line:90%
We all know our bodies.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.240 align:middle line:90%
We take showers, et cetera.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:49.880 align:middle line:90%
We know--

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were they little
scratches or cuts or pinpricks

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:53.930 align:middle line:90%
or what was the nature of them?

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: These were
semicircular marks.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.960 align:middle line:84%
They weren't cuts, but they
were deep indentations.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.340 align:middle line:90%
They were quite formulated.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.510 align:middle line:90%
They broke the skin.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And they said to
themselves, surely,

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.750 align:middle line:84%
this can't be one of
those crazy UFO stories.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:13.830 align:middle line:90%
But what if it is?

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:15.510 align:middle line:90%
Who do we turn to?

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.140 align:middle line:84%
So they went to
their local library.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.535 align:middle line:84%
They picked up a
book on UFOs, which

00:16:19.535 --> 00:16:23.270 align:middle line:84%
had my organization in
the back of the book.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:24.710 align:middle line:90%
And they contacted me.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And I quickly invited them to my
home, sat both gentlemen down.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.120 align:middle line:84%
I says, guys, just
tell it as it is.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.110 align:middle line:84%
They proceeded to
tell me this story.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, Regina,
I advocated the use

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:41.750 align:middle line:84%
of hypnotic regression as
a tool to perhaps unlock

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:46.690 align:middle line:84%
the hidden subconscious
memories, et cetera.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And I says to these
two gentlemen,

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.450 align:middle line:90%
would you like me to do this?

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Would you like hypnosis
used on you just

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.420 align:middle line:84%
to see if perhaps something
else happened that night?

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.570 align:middle line:84%
It may not have, but
would you like to see?

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.970 align:middle line:90%
Malcolm, we'll try anything.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.650 align:middle line:84%
We need to know what happened
because even our wives don't

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:05.250 align:middle line:90%
believe us.

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.210 align:middle line:84%
So we used a qualify
hypnotherapist.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:13.150 align:middle line:84%
We independently subjected
both men to hypnotic regression

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:17.310 align:middle line:84%
and took them back to
that August evening.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, under hypnosis, a
typical abduction scenario

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.940 align:middle line:84%
unfolded-- very, very similar
to European and worldwide

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.700 align:middle line:90%
abduction cases.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.635 align:middle line:84%
What I'm about to say
just now to yourself

00:17:29.635 --> 00:17:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and your lovely viewers
is as the car hit

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:36.580 align:middle line:84%
this shimmering light,
they were forcibly

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:41.550 align:middle line:84%
taken out of this vehicle
by several small creatures--

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:43.830 align:middle line:84%
we call them the
Grays-- roughly 3

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:46.910 align:middle line:84%
and a half to 4 feet
tall; pear-shaped heads;

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:50.640 align:middle line:84%
black, inky, almond-shaped
eyes; no sign of any genitalia;

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.410 align:middle line:90%
very translucent creatures.

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And they were transported
to this object.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:00.980 align:middle line:84%
They were taken independently
to different rooms.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.730 align:middle line:90%
They were stripped naked.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.615 align:middle line:84%
And they were
subjected to some form

00:18:04.615 --> 00:18:07.810 align:middle line:84%
of medical or
clinical examination.

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's artwork that's
associated with this, right?

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:11.617 align:middle line:90%
The man lying on the table?

00:18:11.617 --> 00:18:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yes, that's correct.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is that Collin?

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: That's
Gary-- Gary Wood.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's Gary?

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:16.800 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's go ahead and talk
about what they experienced.

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.990 align:middle line:84%
It's really well done
artwork, by the way.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: Thankfully, we
have illustrations-- drawings

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:26.880 align:middle line:84%
made by both Gary Wood
and Collin Wright.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.210 align:middle line:84%
But some of recall
under hypnosis

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.860 align:middle line:84%
was Gary found himself on
this flat, raised table.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.110 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't move.

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:35.200 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't turn his head.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.890 align:middle line:90%
He could only move his eyes.

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And moving around this bed were
these small, gray creatures.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were
small, but he did

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.370 align:middle line:84%
observe have some
of these creatures

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.486 align:middle line:90%
were about 6 to 7 feet tall.

00:18:46.486 --> 00:18:48.110 align:middle line:84%
So there were small
ones and tall ones.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were they also
a little bit paler than--

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: They were.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is the
same story over and over.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.140 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:52.765 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:52.765 --> 00:18:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: They were.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:56.875 align:middle line:84%
And he desperately wanted
to hit-- being Scottish,

00:18:56.875 --> 00:18:58.070 align:middle line:90%
he couldn't do that.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.864 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:58.864 --> 00:18:59.660 align:middle line:90%
Start a brawl.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: He wanted to
brawl with these little guys.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.660 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
he couldn't move.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.390 align:middle line:90%
And he was really traumatized.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:08.700 align:middle line:84%
He very frightened, as I'm
sure your viewers would

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.570 align:middle line:90%
be in that environment.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:13.020 align:middle line:10%
And they preceded to move
this pendulum device up

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.450 align:middle line:10%
and down his body for
reasons-- don't know.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:18.370 align:middle line:10%
And then suddenly,
this can-- this

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:22.880 align:middle line:10%
can shaped device, about
so high-- about 2 and 1/2

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.085 align:middle line:10%
feet-- rose up.

00:19:24.085 --> 00:19:26.210 align:middle line:84%
He could see it just out
of the corner of his eye--

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.940 align:middle line:84%
rose up from the
floor to head height

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.410 align:middle line:84%
and started spinning
around, making a noise.

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.570 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't know what it was.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And then as he
looked to the left,

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:40.420 align:middle line:84%
just out of the side of his
eye, he saw a naked female.

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:44.840 align:middle line:84%
She was sitting on the floor
of this room with her knees

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.690 align:middle line:84%
under her chin, with her arms
wrapped around her knees.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.270 align:middle line:84%
She had shaggy,
loose, permed hair.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And she gently turned
her head around

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.190 align:middle line:84%
to look at Gary, who
was lying behind her,

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:57.580 align:middle line:84%
and tears were
running down her face.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And Gary says,
Malcolm, I'll always

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.957 align:middle line:84%
remember how sad
and forlorn that--

00:20:02.957 --> 00:20:05.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we have that
depiction of her from behind,

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:06.750 align:middle line:90%
sitting on the floor of the UFO.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:07.400 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: We have.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:09.393 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: And he
says, Malcolm, I'll

00:20:09.393 --> 00:20:11.760 align:middle line:84%
always remember
how sad she looked.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And Collin, the other
witness, found himself

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.635 align:middle line:84%
in a curved chair, of which
we have drawings of, which

00:20:17.635 --> 00:20:19.030 align:middle line:90%
we'll see.

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.980 align:middle line:10%
And at another
point, Collin also

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:26.410 align:middle line:10%
found himself encased then
in this tall glass or perspex

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:27.360 align:middle line:10%
chamber.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:32.140 align:middle line:10%
It was like a man's cigar tube,
but only about 8, 9 feet tall,

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:32.977 align:middle line:10%
made of glass.

00:20:32.977 --> 00:20:33.810 align:middle line:10%
And he was strapped.

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:34.510 align:middle line:10%
He was naked.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:37.440 align:middle line:10%
He was strapped in this
thing and he couldn't move.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.760 align:middle line:84%
But what he could
see around about him

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:44.206 align:middle line:84%
was a number of other perspex
chambers with other naked males

00:20:44.206 --> 00:20:45.530 align:middle line:90%
and females there.

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:48.475 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
mist-- columns of mist

00:20:48.475 --> 00:20:51.350 align:middle line:84%
were pervading around all
these columns-- these glass

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.170 align:middle line:90%
or perspex chambers.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:54.610 align:middle line:90%
And he was very frightened.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:56.710 align:middle line:90%
He was very frightened.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:01.330 align:middle line:84%
He also remembers lying
on this curved chair where

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:03.490 align:middle line:84%
this device came
down from the ceiling

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:06.310 align:middle line:84%
and a needle-like device
penetrated his eye.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:11.160 align:middle line:84%
So it had all the hallmarks
of other abductions,

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.640 align:middle line:90%
apart from one strange aspect.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Some of these small,
gray creatures had

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:19.280 align:middle line:84%
red, yellow, and
green perforations

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.394 align:middle line:84%
underneath their
eyes, just like a--

00:21:21.394 --> 00:21:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Until we
talked, I hadn't ever

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.019 align:middle line:90%
heard that part before.

00:21:24.019 --> 00:21:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: It's bizarre.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Red, yellow, and
green little lines, right?

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Little lines, yes.

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:28.970 align:middle line:90%
Very bizarre.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
said perforations?

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: If you like.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.889 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's like a fish's
gills-- this slit on a--

00:21:33.889 --> 00:21:34.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.510 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: It was like little
slits, but they were colored.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:41.732 align:middle line:84%
And some of these creatures
had the pear-shaped heads

00:21:41.732 --> 00:21:43.190 align:middle line:84%
whilst other of
these creatures had

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:46.350 align:middle line:84%
an indentation at the top of
their heads, which is again,

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:51.620 align:middle line:84%
very strange and not in keeping
with worldwide UFO events.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm only hoping that
some of your viewers

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.540 align:middle line:84%
may have their own case or know
of something with these green,

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.120 align:middle line:90%
yellow, and red perforations.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:90%
Cause it all adds up.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
hopefully, they'll

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:04.200 align:middle line:84%
let us know--
right in after this

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.660 align:middle line:90%
if they've seen that before.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And see if this is classic to
experiences all over the world,

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:10.960 align:middle line:90%
in terms of abductions.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.126 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yes, absolutely.

00:22:12.126 --> 00:22:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so did
they ever remember or get

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.050 align:middle line:84%
a sense of why they were
there, after they went

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:20.770 align:middle line:90%
through the hypnotic regression?

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: Gary was getting
strange words formulating

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:24.670 align:middle line:90%
in his head.

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:27.680 align:middle line:84%
He knew that they
were not his words.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, this word
formulated-- "sanctuary."

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.824 align:middle line:84%
That's what he heard very,
very clearly in a metallic--

00:22:33.824 --> 00:22:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.240 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.380 align:middle line:84%
This metallic
voice-- "sanctuary."

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.030 align:middle line:90%
Because Gary was asking, why?

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:43.150 align:middle line:90%
What is it you want?

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:44.915 align:middle line:90%
Why are you doing this to me?

00:22:44.915 --> 00:22:47.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm just a normal chap.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.310 align:middle line:90%
And he got "sanctuary."

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:53.049 align:middle line:84%
And why that word-- we
know what it means, but--

00:22:53.049 --> 00:22:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:57.604 align:middle line:84%
Now, after this-- I mean,
it was shocking event.

00:22:57.604 --> 00:22:58.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yes.

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Once they recalled
all this, as the years went on,

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:05.270 align:middle line:84%
did anything change in terms
of the nature of their lives,

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:08.460 align:middle line:84%
the quality of their lives,
their dreams-- anything

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:09.494 align:middle line:90%
like this?

00:23:09.494 --> 00:23:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: Well, there was
one occasion a few years

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.470 align:middle line:90%
after that, Regina.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:17.295 align:middle line:84%
Gary was in a car in Edinburgh
with his two young sons--

00:23:17.295 --> 00:23:19.450 align:middle line:84%
the built-up city of
Edinburghugh-- a big city.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly-- and
during the daytime-- suddenly,

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:26.980 align:middle line:84%
the whole car was enveloped
and a white cardboard

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.156 align:middle line:84%
went right round the
car-- like a white mist

00:23:29.156 --> 00:23:31.500 align:middle line:90%
or a-- right round the car.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And his young sons were
screaming, Dad, Dad,

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:34.000 align:middle line:90%
what's this?

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.040 align:middle line:90%
What's this?

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.490 align:middle line:90%
And we don't know what happened.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:40.960 align:middle line:84%
There was no missing time there,
but that was a strange event.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Gary also said that
on one occasion,

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.721 align:middle line:84%
he saw one of these
creatures in his room.

00:23:46.721 --> 00:23:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The little
grays or the taller--

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: Little
grays in his room.

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: And on one occasion,
Gary's wife telephoned me.

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And she says, Malcolm, I'd
like to apologize to you.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:57.260 align:middle line:90%
And I says, why?

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:00.620 align:middle line:84%
She says, I'm never accepted
my husband's story on this.

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:03.190 align:middle line:84%
I thought he's making
it up, but not now.

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:04.340 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, last night, I
was sleeping with Gary

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.590 align:middle line:90%
in our bed in the family home.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:10.800 align:middle line:90%
Gary was sleeping.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.690 align:middle line:90%
I was reading a book.

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:15.650 align:middle line:84%
I closed the book, put the
book on the bedside table,

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:17.330 align:middle line:90%
switched off the light.

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And about a minute
later, my ankles

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:22.960 align:middle line:84%
were pulled very
forcibly down the bed.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And I looked and at
the foot of the bed

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.760 align:middle line:84%
were these small,
gray creatures,

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.150 align:middle line:90%
pulling at my ankles.

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And they just melted
back into the wall.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:33.800 align:middle line:90%
She says, Malcolm, I'm so sorry.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.410 align:middle line:90%
I believe my husband now.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:37.396 align:middle line:90%
And it does affect families.

00:24:37.396 --> 00:24:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
again in America, I

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:41.010 align:middle line:84%
interviewed a woman
named Andrea Perron,

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and her sisters had the same
experience in the house they

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.140 align:middle line:84%
lived in, which was
really quite a big story.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.684 align:middle line:10%
The movie "The Conjuring"
was loosely based on it.

00:24:49.684 --> 00:24:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yes.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then we also spoke
with Ann Andrews the other day,

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.660 align:middle line:84%
and what happened
with her sons--

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.110 align:middle line:84%
particularly Jason,
but also Daniel.

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And again, it doesn't matter
where in the world-- very,

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:04.959 align:middle line:84%
very similar descriptions of
the experience keep appearing.

00:25:04.959 --> 00:25:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: We're dealing
with a real phenomenon.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.249 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with something
that-- quite rightly, you

00:25:09.249 --> 00:25:11.900 align:middle line:84%
said-- is occurring
all over the world.

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.510 align:middle line:84%
As a researcher,
we have to find out

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:16.170 align:middle line:84%
if people are on medication,
if they're on drugs and just

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:18.290 align:middle line:84%
concocting false and
elaborate stories.

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:20.630 align:middle line:84%
We have to ensure that the
people we're dealing with

00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:22.210 align:middle line:90%
are telling the truth.

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:25.390 align:middle line:84%
95% of UFO reports
and abduction stories

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:29.700 align:middle line:84%
can easily be explained
as falsehoods, et cetera.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.870 align:middle line:84%
The 5% that remain, 3% could
be our own black budget

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:35.040 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.600 align:middle line:84%
The stealth aircraft
was flying in the States

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.809 align:middle line:84%
about 10 years before America
had said, that's ours.

00:25:40.809 --> 00:25:42.600 align:middle line:84%
It give rise to a lot
of false UFO reports.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.599 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
according to Mark McCandlish

00:25:44.599 --> 00:25:48.620 align:middle line:84%
and his experiences
at Area 51 and his--

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.970 align:middle line:84%
those are well known now--
the Mark McCandlish drawings

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:55.812 align:middle line:84%
strong of full blown spacecraft
that was hovering in the area.

00:25:55.812 --> 00:25:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Absolutely.

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:58.353 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
was many years ago.

00:25:58.353 --> 00:26:00.410 align:middle line:84%
So we know the
technology has existed.

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:03.580 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBINSON: And here,
at my time of life now,

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:07.100 align:middle line:10%
researching this for
over 35, 40 years,

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.960 align:middle line:10%
I honestly believe
that we're dealing

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.810 align:middle line:10%
with something real--
something tangible.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:12.080 align:middle line:90%
It's always been with us.

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.565 align:middle line:84%
We look at
Renaissance paintings,

00:26:13.565 --> 00:26:16.430 align:middle line:84%
it's in-- these craft,
have been there.

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And what annoys me
and what frustrates

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.650 align:middle line:90%
me is these UFO abductions.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:24.632 align:middle line:90%
Why, why, why, why?

00:26:24.632 --> 00:26:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Because they've been
abducting people now

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.070 align:middle line:90%
for many, many years.

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:30.675 align:middle line:10%
Some people would say it's
a genetic program-- they're

00:26:30.675 --> 00:26:32.730 align:middle line:10%
taking sperm and ova
from males and females

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:34.510 align:middle line:10%
to repopulate a dying planet.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:36.930 align:middle line:10%
Sounds "Star Trek."

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Female abductees have been
shown half human, half hybrid

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:40.960 align:middle line:90%
children.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And telepathically, it's been
said, that belongs to you.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:45.530 align:middle line:84%
That's part you
and it's part us.

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:47.470 align:middle line:90%
Nice stories-- fanciful stories.

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:49.425 align:middle line:84%
But it still annoys
me that, why are

00:26:49.425 --> 00:26:51.650 align:middle line:90%
we still getting this today?

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Is it because, perhaps,
planet Earth is a zoo?

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.130 align:middle line:90%
Did they actually seat us here?

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:57.130 align:middle line:90%
We can look at Darwin.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:58.220 align:middle line:90%
When can look at God.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:59.260 align:middle line:90%
We can look at Jesus.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:02.430 align:middle line:84%
We can look at the third
option of maybe we are a zoo.

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:03.660 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we are their children.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.080 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we are hybrids of them.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's only speculation.

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.142 align:middle line:90%
But it's a possibility.

00:27:10.142 --> 00:27:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean, when
you look at the morality of it

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.020 align:middle line:84%
and we think, oh,
how dare they, well,

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.540 align:middle line:84%
look what we do
to other species.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.920 align:middle line:84%
So again, if we are just
another species in their eyes--

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.250 align:middle line:84%
and you have to look at the
reality that it's not as though

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:27.050 align:middle line:84%
these people are
murdered and brutalized.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:30.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not as though our
world has been taken over

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:34.180 align:middle line:84%
and occupied by these
other supposed oppressors--

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.649 align:middle line:90%
the ones that abduct people.

00:27:35.649 --> 00:27:37.190 align:middle line:84%
We're still going
on about our lives.

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:39.480 align:middle line:84%
So I think maybe
your analogy of a zoo

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.372 align:middle line:84%
might not be-- it might not be
inappropriate, in certain ways.

00:27:43.372 --> 00:27:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.163 align:middle line:84%
And then obviously, we
have to look at, allegedly,

00:27:46.163 --> 00:27:47.360 align:middle line:90%
these other races.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not just the Grays.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.620 align:middle line:84%
We have these
lizard-type creatures

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.450 align:middle line:84%
which I don't speak
about, because I've not

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:53.851 align:middle line:90%
researched any of these cases.

00:27:53.851 --> 00:27:55.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm aware of them--
reptilians, et cetera,

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:59.030 align:middle line:84%
which David Icke
speaks about a lot.

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:01.260 align:middle line:84%
But what we have to
remember is whereas we're

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.470 align:middle line:84%
living in the age of DreamWorks
laboratory-- of Steven

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Spielberg's DreamWorks
laboratory--

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.110 align:middle line:84%
where anything can be
manipulated onto a computer

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:10.550 align:middle line:90%
to look the real deal.

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:12.910 align:middle line:84%
But, thankfully
the same technology

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:16.225 align:middle line:84%
can be applied to prove that
it's the real deal or not.

00:28:16.225 --> 00:28:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And again, the
thing that intrigues

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.834 align:middle line:84%
me is the people who
have been abducted

00:28:21.834 --> 00:28:23.500 align:middle line:84%
and those around them
who have witnessed

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.550 align:middle line:84%
is the feeling they
come away with.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Again, these common
experiences of paralysis.

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:30.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's not
accounted for if you're

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.150 align:middle line:84%
looking at back engineered
military technology,

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:33.650 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:35.620 align:middle line:84%
That has nothing to
do with, necessarily,

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.400 align:middle line:84%
the human consciousness
interface,

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.200 align:middle line:84%
as these kinds of
experiences do,

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.575 align:middle line:90%
which lends more credence to it.

00:28:40.575 --> 00:28:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: When we look
at back engineering,

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:44.710 align:middle line:84%
we may say that some of
the technology that's

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.290 align:middle line:84%
flying in our skies
today may have been--

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:50.430 align:middle line:84%
and it's a big may-- people may
differ in their investigations

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and analysis-- that
some of this was back

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.930 align:middle line:84%
engineering from
alien technology.

00:28:55.930 --> 00:29:01.280 align:middle line:84%
There is abductees who have
seen both the small grays

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.087 align:middle line:84%
and military people in the same
room-- in the same environment.

00:29:04.087 --> 00:29:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:04.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:07.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: And that leads
me to think, if that's true--

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and I do believe the testimony--
that these people are telling

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:15.750 align:middle line:84%
the truth-- then it would very
must seem to suggest that there

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.440 align:middle line:84%
are this collusion,
if you like--

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.850 align:middle line:90%
they are working side by side.

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:21.210 align:middle line:90%
And that may lend-- but why?

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:22.470 align:middle line:90%
Again, it opens up, why?

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.970 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:24.000 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not only that
you have been researching

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:28.280 align:middle line:84%
other people's experiences--
you've had some sightings

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.742 align:middle line:90%
and experiences of your own.

00:29:29.742 --> 00:29:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for a moment,

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.390 align:middle line:84%
because I think that's
a nice segue going

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:37.345 align:middle line:84%
into the story of ghosts,
because these are not separate,

00:29:37.345 --> 00:29:37.845 align:middle line:90%
necessarily.

00:29:37.845 --> 00:29:39.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yes.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, like I said
at the top there,

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:45.250 align:middle line:84%
this fascination for all things
weird and wonderful probably--

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.010 align:middle line:84%
one of the very
early events, Regina,

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:50.990 align:middle line:84%
happened when I was a young
boy, about 7, 8 years of age.

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:54.430 align:middle line:84%
I was playing football
in a local park.

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was a lovely summer's
day-- not a cloud in the sky.

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up and there's
this big, big silver

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.330 align:middle line:84%
ball-- this oval-shaped
ball was hovering up there.

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:03.580 align:middle line:90%
I went, what on Earth is that?

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:04.750 align:middle line:90%
And we all stopped.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Everybody stopped playing
football and looked at this.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, we
don't know what it was.

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.670 align:middle line:84%
We looked down and then we
looked up and it was gone.

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:13.670 align:middle line:90%
In an instant, it was gone.

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
another time at Loch Ness,

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.360 align:middle line:84%
because I do a lot of
research at Loch Ness.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.530 align:middle line:90%
I speak to witnesses, et cetera.

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And we were shooting a campfire
on the shores of Loch Ness

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.610 align:middle line:84%
at a little village
called Drumnadrochit.

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a lovely
name, isn't it?

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:27.713 align:middle line:90%
Drumnadrochit.

00:30:27.713 --> 00:30:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very Scottish.

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:30.165 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: And there was
Germans, there were Americans,

00:30:30.165 --> 00:30:32.935 align:middle line:84%
there were Canadians-- all
sharing this lovely campfire.

00:30:32.935 --> 00:30:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was a beautiful,
beautiful, starry night.

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And I had my back
towards the loch.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, this American
lady shouted out, what's that?

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:42.940 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And we all turned round and
the silhouette of the hills

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.380 align:middle line:84%
at the other side
of Loch Ness, there

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.360 align:middle line:84%
was this big ball
of light which was

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.520 align:middle line:90%
jumping up and down in the sky.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:53.340 align:middle line:90%
And it stopped.

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was making all
these bizarre movements.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.094 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, it just shot
off into the sky and was gone.

00:30:59.094 --> 00:31:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What color was it?

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: It was white.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:01.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: White?

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:01.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.113 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: White, white object.

00:31:03.113 --> 00:31:04.240 align:middle line:90%
And it was gone in seconds.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And we checked
airports-- nothing

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:09.090 align:middle line:84%
was flying in that
area at the time.

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:11.860 align:middle line:84%
There was another gentleman
who says, Malcolm,

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:14.400 align:middle line:84%
would you like to come up
and see UFOs where I live?

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.170 align:middle line:90%
I went, yeah.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:15.770 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:16.670 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:19.720 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, what
I do is I use a torch

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:24.164 align:middle line:84%
and I click my torch into
the night sky and bang, bang.

00:31:24.164 --> 00:31:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, those
laser flashlights.

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:26.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.883 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: And I
get bursts of light.

00:31:27.883 --> 00:31:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Bursts of light come
down from a cloudy sky.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bursts of light?

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.850 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:31.933 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: So I says, OK.

00:31:31.933 --> 00:31:32.930 align:middle line:90%
I've go to see this.

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:34.880 align:middle line:84%
So I traveled up
to a little place

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:38.110 align:middle line:84%
called Achiltibuie in
Wester Ross in Scotland.

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:40.645 align:middle line:84%
And again, thankfully, it
was a lovely, starry night.

00:31:40.645 --> 00:31:42.270 align:middle line:84%
We don't get a lot
of that in Scotland,

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:44.180 align:middle line:90%
but that night, it was lovely.

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And we got out of his car and
we walked maybe about 300,

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.570 align:middle line:90%
400 feet.

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:50.665 align:middle line:84%
And it was all moors
and Scottish hillside

00:31:50.665 --> 00:31:53.260 align:middle line:84%
and the Milky Way
was in the distance.

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And he-- well, Malcolm,
this is all I do.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.404 align:middle line:90%
This is a torch I use.

00:31:57.404 --> 00:31:58.320 align:middle line:90%
And this is what I do.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And he started clicking
his torch, Regina.

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:04.380 align:middle line:84%
I swear, hand on heart,
within about 30 seconds,

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.380 align:middle line:84%
this enormous column
of light descended

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.340 align:middle line:84%
from a clear, clear,
cloudless sky.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:09.724 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that's amazing.

00:32:09.724 --> 00:32:10.224 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:10.224 --> 00:32:12.380 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: And it came
down like a rope ladder.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.390 align:middle line:84%
If you had a flimsy rope
latter and you threw it

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:16.834 align:middle line:84%
over the wall-- It came down
in stages with rungs-- bop,

00:32:16.834 --> 00:32:18.870 align:middle line:84%
bop, bop, bop,
bop-- it came down.

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:19.990 align:middle line:90%
I had a camera.

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:22.080 align:middle line:90%
I had a camera around my chest.

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.547 align:middle line:84%
And I was too
gobsmacked to look--

00:32:23.547 --> 00:32:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: To look at it.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:25.940 align:middle line:90%
And I look at this.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
I just realize,

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:29.120 align:middle line:90%
I better take a photograph.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.560 align:middle line:84%
But by that time, it just-- boom
woof-- it was gone in seconds.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And he says, oh, I'm so
glad you saw that, Malcolm--

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:40.040 align:middle line:84%
so glad a researcher has come
all this way to see this.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And whilst it's great--
I never got a photograph,

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:47.614 align:middle line:84%
sadly-- whilst it's great for
me and it's part of the picture,

00:32:47.614 --> 00:32:49.280 align:middle line:84%
where does that lead
us as far as trying

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.900 align:middle line:90%
to convince the Joe public?

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's hard.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:54.000 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: It is.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.760 align:middle line:84%
My job is just to provide
information-- provide

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.480 align:middle line:84%
photographs and
testimony to people

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.170 align:middle line:90%
to make up their own minds.

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:05.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm not asking anybody to
believe anything I say.

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.090 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:09.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm just asking you to digest
it, search for yourself,

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:12.220 align:middle line:84%
and find out these answers
because like I say,

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.310 align:middle line:84%
we are dealing with
something real.

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A few years
ago, my husband Scott

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.630 align:middle line:90%
and I were in London.

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:20.060 align:middle line:90%
And this event happened.

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.724 align:middle line:84%
And don't know
what it was, but it

00:33:23.724 --> 00:33:26.140 align:middle line:84%
was in the middle of the daytime
and there were chemtrails

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:27.540 align:middle line:90%
laid across the sky.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And then about seven
or eight silver orbs

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.340 align:middle line:84%
started darting in and
flying into the chemtrails.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And then they would quickly
come out at another angle

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.070 align:middle line:90%
and then disappear.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And then they'd come back and
hover in the chemtrails again.

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.930 align:middle line:90%
And this is in daylight.

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:45.970 align:middle line:90%
We were at Portobello Road.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And we were both like
this, going, oh, my God.

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:50.480 align:middle line:90%
Watch those.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Do you know, not one person
on the street-- not one person

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:56.640 align:middle line:90%
looked up.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.754 align:middle line:84%
Now, wouldn't you
normally look up

00:33:58.754 --> 00:34:00.670 align:middle line:84%
if someone-- if you
walked by someone pointing

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:02.670 align:middle line:84%
into the sky, of course
you're going to look up.

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:04.390 align:middle line:84%
But not one person
would look up.

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And we thought, are we living
in some alternate reality here?

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Later on in the day,
we went Hyde Park.

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:12.840 align:middle line:84%
They came back-- whatever
they were-- and started

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:16.790 align:middle line:84%
darting in and out of chemtrails
again and blinking out again.

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:18.832 align:middle line:84%
We did the same thing--
ah, there they are again.

00:34:18.832 --> 00:34:19.914 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Nobody looked.

00:34:19.914 --> 00:34:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One person
came up and said to us,

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:25.020 align:middle line:84%
please, don't
scare the children.

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.571 align:middle line:90%
Now, how odd is that?

00:34:27.571 --> 00:34:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I've
seen other things--

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:31.040 align:middle line:84%
green balls of light in
the middle the night,

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.230 align:middle line:84%
crashing into the ground,
especially in Sedona,

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.939 align:middle line:90%
but other places.

00:34:33.939 --> 00:34:35.355 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: Yeah,
Sedona's lovely.

00:34:35.355 --> 00:34:37.949 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A green cigar craft
coming right in front of me,

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:40.739 align:middle line:84%
driving-- again, late
at night-- down a road.

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:42.699 align:middle line:90%
So I mean, it's all around.

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:45.590 align:middle line:84%
But that statement--
don't look up.

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:47.630 align:middle line:90%
Don't scare the children.

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:49.530 align:middle line:84%
That's the mentality
this is going against.

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:51.029 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: It's
very sad, isn't it?

00:34:51.029 --> 00:34:51.737 align:middle line:90%
That is very sad.

00:34:51.737 --> 00:34:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:53.933 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: I mean,
thankfully, we now

00:34:53.933 --> 00:34:56.800 align:middle line:84%
have lots of programs on all
the channels in America and here

00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:00.090 align:middle line:84%
in the UK, pertaining to ghosts
and UFOs, which is great.

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:02.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's where
we're going now, is ghosts.

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:02.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.060 align:middle line:84%
We have time to tell
some ghost stories.

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.110 align:middle line:84%
So let's do that,
because the two--

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:10.142 align:middle line:84%
and maybe give us a little
bridge between the two.

00:35:10.142 --> 00:35:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:13.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, part of my research
as a paranormal researchers

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:17.230 align:middle line:84%
is not just to look
into UFO sightings.

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:20.440 align:middle line:84%
It's also to look at the very
other side of that fence--

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:23.530 align:middle line:84%
the paranormal world-- the
ghosts, the poltergeists,

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:24.750 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest
with you, I guess

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:29.200 align:middle line:84%
that's where my true heart
lies, because I love spending

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.875 align:middle line:84%
nights in haunted houses,
seeing things move, et cetera.

00:35:32.875 --> 00:35:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to share
with your viewers

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:35.980 align:middle line:84%
just one of two
of these stories.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:36.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, we have time.

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:37.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.291 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Thanks.

00:35:38.291 --> 00:35:39.060 align:middle line:90%
That's brilliant.

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:41.150 align:middle line:84%
I remember once, we were
in this haunted house

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:44.610 align:middle line:90%
in the village of Stirling.

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And our psychic,
Mijam, who we always

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:47.770 align:middle line:90%
work with a good psychic.

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And she says, Malcolm, don't
you feel spirit in this room?

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:52.620 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:53.770 align:middle line:90%
It's all over the place.

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:55.940 align:middle line:84%
I says, no, I can't
feel anything.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:59.040 align:middle line:84%
She says, well, stand over there
at the other side of the room

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.680 align:middle line:84%
and extend your arm and ask
the spirit to touch you.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:04.380 align:middle line:84%
So I stood at the
other side of the room

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:08.410 align:middle line:84%
feeling very, very
foolish, Regina.

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:10.620 align:middle line:84%
If there's anybody
from spirit, kindly

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:13.120 align:middle line:90%
touch the back of my hand.

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.580 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened for a minute.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Two minutes-- nothing;
three minutes-- nothing.

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And then on the fourth minute,
this big pressure pushed down

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.502 align:middle line:84%
on my hand and it slapped
the side of my leg and boy,

00:36:23.502 --> 00:36:25.230 align:middle line:90%
did I get a fright.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:26.420 align:middle line:90%
It was incredible.

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:27.620 align:middle line:90%
It really was.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has got
unconscious muscular movement.

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, our hand always twitches,
but this was forceful.

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:34.906 align:middle line:90%
This was a depression.

00:36:34.906 --> 00:36:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was cold
and it was clammy

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.130 align:middle line:90%
and it pushed down on my hand.

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And I gained these
things-- it's the fuel

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:42.940 align:middle line:90%
for the fire of my interest.

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.180 align:middle line:84%
We were in another
case in Tullibody.

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:47.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a small village
near Stirling.

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And we had the video cameras
going, the audio cameras going,

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:54.510 align:middle line:90%
et cetera-- sound recorders.

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:56.210 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was happening.

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:58.360 align:middle line:90%
And I says, why did I do this?

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Why did I get involved
in the subject?

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.140 align:middle line:90%
And then it happened again.

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, bang-- the
whole room was illuminated

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:11.080 align:middle line:84%
by thousands and thousands of
tiny pinpricks of white light.

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.320 align:middle line:84%
It was like a children's--
here in the UK,

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.480 align:middle line:84%
we have on November the
5th Guy Fawkes night--

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.947 align:middle line:84%
a handheld sparkler which a
light-- it's just this long,

00:37:17.947 --> 00:37:18.530 align:middle line:90%
thin sparkles.

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, we have
those in the US, too.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Do you have them?

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
called sparklers.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:20.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:21.779 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Hey, there you go.

00:37:21.779 --> 00:37:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it
was like, Regina.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.200 align:middle line:84%
It was like a whole
room was exploding--

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.520 align:middle line:90%
in all these sparkly lights.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
over the ceiling.

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:28.700 align:middle line:90%
It was all over the walls.

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:29.908 align:middle line:90%
It was all over your clothes.

00:37:29.908 --> 00:37:31.900 align:middle line:90%
It was all over the carpets.

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:34.306 align:middle line:84%
And I said to our psychic,
what on earth is this?

00:37:34.306 --> 00:37:35.660 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Oh, Malcolm, you
should know better.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.090 align:middle line:90%
What is it, then?

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:40.850 align:middle line:84%
She says, that's
pure psychic energy.

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:44.540 align:middle line:84%
It's just the spirits letting
us know that they're here.

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:45.040 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:45.960 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.390 align:middle line:84%
So within about
27 seconds, it was

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:51.270 align:middle line:90%
like a dimmer switch on a wall.

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:54.030 align:middle line:84%
It just slowly, slowly,
slowly, slowly got dark.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And bang, you're
back in darkness.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:58.840 align:middle line:90%
So we crossed our fingers.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:02.690 align:middle line:84%
We went to the VCR, pressed
Stop, pressed Rewind,

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:04.560 align:middle line:90%
pressed Play.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.920 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was there.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.290 align:middle line:84%
We were so disappointed
that we never

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:10.840 align:middle line:84%
managed to capture
something on film.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.920 align:middle line:84%
But even if we had,
Regina, would that

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.680 align:middle line:90%
have proved our point?

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:18.230 align:middle line:84%
People night have said, you
manufactured that on-- you've

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:19.710 align:middle line:90%
doctored the evidence.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.830 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes even
with the proof,

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:25.410 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult to relay
that proof to Joe public.

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is, but there
are proofs that do exist.

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And remind me the name of the
group in Britain-- Montague,

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:36.700 align:middle line:84%
who was part of the group and
passed over to the other side,

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:37.600 align:middle line:90%
and they were doing--

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: The
Scole Experiment?

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Scole
Experiment, yes.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:41.395 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's
talk just a wee bit

00:38:41.395 --> 00:38:43.580 align:middle line:84%
about the Scole
Experiment, because this

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:48.072 align:middle line:84%
was a matter of
getting audio proofs.

00:38:48.072 --> 00:38:48.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.800 align:middle line:84%
The Scole Experiment was
fascinating for me as well.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.050 align:middle line:84%
It was a number of
years ago in Norfolk.

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:57.780 align:middle line:84%
There, many researchers
and like minded individuals

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:01.800 align:middle line:84%
sat in a seance room for
quite a number of weeks.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And they managed to get a whole
range of paranormal effects

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:07.820 align:middle line:84%
occurring in that
room-- balls of light.

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:10.252 align:middle line:84%
They even had a gentleman
who they called-- well,

00:39:10.252 --> 00:39:11.710 align:middle line:84%
for want of a better
word, I'll say

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:14.290 align:middle line:84%
gentleman-- this
chap called Blue.

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:16.950 align:middle line:84%
It was like an alien--
the pear-shaped head

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:18.330 align:middle line:90%
and the piercing eyes.

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And there was a blue,
tint, et cetera.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.710 align:middle line:84%
They were getting touched
on the back of their neck.

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:25.930 align:middle line:84%
They were getting
voices coming round.

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:28.690 align:middle line:84%
They had a lot of
sounds on audiotape.

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And for me, this was
probably the best evidence--

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:35.220 align:middle line:84%
in the Scole Experiment-- that's
ever been registered anywhere

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:37.309 align:middle line:90%
in the world for people.

00:39:37.309 --> 00:39:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the voice was
talking from the other side

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.952 align:middle line:84%
through to them and they
got the recordings of it.

00:39:41.952 --> 00:39:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: And
that's so important

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:46.250 align:middle line:84%
because they got these audio
recordings from people.

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And it always like,
they asked the question

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:49.630 align:middle line:90%
and they got a response.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:50.622 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:50.622 --> 00:39:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: And it
was fascinating.

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.200 align:middle line:10%
I will just hope that
your viewers look up

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.650 align:middle line:10%
the Scole Experiment on
Google or just look for that.

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:56.754 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:56.754 --> 00:39:57.860 align:middle line:10%
There was a film done about it.

00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:58.690 align:middle line:10%
I remember that.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:01.550 align:middle line:84%
I saw it when it first
aired-- one of the premieres.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:02.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: And that
was a fascinating case.

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:04.080 align:middle line:90%
It really was.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.603 align:middle line:90%
That's worth looking into.

00:40:05.603 --> 00:40:08.029 align:middle line:84%
But then while we're on
the subject of seances,

00:40:08.029 --> 00:40:09.820 align:middle line:84%
you have one that you'd
like to talk about.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I have some
questions about that.

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where it
gets fun, because people

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.502 align:middle line:84%
do this as kind of a
parlor game, but it's not.

00:40:16.502 --> 00:40:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:17.500 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.749 align:middle line:90%
I'm mean, don't get me wrong.

00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Even though I believe
in life after death--

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:21.640 align:middle line:90%
the evidence is overwhelming.

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.223 align:middle line:84%
It suggests it--
even though I believe

00:40:23.223 --> 00:40:26.010 align:middle line:84%
in the validity of alien
technology and aliens

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:30.390 align:middle line:84%
because evidence for me-- I
accept it because it's there,

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:32.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm still skeptical.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And this case I'm talking about
now-- the Chingford seance

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:38.420 align:middle line:84%
near London-- this lady
says to me, Malcolm,

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:40.915 align:middle line:84%
would you like to
see dead people?

00:40:40.915 --> 00:40:42.350 align:middle line:90%
I says, yeah, of course I would.

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:43.980 align:middle line:90%
That's why I do it.

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:46.500 align:middle line:84%
So I arranged a time
to go and see her.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:50.640 align:middle line:84%
She was holding a seance in
her family home in Chingford.

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And she took me upstairs
to the back bedroom

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.870 align:middle line:84%
where I inspected
the walls to make

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:58.244 align:middle line:84%
sure there were no hidden
cavities for recording units.

00:40:58.244 --> 00:40:59.910 align:middle line:84%
I put my foot on the
floorboards to make

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:02.070 align:middle line:84%
sure nothing was hidden
in the floorboards.

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:04.480 align:middle line:84%
There was a small
unit-- a bedroom unit

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.190 align:middle line:90%
in the back of the wall.

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:09.210 align:middle line:84%
There was a black cape
going across the corner--

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:12.360 align:middle line:84%
a big black cape and a
small white chair, of which

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:14.900 align:middle line:84%
the visiting medium would sit
there later on in the evening.

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:16.150 align:middle line:90%
I'll come back to that.

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:18.275 align:middle line:84%
And there was a small chest
of drawers in the room.

00:41:18.275 --> 00:41:21.190 align:middle line:84%
So there were very little
furniture in that room.

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:22.890 align:middle line:84%
She then took me
to another room,

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:26.530 align:middle line:84%
and it was a small glass case
about so high-- big glass

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:27.170 align:middle line:90%
shelves.

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And there were rings on
it and there were coins.

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:30.750 align:middle line:90%
I says, what that?

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:33.510 align:middle line:84%
She says, this is
called an apport.

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:36.510 align:middle line:84%
These fall down from
nothing-- from in the air.

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And you pick them
up and they're hot.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.410 align:middle line:90%
They're called apports.

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite common
in a seance room.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:46.500 align:middle line:84%
You can get coins, rings--
a whole range of things.

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So later that night, the
psychic medium came up.

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And I checked his person to
make sure there were no hidden

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:54.410 align:middle line:84%
telescopic roads or
anything like that.

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:56.224 align:middle line:90%
And I was happy with it.

00:41:56.224 --> 00:41:58.390 align:middle line:84%
We pulled back the curtain
at the corner of the room

00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:59.720 align:middle line:90%
and I sat him in the chair.

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And we used these Velcro
straps to strap him

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:03.865 align:middle line:90%
to the chair like this.

00:42:03.865 --> 00:42:05.130 align:middle line:90%
I says, you comfortable?

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:06.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I'm comfortable.

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:07.830 align:middle line:90%
And we drew the curtain back.

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is at the
corner of the room.

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And then we switched the
lights off in this room

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:15.440 align:middle line:84%
and there was a
small, red ambient

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.449 align:middle line:84%
light that silhouetted
all the sitters.

00:42:17.449 --> 00:42:18.990 align:middle line:84%
There were about
four or five sitters

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:21.080 align:middle line:90%
in the room with me, Regina.

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.747 align:middle line:84%
And your eyes adjusted
to the darkness--

00:42:22.747 --> 00:42:23.496 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sitters?

00:42:23.496 --> 00:42:25.285 align:middle line:84%
Other people sitting
that were part of it?

00:42:25.285 --> 00:42:25.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Sitters.

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:25.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:25.930 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And your eyes adjusted
to the darkness

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.130 align:middle line:90%
and you could see that.

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly--
unbelievable.

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:32.940 align:middle line:90%
Unbelievable.

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What happened?

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: You heard
all these voices-- voices

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:38.360 align:middle line:84%
from sprit-- male, female,
young, old-- coming from there,

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.240 align:middle line:84%
coming from there,
coming from there,

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:41.510 align:middle line:84%
coming from under your
chair-- all over the room.

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:42.600 align:middle line:90%
And I'm still skeptical.

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, who's
throwing their voices?

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:46.240 align:middle line:90%
Is this a trick?

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.020 align:middle line:90%
No, this is true.

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was right up
at my ear, this voice.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:49.630 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going like that.

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:51.120 align:middle line:90%
And nobody was sitting there.

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.210 align:middle line:84%
They were all sitting-- the
other people were there.

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:57.609 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, this black
cape at the corner of the room

00:42:57.609 --> 00:42:59.400 align:middle line:84%
pushed itself out in
the middle of the room

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.170 align:middle line:84%
and you could see
this face-- this face

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:03.390 align:middle line:84%
molded into the
drape of this cloth.

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And as it did so, you
saw the sitter's feet--

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.975 align:middle line:84%
this psychic medium who was
behind-- you could see his feet

00:43:08.975 --> 00:43:11.700 align:middle line:84%
were planted firmly
on the floor.

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:14.970 align:middle line:84%
So he wasn't getting up off
his chair to move his hands.

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:16.940 align:middle line:84%
This is clearly
another face and it

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.260 align:middle line:90%
was moving all over the cape.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
this small chest

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:25.520 align:middle line:84%
of drawers which was right
next to this black-- the cape

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:26.650 align:middle line:90%
went in by the way.

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:28.720 align:middle line:84%
The face shape came
in then it would stop.

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:31.270 align:middle line:84%
The small chest of drawers
which was sitting next

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:35.210 align:middle line:84%
to this black cape
started to wobble.

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:37.326 align:middle line:84%
And then it rose up into
the air-- honest to God,

00:43:37.326 --> 00:43:39.850 align:middle line:84%
this was incredible--
it rose up into the air

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:44.520 align:middle line:84%
and floated across the room
and stopped in front of my face

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.830 align:middle line:90%
and fell right at my toes.

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:48.935 align:middle line:84%
And boy, did I get
a fright, Regina.

00:43:48.935 --> 00:43:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I bet.

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: It was really scary.

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And then the spirit voice--
it sounds something out

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:56.020 align:middle line:84%
of Hollywood I'm saying,
but it's the truth.

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:56.770 align:middle line:90%
Please believe me.

00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:58.070 align:middle line:90%
It's the truth.

00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:02.185 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, this voice boomed out,
was Malcolm impressed by this?

00:44:02.185 --> 00:44:04.650 align:middle line:90%
I went, oh, my God.

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Certainly
frightened and impressed.

00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:07.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'd
be more impressed

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.620 align:middle line:90%
if you took it back the way.

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And then this voice boomed out,
we shall see what we can do.

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:18.180 align:middle line:84%
So I did a cardinal
sin-- something

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:22.080 align:middle line:84%
that you should never do,
Regina, in psychic seances.

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:25.629 align:middle line:84%
I tried to stop the psychic
phenomena from happening.

00:44:25.629 --> 00:44:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: You
shouldn't do that.

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.097 align:middle line:90%
It's dangerous to a psychic.

00:44:28.097 --> 00:44:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: And maybe I
shouldn't be admitting this,

00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:31.010 align:middle line:90%
but I did.

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:33.310 align:middle line:84%
What I did was, I
hooked my finger

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:35.570 align:middle line:84%
under the lip of this
small chest of drawers

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:37.310 align:middle line:84%
which was sitting
in front of me.

00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And I says to myself, this
thing's going nowhere.

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:41.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:45.110 align:middle line:90%
You can take it back now.

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Nothing happened for
about 30, 40 seconds.

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And it suddenly--
nobody was there--

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:52.150 align:middle line:84%
it started vibrating
very, very violently.

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:53.320 align:middle line:90%
Nobody was there.

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:56.350 align:middle line:84%
The sitters-- the people
were about two feet there.

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:58.520 align:middle line:84%
I could quite clearly see
there was a space there

00:44:58.520 --> 00:44:59.920 align:middle line:90%
and there was a space there.

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:00.940 align:middle line:90%
And it started to move.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.330 align:middle line:90%
And I tried to pull it back.

00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:03.690 align:middle line:90%
I was pulling it back.

00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And it just, like a hot
knife through butter,

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:09.190 align:middle line:84%
floated away up into the middle
of the room and went back

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:12.970 align:middle line:84%
and fell very violently
and went thud on the floor.

00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- and just then, this
wind-- the prevailing wind--

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:23.430 align:middle line:84%
this cold, cold, cold, wind
rushed through the room.

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:26.716 align:middle line:84%
[EXHALES] My breath was
freezing up. [EXHALES]

00:45:26.716 --> 00:45:27.287 align:middle line:90%


00:45:27.287 --> 00:45:28.870 align:middle line:84%
You could see your
breath freezing up.

00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:31.550 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely freezing.

00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And there was all these
little silver bells

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:36.706 align:middle line:84%
that the occupant of the house--
the person who owned the house

00:45:36.706 --> 00:45:38.330 align:middle line:84%
had tacked onto the
walls of the house.

00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:40.490 align:middle line:90%
They were all tingling, moving.

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of the
most fascinating things

00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:43.906 align:middle line:90%
that I've ever seen.

00:45:43.906 --> 00:45:46.725 align:middle line:84%
And how I wished your viewers
had been with me that night.

00:45:46.725 --> 00:45:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I wish I could've
been with you there, too.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:49.023 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: And you.

00:45:49.023 --> 00:45:49.710 align:middle line:90%
And you.

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:50.251 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:50.251 --> 00:45:53.630 align:middle line:84%
So when this happened and it
dropped the dresser back down,

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:54.636 align:middle line:90%
were there any messages?

00:45:54.636 --> 00:45:56.010 align:middle line:84%
A moment ago, you
said you really

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.722 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't try to counter that
if you're in that situation

00:45:58.722 --> 00:45:59.680 align:middle line:90%
because it's dangerous.

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.305 align:middle line:84%
Now, what actually happened
and then why is it dangerous?

00:46:02.305 --> 00:46:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: Well, it's
dangerous in the sense

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:07.570 align:middle line:84%
that because I was trying to
stop the psychic phenomena

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:10.090 align:middle line:84%
happening-- all this is
building up from the psychic--

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:12.520 align:middle line:84%
this medium chap who
was sitting there.

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.170 align:middle line:84%
He's in tune with
the spirit world.

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And me trying to stop
that affects him-- it

00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:19.960 align:middle line:90%
does affect him.

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:24.770 align:middle line:84%
So I got up a few moments later
and I moved the curtain back

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:27.110 align:middle line:84%
and his head was gently
resting on his chest.

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:29.270 align:middle line:90%
And there was this glow.

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:34.494 align:middle line:84%
It was like a whitish, blue glow
pervading all over his face.

00:46:34.494 --> 00:46:36.410 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't see where the
glow was coming from.

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:38.510 align:middle line:84%
There was only a small,
red light in the room.

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And this glow--
this beautiful glow.

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And I touched him again
to make sure he was not

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:43.870 align:middle line:90%
hiding anything.

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:45.190 align:middle line:90%
And nothing was there.

00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:46.400 align:middle line:90%
It was very bizarre.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:50.420 align:middle line:84%
But you can harm people because
as I say, you try to stop that

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:52.000 align:middle line:90%
and that affects the psychic.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.484 align:middle line:90%
And I put my hand up-- I did.

00:46:54.484 --> 00:46:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the things
I've experienced

00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:01.150 align:middle line:84%
is there was this
woman named Olga

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:03.380 align:middle line:84%
who was in the town
I was in at the time

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:06.060 align:middle line:84%
and people said oh, she's
a marvelous medium if you

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:08.300 align:middle line:90%
want to contact the deceased.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And she just fell into this
little group I was with

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.720 align:middle line:90%
and I said, oh, that sounds fun.

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:15.983 align:middle line:90%
And she did table tapping.

00:47:15.983 --> 00:47:16.816 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Oh, yes.

00:47:16.816 --> 00:47:16.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:17.471 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:47:17.471 --> 00:47:19.910 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that
phenomena, because at the time

00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:21.326 align:middle line:84%
when you're doing
that, you think,

00:47:21.326 --> 00:47:24.710 align:middle line:84%
well, is it just a buildup
of our own psychic energy

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:26.070 align:middle line:90%
that's making that table move?

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Because you put a finger
on it and the thing

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.830 align:middle line:84%
is raring up like
a bucking bronco

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:32.260 align:middle line:90%
and slamming into the ground.

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't see Olga
doing anything more

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.910 align:middle line:84%
than putting her finger
on the table, as well.

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Talk about this
phenomena a little bit.

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: Yeah, table
tilting-- table tapping

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:43.560 align:middle line:84%
has been with us for hundreds
and hundreds of years.

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.649 align:middle line:90%
In the Victorian England--

00:47:44.649 --> 00:47:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a very primitive
way to get information.

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: It is.

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And they used to
do parlor tricks

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:50.930 align:middle line:90%
where they would try this.

00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:52.630 align:middle line:90%
I've tried it myself.

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:53.690 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:55.110 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Other reserachers-- we had
our hands on the table--

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.030 align:middle line:84%
not under the table, obviously,
but on top of the table.

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:03.510 align:middle line:90%
And it was a heavy wooden table.

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And we asked if anybody was from
spirit side, if you were there,

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:10.420 align:middle line:84%
kindly let us know you were
there in the room that evening.

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, there was a
couple knocks on the table.

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And that was strange
because everybody's hands

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.360 align:middle line:90%
was on the table.

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:22.131 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, the whole
table flipped up like that.

00:48:22.131 --> 00:48:22.755 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:22.755 --> 00:48:23.254 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:48:23.254 --> 00:48:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: And I had this
flattened table on my nose.

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:28.120 align:middle line:90%
It rose right up on my nose.

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And everybody had to more
or less kind of break away.

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:32.670 align:middle line:90%
And then I says, OK, OK, OK.

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:33.410 align:middle line:90%
You're here.

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:34.370 align:middle line:90%
We know you're here.

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Could you move the
table back now, please?

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:40.798 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, this heavy
table-- when it got to an angle,

00:48:40.798 --> 00:48:43.256 align:middle line:84%
gravity would have dictated it
should have just fell of its

00:48:43.256 --> 00:48:43.759 align:middle line:90%
own accord--

00:48:43.759 --> 00:48:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:44.950 align:middle line:90%
It stays there.

00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:45.140 align:middle line:90%
It hovers.

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:45.350 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: --but it didn't.

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: It stayed there.

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:47.969 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: It
stayed there, Regina.

00:48:47.969 --> 00:48:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
it just gently

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:52.260 align:middle line:84%
went down of its own
accord with people's hands

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:55.460 align:middle line:84%
on top-- not below--
on top of the table.

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.357 align:middle line:84%
On another occasion I've
tried it, it came up

00:48:57.357 --> 00:48:59.440 align:middle line:84%
and it more or less was
dancing all over the room.

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.840 align:middle line:84%
We actually had to
get off our chair

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.950 align:middle line:84%
and it was moving
all over the room.

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:06.300 align:middle line:90%
And it is a tool.

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:08.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a tool that
psychic researchers

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:10.210 align:middle line:90%
use to contact other side.

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:11.910 align:middle line:90%
People use the Ouija boards.

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:16.060 align:middle line:84%
I do not advocate using
that because it's dangerous.

00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, talk
about that for a moment.

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yes.

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:18.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In fact, that
was my next question is,

00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:23.140 align:middle line:84%
what about our-- that's the
most common interface people

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:24.739 align:middle line:84%
start playing with
when they're kids.

00:49:24.739 --> 00:49:25.405 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yes.

00:49:25.405 --> 00:49:25.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:27.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that.

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:28.404 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: It's dangerous.

00:49:28.404 --> 00:49:30.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not all to do
with the spirit world

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:31.860 align:middle line:90%
is nice and rosy, et cetera.

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:35.530 align:middle line:84%
There is a nasty
element of that.

00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Some of your viewers
may be aware of these,

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:40.704 align:middle line:84%
what we call lower astral
entities-- these people who

00:49:40.704 --> 00:49:43.120 align:middle line:84%
can't accept the fact that
they've passed on to the spirit

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.060 align:middle line:84%
world and tend to hang
around the Earth plane.

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Again, it sounds Hollywood, but
this is what they're saying.

00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:48.430 align:middle line:90%
No, this is true.

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:48.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:50.105 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: And
so anybody that's

00:49:50.105 --> 00:49:54.584 align:middle line:84%
going into this-- a Ouija board,
they'll suddenly see somebody's

00:49:54.584 --> 00:49:56.000 align:middle line:84%
trying to make
contact and they'll

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.847 align:middle line:84%
try and kid on your Uncle
John or your Auntie Agnes

00:50:00.847 --> 00:50:01.680 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:03.310 align:middle line:90%
They'll give false names.

00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:05.286 align:middle line:84%
And then they can smash
tumblers, as well--

00:50:05.286 --> 00:50:07.160 align:middle line:84%
make a lot of disturbance
in the family home.

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tumblers
meaning glasses.

00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:08.424 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Sorry.

00:50:08.424 --> 00:50:08.546 align:middle line:90%
Glasses.

00:50:08.546 --> 00:50:08.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Smash glasses.

00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:09.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:11.113 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: Smash
glasses in the room.

00:50:11.113 --> 00:50:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And it can be very, very
traumatic and disturbing

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:16.630 align:middle line:84%
to young children of an age
where they shouldn't really

00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:17.646 align:middle line:90%
be doing this.

00:50:17.646 --> 00:50:19.020 align:middle line:84%
The sad thing
about a Ouija board

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:22.410 align:middle line:84%
is it does work but is it,
again, our own mind this

00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:27.560 align:middle line:84%
is pushing the planchette or
the glass or is it truly spirit?

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:28.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a bit of both.

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.590 align:middle line:84%
I still believe that
spirit is using this

00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:33.740 align:middle line:84%
as a tool to make
contact, absolutely.

00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:35.320 align:middle line:90%
But it's a bit of both.

00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:37.680 align:middle line:90%
And so it can be dangerous.

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.704 align:middle line:84%
Just getting back
to another case

00:50:39.704 --> 00:50:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I should mention
to your viewers--

00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please do.

00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:41.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:43.398 align:middle line:84%
We still have a
little bit of time.

00:50:43.398 --> 00:50:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: We spoke about
poltergeists a moment ago.

00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:49.680 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest
poltergeist cases

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:52.600 align:middle line:84%
that's ever occurred
in Scotland happened

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:54.690 align:middle line:84%
when I was only about
three years of age.

00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:57.590 align:middle line:84%
But I re-investigated
it some years later.

00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:00.570 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
Sauchie poltergeist.

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:03.980 align:middle line:84%
It happened to a
young, 11-year-old girl

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:05.710 align:middle line:90%
who came over from Donegal.

00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:08.010 align:middle line:90%
Virginia Campbell was her name.

00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:10.214 align:middle line:84%
Her parents left
Donegal in Ireland.

00:51:10.214 --> 00:51:11.380 align:middle line:90%
And she didn't want to move.

00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:12.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to move.

00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:14.160 align:middle line:84%
This is my family--
my friends here.

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:15.210 align:middle line:90%
You're going to Scotland.

00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:17.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to go to Scotland.

00:51:17.310 --> 00:51:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And she came over
with her family

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:21.250 align:middle line:84%
and settled in a small
town called Sauchie,

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:25.370 align:middle line:84%
which is near Alloa, about
40 miles from Glasgow.

00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:27.210 align:middle line:84%
No sooner were they
in this family home

00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:29.320 align:middle line:84%
than strange things
started to happen.

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:33.530 align:middle line:84%
[KNOCKING] There were knockings
on the wall like a ping pong

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:36.400 align:middle line:84%
ball being bounced, bounced,
bounced, bounced off the wall.

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:39.690 align:middle line:84%
There was a heavy linen
chest where, in Scotland, you

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:43.560 align:middle line:84%
store your clothes and sheets
rose up off the floor--

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:46.610 align:middle line:84%
several feet off the floor--
and fell back down again.

00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:50.520 align:middle line:84%
It got so bad they had
to ask the local doctor

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:53.440 align:middle line:84%
to come in because they thought
maybe the young girl was

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.070 align:middle line:90%
suffering from something.

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So the doctor went
upstairs to the bedroom

00:51:57.930 --> 00:52:01.930 align:middle line:84%
and Virginia was lying on
the head on the pillow.

00:52:01.930 --> 00:52:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor went to
help her, and he suddenly

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:07.400 align:middle line:84%
saw the pillow
next to her depress

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:09.380 align:middle line:84%
as if a secondary
invisible head just

00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:11.690 align:middle line:90%
went-- what's going on here?

00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And then the doctor himself got
pushed in that particular room

00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:17.580 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, events got so bad they
even followed her to her school.

00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:24.900 align:middle line:90%
She went to the local school.

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And in 1960-- this
is when it happened.

00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:31.550 align:middle line:84%
1960-- in Scotland, you
had these old wooden desks.

00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And the teacher at the
front of the class looked up

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:38.300 align:middle line:84%
and all-- it was just a
sea of small kids' faces.

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And Virginia had her arms
down on the desk like--

00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:43.950 align:middle line:90%
Virginia, what you doing?

00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:44.590 align:middle line:90%
Stop that.

00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:45.650 align:middle line:90%
What you doing?

00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And she took her arms
away and the desk lid's

00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:49.910 align:middle line:84%
flapping up of it
its own accord.

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And in another occasion,
she went to the teacher

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.410 align:middle line:90%
with these jotters-- essays?

00:52:55.410 --> 00:52:58.417 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how you would say
in America-- a project that you

00:52:58.417 --> 00:52:59.250 align:middle line:90%
had been working on.

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, like
a little-- is it

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:03.639 align:middle line:84%
like a paper booklet
or something?

00:53:03.639 --> 00:53:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: That's right.

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:04.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:07.379 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: And she had been
working on something like that.

00:53:07.379 --> 00:53:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And she went to
present these papers.

00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And she laid them on
the teacher's desk.

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
the teacher's cane--

00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:18.425 align:middle line:84%
they had a pointing cane
because in 1960, in the schools,

00:53:18.425 --> 00:53:20.550 align:middle line:84%
you had a blackboard and
the teacher had a big cane

00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:22.390 align:middle line:90%
to point to the blackboard.

00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:25.050 align:middle line:84%
It was lying flat on
the teacher's table.

00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:27.380 align:middle line:90%
And it started to vibrate.

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And then it stood up vertically
and started bang, bang, bang,

00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:33.422 align:middle line:90%
in front of the whole class.

00:53:33.422 --> 00:53:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, goodness.

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: The
whole kids saw this.

00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:37.960 align:middle line:90%
As it was a big, big table.

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, this table
rose up a couple of inches

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:44.130 align:middle line:84%
off the floor and started-- it
was like something in a film,

00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:46.360 align:middle line:90%
this-- started moving across.

00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:48.540 align:middle line:84%
So whereas before,
the teacher was

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:50.800 align:middle line:84%
in the long part of
the table, the table

00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:52.540 align:middle line:84%
had lifted up in front
of the whole class

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:54.469 align:middle line:90%
and rotated 90 degrees.

00:53:54.469 --> 00:53:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And then now the
table was in front--

00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:58.970 align:middle line:84%
the small part of the table
was in front of her stomach.

00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:00.600 align:middle line:90%
And that was a major case.

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:03.590 align:middle line:84%
It lasted for about
six, seven months.

00:54:03.590 --> 00:54:04.810 align:middle line:90%
And the family disappeared.

00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:08.580 align:middle line:84%
They just left Scotland
and moved down to England.

00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:10.480 align:middle line:84%
But there's so much
more to that case.

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's much, much more
different than a ghost case

00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:16.930 align:middle line:90%
because this is disruptive.

00:54:16.930 --> 00:54:19.030 align:middle line:84%
A poltergeist is
very disruptive.

00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in the few
minutes we have remaining,

00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:25.114 align:middle line:84%
give us an idea of
how you've integrated

00:54:25.114 --> 00:54:26.780 align:middle line:84%
all of this-- what
you think is going on

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and what you think
our opportunity is

00:54:29.110 --> 00:54:32.410 align:middle line:84%
to start consciously
welcoming interface

00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:35.960 align:middle line:84%
with other dimensions of
reality-- UFOs and so forth--

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:38.720 align:middle line:84%
rather than the governments
trying to obscure and hide

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:41.940 align:middle line:84%
information-- people feeling
embarrassed to share it.

00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:43.440 align:middle line:90%
Where do we go with this now?

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: Well,
certainly all UFO groups

00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:46.635 align:middle line:84%
from not only the
United Kingdom,

00:54:46.635 --> 00:54:49.210 align:middle line:84%
but France, Belgium,
America, and Canada

00:54:49.210 --> 00:54:52.730 align:middle line:84%
should pool all their resources
together and work closely

00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:53.560 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Because sadly, in
this day and age,

00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:58.010 align:middle line:84%
there's some in-house
fighting and stuff like that.

00:54:58.010 --> 00:55:01.210 align:middle line:84%
It's very clear that
the American government

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:03.010 align:middle line:84%
knows more than
they're letting on.

00:55:03.010 --> 00:55:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Under the Freedom
of Information Act,

00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:07.570 align:middle line:84%
many preclassified
government documents

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:10.300 align:middle line:84%
pertaining to the CIA,
the NSA, and the FBI

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:13.140 align:middle line:84%
clearly showed that the
government of America--

00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:17.425 align:middle line:84%
and the UK British fails--
were looking very seriously

00:55:17.425 --> 00:55:18.520 align:middle line:90%
at the UFO enigma.

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:19.740 align:middle line:90%
Was it a Russian thing?

00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Was it the Russians
that's coming?

00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And when you look very closely
at some of these documentation,

00:55:24.590 --> 00:55:26.690 align:middle line:84%
you see that some of
the pages are heavily

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:28.915 align:middle line:84%
blacked out-- big
paragraphs blacked out.

00:55:28.915 --> 00:55:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
they're all redacted.

00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:29.405 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:55:29.405 --> 00:55:30.750 align:middle line:90%
You could read every tenth word.

00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:31.916 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: It's ridiculous.

00:55:31.916 --> 00:55:34.459 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
the governments know

00:55:34.459 --> 00:55:36.000 align:middle line:84%
of much more than
they're letting on.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:36.840 align:middle line:90%
Now, why is that?

00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Is it because-- as
we spoke earlier,

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Regina-- it's maybe they're
working side by side

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:43.110 align:middle line:90%
in black budget programs?

00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:45.150 align:middle line:90%
Or is it something else?

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:48.150 align:middle line:84%
There is a phenomena to
be looked at, for sure.

00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:51.700 align:middle line:84%
I firmly believe that we are
being visited by creatures--

00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:54.790 align:middle line:84%
aliens-- call them what you
will-- not of this earth.

00:55:54.790 --> 00:55:56.880 align:middle line:90%
They've always been with us.

00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:59.470 align:middle line:84%
It may not necessarily
be extraterrestrial.

00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:03.250 align:middle line:84%
I think it possibly could
be more inter-dimensional.

00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:06.520 align:middle line:84%
There are many sightings have
been seen of objects coming out

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.780 align:middle line:84%
of the oceans of
this planet, mostly

00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:10.559 align:middle line:84%
around the island
of Puerto Rico where

00:56:10.559 --> 00:56:11.850 align:middle line:90%
many sightings have been seen--

00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:13.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And off Los
Angeles Channel Islands.

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:14.520 align:middle line:90%
Lots in that corridor.

00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Absolutely.

00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: And so I think
perhaps they're already here.

00:56:17.410 --> 00:56:19.050 align:middle line:84%
They may have bases
on this planet

00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:20.970 align:middle line:90%
in the oceans of the world.

00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's something we have
to look at very carefully.

00:56:24.050 --> 00:56:28.140 align:middle line:84%
My agreement today is to
get this information out

00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:29.340 align:middle line:90%
to the public.

00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And I struggle with it
because we've got photographs.

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.990 align:middle line:84%
We've got good video
footage, et cetera.

00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:38.680 align:middle line:84%
What do we need to
prove the skeptics?

00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There seems to
be adequate proof there,

00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:44.140 align:middle line:84%
but if you have a media
completely aligned against that

00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:46.490 align:middle line:84%
making the light of day,
that's part of the problem.

00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: It's a big problem.

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:49.070 align:middle line:90%
I think the media connect.

00:56:49.070 --> 00:56:49.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:51.350 align:middle line:90%
The media control the masses.

00:56:51.350 --> 00:56:53.190 align:middle line:84%
The media dictate
what will be seen

00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:56.410 align:middle line:84%
and what will not be seen,
and more so here in the United

00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:57.280 align:middle line:90%
Kingdom.

00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And that annoys me because
the big picture is not

00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:01.805 align:middle line:90%
being put out to the public.

00:57:01.805 --> 00:57:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: It's not.

00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And I can only hope that
these sightings continue

00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:11.690 align:middle line:84%
because we're dealing with more
and more sightings these days.

00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:13.850 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with not
just classic flying

00:57:13.850 --> 00:57:15.960 align:middle line:84%
saucer ships and much
anymore, as you probably

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:19.150 align:middle line:84%
know-- these black triangular
shaped objects which

00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:21.317 align:middle line:84%
are about the size of six,
seven football fields.

00:57:21.317 --> 00:57:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:23.090 align:middle line:90%
Phoenix Lights and so forth.

00:57:23.090 --> 00:57:23.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Exactly.

00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:24.509 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:57:24.509 --> 00:57:27.340 align:middle line:84%
They fly silently and
slowly-- majestically

00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:30.640 align:middle line:84%
across the skies of
the UK and the States.

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And if that's our
own technology,

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:35.920 align:middle line:84%
my goodness me, it's
staggering, isn't it?

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:38.330 align:middle line:84%
But yes, we're dealing with
something very real here.

00:57:38.330 --> 00:57:40.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what about
just on an ordinary level,

00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:43.110 align:middle line:84%
where you're walking
through a room

00:57:43.110 --> 00:57:45.590 align:middle line:84%
and you see someone moving
out of the corner of your eye,

00:57:45.590 --> 00:57:47.040 align:middle line:90%
but there's no one there?

00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:49.880 align:middle line:84%
You feel that chill-- you
feel someone, as you have had,

00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:52.040 align:middle line:84%
touch your hair
or your shoulder.

00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:55.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most human beings, if
we're paying any attention,

00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:57.990 align:middle line:84%
are having these experiences
pretty regularly.

00:57:57.990 --> 00:58:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Is your thought that it's best
to just say, oh, interesting.

00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:01.880 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Goodbye.

00:58:02.590 --> 00:58:05.060 align:middle line:84%
To engage-- or how
do we begin exploring

00:58:05.060 --> 00:58:08.462 align:middle line:84%
our multi-dimensional
reality on a personal level?

00:58:08.462 --> 00:58:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:10.586 align:middle line:84%
Well funnily enough,
I'm on a case

00:58:10.586 --> 00:58:15.120 align:middle line:84%
just now from a lady who's been
troubled by both phenomena.

00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:18.820 align:middle line:84%
She's experiencing grays in
her bedroom, and ghosts-- would

00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:20.490 align:middle line:90%
you believe-- and spirit.

00:58:20.490 --> 00:58:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And she's absolutely
traumatized.

00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:24.100 align:middle line:90%
She's from Ireland.

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:27.137 align:middle line:84%
Her daughter,
Amanda, is terrified.

00:58:27.137 --> 00:58:28.970 align:middle line:84%
She has to bring her
daughter into the room,

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:32.460 align:middle line:84%
and there's this smokey mist
envelops the two of them.

00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, they see
this gray creature there.

00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And they've seen ghosts and
spirit in this room, as well.

00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:42.040 align:middle line:90%
So that is perplexing, as well.

00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's trying to
analyze that and what

00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:46.780 align:middle line:90%
we're dealing with here.

00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:49.050 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So I
guess everybody has

00:58:49.050 --> 00:58:52.200 align:middle line:10%
to approach it in their
own way, in the end?

00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yes.

00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:55.540 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
pooling the evidence--

00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:57.040 align:middle line:90%
getting that evidence out there.

00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Mainstream media,
as we spoke about,

00:58:58.930 --> 00:59:00.849 align:middle line:84%
are not up to probably
letting us do that.

00:59:00.849 --> 00:59:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:02.098 align:middle line:90%
We're on our own.

00:59:02.098 --> 00:59:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: But thankfully,
shows like yourself--

00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:06.690 align:middle line:84%
the wonderful TV show
that you're producing--

00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:08.760 align:middle line:90%
is getting that information out.

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:10.219 align:middle line:84%
And that needs to
come out, Regina.

00:59:10.219 --> 00:59:12.218 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Instead of just
being weird phenomena,

00:59:12.218 --> 00:59:13.990 align:middle line:84%
my interest in all
of it is that people

00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:17.840 align:middle line:84%
start looking at the
notion of realities

00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:19.930 align:middle line:84%
beyond this physical
reality, even

00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:21.930 align:middle line:84%
if it's another physical
reality from elsewhere,

00:59:21.930 --> 00:59:23.804 align:middle line:84%
but start getting
comfortable with the notion

00:59:23.804 --> 00:59:27.000 align:middle line:84%
that we've never been alone and
we're really only experiencing

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.099 align:middle line:84%
a tiny sliver of our
reality with our senses.

00:59:29.099 --> 00:59:29.890 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: We are.

00:59:29.890 --> 00:59:30.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:59:30.250 --> 00:59:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's start opening
up and seeing what's out there.

00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:33.531 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: We are.

00:59:33.531 --> 00:59:36.715 align:middle line:84%
We're a tiny, tiny grain of
sand in a huge cosmic beach.

00:59:36.715 --> 00:59:37.465 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You bet.

00:59:37.465 --> 00:59:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: Just tiny
bit-- grain of sand.

00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:41.410 align:middle line:90%
Just one quick story.

00:59:41.410 --> 00:59:43.160 align:middle line:84%
My father, when
he saw my interest

00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:46.100 align:middle line:84%
in these matters
developing, he says,

00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:47.600 align:middle line:84%
son, I've got
something to tell you.

00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:48.141 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what?

00:59:48.141 --> 00:59:48.980 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:52.694 align:middle line:84%
He sees, you know, your gran--
my mother-- I says yeah.

00:59:52.694 --> 00:59:53.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Grandmother.

00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:53.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:55.375 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: And,
well, she passed away,

00:59:55.375 --> 00:59:57.810 align:middle line:90%
as you know, last year.

00:59:57.810 --> 00:59:59.800 align:middle line:90%
You want to know what happened?

00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:00.810 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:02.530 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, she
had passed away.

01:00:02.530 --> 01:00:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And then the night after she had
passed, he was lying in his bed

01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:11.475 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, the room-- there
was a beautiful blue glow

01:00:11.475 --> 01:00:13.880 align:middle line:84%
of light pervaded
the whole room.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly,
he heard, Robert--

01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:19.425 align:middle line:84%
that's my father's name--
Robert, look at me.

01:00:19.425 --> 01:00:20.700 align:middle line:90%
Look at me.

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And my father knew that
that was his mother.

01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:28.226 align:middle line:90%
But she died the previous day.

01:00:28.226 --> 01:00:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And he pulled down the
covers and he looked at her.

01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:31.490 align:middle line:90%
And she was beautiful.

01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:32.270 align:middle line:90%
She was radiant.

01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:33.960 align:middle line:84%
She actually looked
30 years younger.

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:34.830 align:middle line:90%
And they say that with people.

01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I saw my mother
after she died-- same thing.

01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:38.140 align:middle line:84%
She looked about
40 years younger.

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:38.395 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

01:00:38.395 --> 01:00:39.436 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: It's
weird, isn't it?

01:00:39.436 --> 01:00:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

01:00:39.830 --> 01:00:42.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: And she says--
and it sounds Hollywood,

01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:45.420 align:middle line:84%
but this is what she said--
I'm just moving on now.

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:47.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to move on.

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.110 align:middle line:90%
I just want to say goodbye.

01:00:49.110 --> 01:00:50.590 align:middle line:90%
We will see each other again.

01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And with that, the
light diminished

01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:54.570 align:middle line:90%
and it was blackness again.

01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:57.600 align:middle line:84%
The following night, he learned
that his brother-- my Uncle

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.404 align:middle line:84%
Tommy-- they all-- she
had visited all the family

01:01:00.404 --> 01:01:01.070 align:middle line:90%
members, Regina.

01:01:01.070 --> 01:01:02.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:03.210 align:middle line:90%
Ooo.

01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:05.085 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBINSON: And just to
let her say farewell.

01:01:05.085 --> 01:01:08.800 align:middle line:84%
So life after death
for me is a given.

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.060 align:middle line:84%
Near death experiences--
out of body experiences--

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:14.330 align:middle line:84%
the phenomena-- the
evidence is there.

01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:15.650 align:middle line:90%
It's overwhelming.

01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's just-- it's a
fascination that drives me

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.950 align:middle line:84%
forward and I'm looking
for cases to build this.

01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we let our audience
know you're looking for cases.

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:25.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ROBINSON: Yes.

01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:25.650 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:01:25.650 --> 01:01:27.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that note,
I want to thank you

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:28.300 align:middle line:90%
so much for your time.

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:30.274 align:middle line:10%
And tell us what is
your website, again?

01:01:30.274 --> 01:01:32.190 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBINSON: Well, it's
a Facebook site I have.

01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:32.380 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:33.467 align:middle line:10%

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:42.152 align:middle line:90%
And that's the website.

01:01:42.152 --> 01:01:44.110 align:middle line:84%
If anybody wants to share
any of their stories,

01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:45.880 align:middle line:84%
it will be treated
in confidence.

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.487 align:middle line:90%
And I'd love to hear from you.

01:01:47.487 --> 01:01:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:48.850 align:middle line:90%
