>>REGINA MEREDITH:
I think most of us

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.630 align:middle line:84%
can agree that we're in shaky
times on the economic front.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.270 align:middle line:10%
To me, this is a magical
time of opportunity.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.270 align:middle line:10%
And our guest today, Charles
Eisenstein, might agree.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Charles is the author of
"Sacred Economy," where

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.920 align:middle line:84%
he takes a look at
how our society could

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.730 align:middle line:84%
be if we could move past
old expectations and habits,

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.370 align:middle line:84%
basically if we could
bust the old kind

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.420 align:middle line:84%
of patriarchal
paradigm of economics.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.220 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.095 align:middle line:84%
I've wanted to have you
on the show for years

00:00:45.095 --> 00:00:46.020 align:middle line:90%
because of that book.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARLES EISENSTEIN: Wow.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.478 align:middle line:90%
I'm really happy to be here.

00:00:47.478 --> 00:00:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
interesting, because now we're

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.480 align:middle line:90%
coming back around.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Here we have this little dip,
this little downturn in 2008,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.500 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And went back to our old
consumption patterns.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And here we are again, sitting
at the precipice of what

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.129 align:middle line:84%
almost every
economist in the world

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:84%
seems to believe is a looming
recession that could be worse

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.890 align:middle line:90%
than the last one.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So I thought it's time we
really do get creative.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.360 align:middle line:84%
It could be worse
than a recession.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.485 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, I know.

00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:16.670 align:middle line:90%
It could go into the D word.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.503 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:01:17.503 --> 00:01:19.730 align:middle line:10%
Because everybody knows
that the basic problems that

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.693 align:middle line:10%
caused the last recession
didn't really get solved.

00:01:22.693 --> 00:01:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were
swept under the rug

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.720 align:middle line:90%
and puffed up more artificially.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is-- oh, my god.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, I want to
let everybody get to know you.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.530 align:middle line:84%
This is your first
time on Gaia, right?

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: I think so.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.690 align:middle line:90%
I think so, too.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So let everybody get to
know you a little bit,

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.170 align:middle line:84%
because I was reading a recent
article you wrote, and I just--

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.570 align:middle line:84%
I loved it because you're
so candid and revealing

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.180 align:middle line:84%
about yourself, your inner
motivations, that you

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.430 align:middle line:84%
were kind of embarrassed
to share, and all of that.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And so let's just start this
part of our conversation,

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.660 align:middle line:84%
"get to know Charles" part
of the conversation when

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.410 align:middle line:84%
we go into the book
that you wrote,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.570 align:middle line:90%
called "The Ascent of Humanity."

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.730 align:middle line:10%
I guess it was a nice
intellectual heady thing

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.370 align:middle line:10%
that you thought was going to
bring some real understanding

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.055 align:middle line:10%
and enlightenment
to the world, right?

00:02:06.055 --> 00:02:08.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah, I
thought, just like in school,

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.720 align:middle line:84%
if you turn in the "A" paper,
then good things happen.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.860 align:middle line:10%
So I kind of thought that if I
wrote this 600-page book that

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.962 align:middle line:10%
had all the right answers in
it, then the world would change

00:02:18.962 --> 00:02:20.420 align:middle line:10%
and I would become
rich and famous.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.500 align:middle line:90%
That was the plan.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah,
that was the plan.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And so five months in, you had
sold five copies that month?

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.390 align:middle line:84%
The first month,
I sold 100 copies

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.310 align:middle line:90%
when all my friends bought it.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know that one.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.982 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Then the
next month it was like 10,

00:02:33.982 --> 00:02:36.110 align:middle line:90%
and the next month it was five.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it wasn't
setting the world on fire, OK,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.140 align:middle line:90%
but what were you starting to--

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.112 align:middle line:84%
what were you grappling
with inside yourself?

00:02:44.112 --> 00:02:45.695 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: As far
as the book goes?

00:02:45.695 --> 00:02:46.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: The motivation--

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.475 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your
reaction to the fact

00:02:48.475 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:84%
that people just weren't
picking up on it.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah,
I was dismayed.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And all those ambitions
kind of fell apart.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was faced with my
actual deeper motivations

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.440 align:middle line:84%
for wanting to devote
so many years of my life

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.770 align:middle line:84%
to write this book, which
was driven by a question I'd

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.930 align:middle line:90%
had for decades--

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.170 align:middle line:84%
what is the origin of the
wrongness in the world?

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Why, when I look at any
institution, any system

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.560 align:middle line:90%
of our culture, it's corrupt.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:90%
I had to know.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I-- and I thought many
other people must be having

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.580 align:middle line:84%
the same question, maybe not so
clearly articulated, but this--

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.430 align:middle line:84%
just looking around, people
are not wholeheartedly

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.010 align:middle line:90%
participating in normal.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.993 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:03:37.993 --> 00:03:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: So
I thought-- yeah,

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.800 align:middle line:84%
I thought that this book
would really strike a chord.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And when it didn't, I got
to examine my other motives,

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.420 align:middle line:90%
such as--

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you were out
to help humanity go deeper.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Well, that's
what I was telling myself.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.128 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:03:52.128 --> 00:03:53.607 align:middle line:90%
That was the cover story.

00:03:53.607 --> 00:03:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And that motive was
certainly there along

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:84%
with the motive of being a
success in my father's eyes,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.640 align:middle line:84%
becoming wealthy, becoming
a respected thought leader.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Like I had all of
these ego motives, too.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And when those didn't work
out, I was faced with, OK,

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.810 align:middle line:90%
why am I really doing this?

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And will I continue this
work even if I don't attain

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.365 align:middle line:90%
any of these other prizes?

00:04:18.365 --> 00:04:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's a big
one for a lot of people.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.948 align:middle line:84%
And there's always
a point at which

00:04:21.948 --> 00:04:25.020 align:middle line:84%
someone gets to see who
they are in that process.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.788 align:middle line:84%
And so you had a
unique experience

00:04:26.788 --> 00:04:27.830 align:middle line:90%
in that you had a vision.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:90%


00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.940 align:middle line:90%
Basically I was asked by a--

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you could
call it a spiritual entity,

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.765 align:middle line:84%
an angel-- some being
that basically said--

00:04:43.765 --> 00:04:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
didn't normally

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.140 align:middle line:90%
see these beings, right?

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: No.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.638 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to claim that
it was an actual visitation.

00:04:51.638 --> 00:04:52.438 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:52.438 --> 00:04:53.510 align:middle line:90%
But some presence--

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: But something--

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --came
and spoke with you.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: --was asking me
very clearly, what do you want?

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:90%
What do you choose?

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And what are you willing
to sacrifice in order

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.090 align:middle line:84%
to help create a
more beautiful world?

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Are you willing to sacrifice
wealth, fame, recognition?

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Would you be
willing-- if this was

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.160 align:middle line:84%
what it took to
change the world,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.920 align:middle line:84%
would you be willing to
get no credit at all?

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Have somebody else
get the credit

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.270 align:middle line:84%
and you die in obscurity,
and then someone else is

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.970 align:middle line:84%
celebrated for the thoughts
that you've developed?

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Are you willing
to pay that price?

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
very big question

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.070 align:middle line:90%
to confront your ego with.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.180 align:middle line:90%
Truly.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Because you really had
to dig inside yourself.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.785 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
because you ultimately--

00:05:36.785 --> 00:05:38.410 align:middle line:84%
tell the rest of the
conversation, what

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.270 align:middle line:90%
they said to you.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Well--

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We can
give you this, but.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah, well, it was
more of a hypothetical, like,

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.330 align:middle line:84%
are you willing to
make this payment?

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.740 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes, I am.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And did things change
overnight after that?

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.940 align:middle line:90%
Nope.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.570 align:middle line:90%
But over time, it--

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.320 align:middle line:84%
at least the story
that I'm telling myself

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.530 align:middle line:84%
is that because I was willing
to make that payment, to let

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.310 align:middle line:84%
go of those other goals,
the ground was then

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.520 align:middle line:84%
clear for the work
to actually fulfill

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.290 align:middle line:90%
its purpose and potential.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.665 align:middle line:84%
And I can't say that I'm famous
or anything, but at least I'm--

00:06:14.665 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
well-respected in your area.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.915 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: I'm
well-respected.

00:06:17.915 --> 00:06:18.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm able to do my work.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.178 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting enough support
from the world to do it.

00:06:21.178 --> 00:06:23.470 align:middle line:84%
But I think that this-- like,
I don't want to make this

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.090 align:middle line:84%
into this heroic
thing that I did,

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.530 align:middle line:84%
because I think everybody is
faced with choices like this,

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.030 align:middle line:90%
clarifying choices.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.370 align:middle line:84%
The universe is
generous in this way,

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.625 align:middle line:84%
that if you're
serving two masters,

00:06:35.625 --> 00:06:37.000 align:middle line:84%
you'll reach a
choice point where

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.115 align:middle line:84%
you get to decide which one
you're actually serving.

00:06:40.115 --> 00:06:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: And you get
to know yourself better.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.338 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
make your choice.

00:06:44.338 --> 00:06:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
to sleep with that.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.360 align:middle line:90%
What you said is so true.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you look around at
all the people in our lives,

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.978 align:middle line:84%
once you hit 30, 40, 50,
sometimes it takes till 60,

00:06:52.978 --> 00:06:54.520 align:middle line:84%
ultimately you see
that somewhere you

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.230 align:middle line:90%
made that decision.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And that can be soothing and
create peace in one's life,

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.460 align:middle line:84%
or it can kind of
be devastating,

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.200 align:middle line:84%
making you feel like you have
to somehow play catch-up, right?

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.250 align:middle line:84%
So when you realized you were
willing to make the sacrifice,

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.070 align:middle line:84%
how did you start
putting yourself

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.090 align:middle line:84%
in the world in a way to be
of service at that point?

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Well,
at that point,

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.810 align:middle line:84%
being almost completely
unknown, I basically

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.790 align:middle line:90%
said yes to every offer.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And in between, I was
working at a construction job

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.490 align:middle line:90%
to feed my children.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.047 align:middle line:90%
And eventually, I just--

00:07:33.047 --> 00:07:34.630 align:middle line:84%
you know, things
eventually picked up.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:38.300 align:middle line:84%
There was one breakthrough
after another after another.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like they were
lucky breaks in a way.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And that if I had been
on a different timeline,

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:50.220 align:middle line:84%
I could be completely unknown
and obscure to this day.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes I
read amazing books

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.030 align:middle line:84%
by people who are
totally unknown.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.106 align:middle line:84%
And then, like, I read
bestsellers, and I'm like,

00:07:57.106 --> 00:07:57.906 align:middle line:90%
you know--

00:07:57.906 --> 00:07:58.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How'd this happen?

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: --this
isn't as good.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:07:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:00.640 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not about merit.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.160 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it has
to do with timing.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And people who are
successful sometimes

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:12.190 align:middle line:84%
like to attribute their
success to their merit.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.140 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:18.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm much more of a
believer in fate, I guess.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.290 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And so you started coming
to the position that

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.910 align:middle line:84%
doing these great big works,
like your would-have-been

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.190 align:middle line:90%
best-selling book, right?

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:34.299 align:middle line:84%
And such really don't
carry any more weight

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:84%
than single acts of generosity,
kindness, compassion.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.620 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is a different
aspect of the ambition

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.809 align:middle line:84%
to write a bestseller,
or write something

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:47.230 align:middle line:84%
that sells hundreds of
thousands or millions of copies.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.570 align:middle line:84%
It's the idea that
that will have a bigger

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:55.810 align:middle line:84%
impact on the world than if I
only reach 1,000 people or 500

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:56.920 align:middle line:90%
people or one person.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or help a little
old lady across the street.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.070 align:middle line:84%
But in some
spiritual traditions,

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:08.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking especially of
Zen, the greatest teachers

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.980 align:middle line:84%
are often the ones who
had only one disciple,

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.380 align:middle line:84%
whereas the ones that
had hundreds or thousands

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:19.120 align:middle line:84%
are considered maybe not
quite at that top tier.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And because the understanding
is that the world does not

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.790 align:middle line:90%
work as we think it does.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Our meaning or the dominant
culture's idea of causality

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.210 align:middle line:84%
is basically
Newtonian, that says

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:84%
that something changes when
you exert a force on a mass.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Therefore the more
force that you

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:41.300 align:middle line:84%
have at your disposal,
the more powerful you are.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:45.670 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a lot of money,
a lot of military force,

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:47.920 align:middle line:84%
a big platform, a
loud voice, you're

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.900 align:middle line:84%
going to influence
a lot more people

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.030 align:middle line:84%
and change the world
in a bigger way

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:56.020 align:middle line:84%
than if you're operating
on a very small level, just

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.070 align:middle line:84%
within a family, just
working with one person,

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.770 align:middle line:84%
taking care of one little piece
of land, one little garden, one

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:03.700 align:middle line:90%
child.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.300 align:middle line:90%
That's not very important.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.940 align:middle line:84%
So the result is
everybody's competing

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.250 align:middle line:84%
with each other to be
important, competing with each

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:13.750 align:middle line:84%
other for market share, for
audience, for mailing list,

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.430 align:middle line:90%
for book sales, and so on.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And some of it is
personal ambition.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:18.200 align:middle line:90%
I want to be great.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.110 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of it is also
this indoctrination

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:27.200 align:middle line:84%
into a theory of change that
I think is actually obsolete.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.630 align:middle line:84%
When we consider morphic
resonance, which--

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Once you enter
the quantum field,

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.760 align:middle line:84%
then that one act
of generosity takes

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.380 align:middle line:84%
on a completely
different meaning

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.600 align:middle line:90%
and level of importance.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:37.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And explain that.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:39.230 align:middle line:90%
Talk about it.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah, and on
a 500-year timescale, who

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.160 align:middle line:84%
knows what the most
important thing that you

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.960 align:middle line:90%
did in your entire life is?

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.150 align:middle line:84%
So morphic resonance,
Rupert Sheldrake's theory,

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.660 align:middle line:84%
basically says that any change
that happens in one place

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.990 align:middle line:84%
creates a field of change so
that the same change begins

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.490 align:middle line:90%
happening elsewhere.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Any act of generosity,
any act of kindness

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.410 align:middle line:84%
creates a field of generosity
or kindness or compassion.

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Even if nobody
finds out about it

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.670 align:middle line:84%
because your video of your
generous act went viral.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's kind
of the opposite.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.260 align:middle line:84%
If you make a big
show of it, then

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.180 align:middle line:84%
what you're putting
out into the world

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.780 align:middle line:84%
is a competing for
attention rather than

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.610 align:middle line:90%
a pure act of generosity.

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:29.240 align:middle line:84%
So there's a kind of faith here
that trusts a causal matrix

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.577 align:middle line:90%
that we're not trained to see.

00:11:31.577 --> 00:11:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not saying, like, you
shouldn't do anything political

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.800 align:middle line:84%
or shouldn't do
anything practical.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's that we
can trust that we're

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.810 align:middle line:84%
going to be put in the
right place and respond.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a big
act or a small act,

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.420 align:middle line:84%
we can trust where that
act is coming from.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was a big
leap of faith for you.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.220 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I still--

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.370 align:middle line:84%
I can't say that I'm totally
free of that way of thinking.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, if I'm invited to
be on a podcast or something,

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.610 align:middle line:84%
and it has an
audience of a million,

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.317 align:middle line:84%
and another one has an
audience of 30, you know--

00:12:04.317 --> 00:12:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's like, hmm--

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --let's see if I
have a conflict of interest,

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:08.940 align:middle line:90%
which one am I going to do?

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:10.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: So, yeah,
I still am enculturated

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.820 align:middle line:84%
into that way of
thinking, but also there

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:21.110 align:middle line:84%
are the moments that there's
no way that this is ever

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:22.870 align:middle line:90%
going to go viral.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.040 align:middle line:84%
It's just me and
one person, and it

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.190 align:middle line:84%
might be a whole afternoon
in intimate conversation.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Or time with my dear
mother, who is not

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:36.900 align:middle line:84%
likely to be the
vehicle of my success.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.540 align:middle line:84%
But something in
me knows that this

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.340 align:middle line:84%
is the most important thing
I could be doing right now.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true value.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:42.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And we don't-- true value isn't
really part of our economic

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:47.157 align:middle line:90%
structure, for one.

00:12:47.157 --> 00:12:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Well, yeah, it's
totally invisible in economics.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:50.690 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:52.130 align:middle line:84%
You're not generating
goods and services

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:53.360 align:middle line:90%
by doing that kind of thing.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's an intrinsic
part of the balance

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.255 align:middle line:84%
to the whole
system, which we are

00:12:57.255 --> 00:12:58.550 align:middle line:90%
going to work our way toward.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:00.080 align:middle line:90%
But let's talk about this--

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.990 align:middle line:84%
should I take the
million versus 30?

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:05.450 align:middle line:90%
OK, so you ended up on "Oprah."

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:06.965 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yes.

00:13:06.965 --> 00:13:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you wrote a--

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.160 align:middle line:84%
tell us what inspired
Oprah to pick you up

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.230 align:middle line:90%
and put you on her show.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: It was an article
I wrote after the election.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of Trump.

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Of Trump, yeah.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.343 align:middle line:84%
Basically-- see if I
remember what I said.

00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I actually had
that paper somewhere.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.070 align:middle line:90%
I printed it off.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.710 align:middle line:84%
You said so many
wonderful things in it.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And it really was about kind
of the future trajectory

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:34.310 align:middle line:84%
we could expect once
Trump came into office,

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.190 align:middle line:90%
but it was on a meta scale.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:36.990 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, go ahead.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: I
think a lot of it

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.673 align:middle line:84%
was about political
polarization.

00:13:39.673 --> 00:13:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it was.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: And
how when I read

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.550 align:middle line:84%
liberal sites and
conservative sites,

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.710 align:middle line:84%
underneath the surface
of the different opinions

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.600 align:middle line:84%
was something in
common, which was

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.420 align:middle line:84%
the diagnosis of the problem
is those horrible people

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.440 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: And if we could
only overcome them and arouse

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:02.900 align:middle line:84%
as much indignation and outrage
to rally the troops, to win

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.620 align:middle line:84%
this war against evil, then the
world will be a better place.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.460 align:middle line:84%
That actually is the
template of dehumanization

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:14.630 align:middle line:84%
that is responsible for so many
of the problems in our world.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:18.710 align:middle line:84%
To dehumanize somebody is a
necessary step to exploit them.

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Racism is a form
of dehumanization.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Sexism is a form
of dehumanization.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Xenophobia, all
of these isms are

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:28.040 align:middle line:84%
a way of making a human
less than they really are.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with calling them
deplorable, or calling them--

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.637 align:middle line:90%
like, you're reducing them.

00:14:33.637 --> 00:14:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Or just thinking that
they're ignorant and stupid,

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.490 align:middle line:90%
and what's wrong with them.

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:42.688 align:middle line:84%
And that way of thinking
also applies to nature.

00:14:42.688 --> 00:14:44.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- you wouldn't
say dehumanization,

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.920 align:middle line:84%
but maybe desacralization-- to
reduce the unique sacred living

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.460 align:middle line:84%
beings of nature into
just board feet of lumber,

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:84%
sources of commodities,
resources--

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Instead of living families
of forests, you know?

00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:59.720 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And so the revolution
that we are in right now,

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.163 align:middle line:84%
if I can use such
a charged term--

00:15:04.163 --> 00:15:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think it's true.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: It's a
revolution in our perception

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:12.500 align:middle line:84%
so that we come to see the
world as alive, as a companion,

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.420 align:middle line:90%
as a sacred being.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.570 align:middle line:84%
To see the soil as a living
being that is sacred.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.190 align:middle line:90%
To see the forests that way.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.410 align:middle line:90%
To see all people that way.

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And imagine how different
our systems would be--

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.220 align:middle line:84%
our economic systems, our
technological systems--

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.505 align:middle line:84%
if we were in full relationship
to the sacredness of the world.

00:15:31.505 --> 00:15:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.320 align:middle line:90%
Even our political systems.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And while we're not talking
about politics directly,

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.960 align:middle line:84%
I did an experiment
recently on my own site,

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.360 align:middle line:90%
which is under my name.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And I invited a woman on who
has an opposing-- if I were--

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.560 align:middle line:84%
I would certainly
be cast in the lot

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.440 align:middle line:84%
of probably more liberal, more
progressive, but maybe a little

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.690 align:middle line:84%
anarchistic as
well, and so forth.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, we see debates
between these all the time.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And I invited her on
to say, you know what?

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:01.670 align:middle line:84%
You and I as women want
the same thing in the end.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.400 align:middle line:84%
We want to have the same kind
of communities, cultures,

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.260 align:middle line:90%
relationships with our family.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:11.390 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing this as a path,
and I'm seeing this as a path.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:13.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk and find
out where the bridge is.

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
have been watching these

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:17.690 align:middle line:84%
because of what you
just said-- there's

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.153 align:middle line:84%
something that's
beginning to rise

00:16:20.153 --> 00:16:21.320 align:middle line:90%
and it's helping understand.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.477 align:middle line:84%
You can't just keep pointing
fingers at the other person.

00:16:24.477 --> 00:16:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:26.893 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm much more
interested in what

00:16:26.893 --> 00:16:29.160 align:middle line:84%
are the secret agreements
that unite opposite sides.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:29.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Me too.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.918 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: And what
are we actually striving

00:16:31.918 --> 00:16:34.790 align:middle line:84%
for that might get
projected onto Trump

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.530 align:middle line:90%
or projected onto somebody.

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:38.960 align:middle line:84%
This idea-- like, as you
were describing that woman,

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.600 align:middle line:84%
I thought, yeah, it's the
intuition that what we need

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.810 align:middle line:84%
is something from outside
of normal to come in.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And that desire
could get projected

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.970 align:middle line:90%
onto any charismatic figure.

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It can.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I said to
her at the beginning,

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say this
straight up front.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.897 align:middle line:84%
I think that a
person like Trump,

00:16:54.897 --> 00:16:56.480 align:middle line:84%
which is happening
all over the world,

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.390 align:middle line:84%
had to enter the scene
in order to even create

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:03.480 align:middle line:84%
this kind of dialogue, this
kind of action-reaction.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.280 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.405 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah, it
certainly-- and he certainly

00:17:06.405 --> 00:17:09.140 align:middle line:84%
brought a lot of things to the
surface that would otherwise

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.220 align:middle line:90%
remain hidden.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:11.930 align:middle line:90%
And so this article--

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:13.640 align:middle line:84%
it was very beautifully
written, by the way.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.119 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Thank you.

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:14.919 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:14.919 --> 00:17:19.579 align:middle line:84%
And so your attempt was
to show us that enemies--

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:21.890 align:middle line:84%
the other guy with the
other point of view, A,

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.390 align:middle line:84%
we've got to stop
this enemy story.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:25.190 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah, because
it's based-- it's actually

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.610 align:middle line:90%
a false diagnosis.

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:31.400 align:middle line:84%
When you diagnose the problem
as being fundamentally caused

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.690 align:middle line:84%
by bad people, that's actually
a really infantile way

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:35.690 align:middle line:90%
of looking at the world.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:37.843 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: It's like
the superhero movie.

00:17:37.843 --> 00:17:40.310 align:middle line:84%
The problem is
caused by the Joker.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And the solution is,
you kill the Joker

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.430 align:middle line:90%
and the problem's gone.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's almost all
Hollywood action movies.

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is infantile.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:47.900 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.240 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to grow
out of that at about age 6.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Like my son, he's still
really into Darth Vader.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.758 align:middle line:84%
Really into the good guys
and the bad guys, you know.

00:17:54.758 --> 00:17:58.270 align:middle line:84%
But you're not supposed
to build a whole culture,

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.090 align:middle line:84%
a whole political system,
a whole medical system,

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.550 align:middle line:90%
a whole agricultural system--

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or educational system.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah, on
identifying the bad guy

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:08.780 align:middle line:90%
and destroying the bad guy.

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Because actually the world is
a lot more complex than that.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of what we
see as the bad guy

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.470 align:middle line:84%
is actually a symptom
of deeper conditions.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And by focusing on
the bad guy, you

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.540 align:middle line:90%
neglect the deeper conditions.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.740 align:middle line:84%
By focusing on the outbreak
of weeds in your field,

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.990 align:middle line:84%
you're not paying
attention and you kill them

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:31.730 align:middle line:90%
with Roundup or something.

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.460 align:middle line:84%
You're not paying attention to,
what are the soil conditions?

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.860 align:middle line:84%
What happened to
the soil ecology?

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.830 align:middle line:84%
What about the biodiversity
that would keep

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:41.760 align:middle line:90%
pest species under control?

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Like, none of that enters
into the conversation

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:48.410 align:middle line:84%
when you are so focused
on finding the nail

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:50.000 align:middle line:84%
that you can pound
with your hammer.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:51.340 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we are, as you say,

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:58.730 align:middle line:84%
systemically and with each other
on a social level right now--

00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:59.880 align:middle line:90%
a societal level, right?

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we've
got some work to do.

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:06.110 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot-- there's
a lot of coming together

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.640 align:middle line:84%
in new ways to chat and
such that has to happen.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.980 align:middle line:90%
So you shared this with Oprah.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.120 align:middle line:84%
But let's go back to
your own ambitions

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.425 align:middle line:84%
and the notion Oprah has
invited you on, you know.

00:19:14.425 --> 00:19:16.520 align:middle line:84%
You've tried working
through the ego stuff.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.160 align:middle line:90%
How did that work with you?

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah, I
mean, by that point,

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:26.390 align:middle line:84%
I had had enough kind of
false promises that I'm like,

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:29.760 align:middle line:84%
oh, finally I've
made the breakthrough

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and everything is
going to explode now.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.870 align:middle line:84%
So by that point, I had had
that happen enough times

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:39.290 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't really loading
too much expectation onto it.

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think her influence
isn't what it was in the '90s.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.902 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: So-- and
it definitely gave me

00:19:45.902 --> 00:19:47.360 align:middle line:84%
some more visibility,
but it wasn't

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.810 align:middle line:84%
like book sales exploding
through the roof or anything.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:51.500 align:middle line:90%
Like the old days.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.625 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: But I thought
it was also significant

00:19:53.625 --> 00:19:56.030 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of my work
has been very marginal.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:58.630 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't really gotten
into universities.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:03.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm very much a countercultural
intellectual, you could say.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And that was a brush with
the mainstream that I'm like,

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:09.990 align:middle line:90%
OK, I haven't changed.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:11.960 align:middle line:84%
It's not that I've
sold out and become

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.790 align:middle line:84%
more conventional
in my opinions,

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:19.940 align:middle line:84%
so why am I getting this
engagement with the mainstream?

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.493 align:middle line:84%
And maybe Oprah's not, like,
mainstream-mainstream, but--

00:20:22.493 --> 00:20:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Still
pretty mainstream.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:25.577 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: --pretty
mainstream, yeah.

00:20:25.577 --> 00:20:29.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, maybe that means
that the mainstream is shifting

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:31.380 align:middle line:84%
and that the ideas
that I represent

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.680 align:middle line:84%
are no longer so
alternative, so unthinkable,

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.440 align:middle line:90%
so outside of reality.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Because as the mainstream
reality frays around the edges

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.790 align:middle line:84%
and begins to dissolve,
and economic collapse

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:47.520 align:middle line:84%
is maybe part of this--
ecological collapse,

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.640 align:middle line:84%
the collapse of all of
our systems, the growing

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.470 align:middle line:84%
ineffectiveness of the medical
system, et cetera, et cetera.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:59.370 align:middle line:84%
As this dissolving progresses,
the people in the mainstream

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:00.853 align:middle line:84%
are really looking
to the outside.

00:21:00.853 --> 00:21:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was what one
of your articles talked about,

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:05.708 align:middle line:84%
is what happens on
the margins, right?

00:21:05.708 --> 00:21:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Explain that to everyone,
because I thought

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.852 align:middle line:90%
it was just so perfectly put.

00:21:09.852 --> 00:21:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Well, I'm not
quite sure what you mean,

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.400 align:middle line:90%
but I can say that--

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The things that were
on the margins start coming--

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: They
rush into the center--

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.875 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to center,
when these were really

00:21:19.875 --> 00:21:21.280 align:middle line:90%
marginal ideas once upon a time.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Once this is vacated with any
sense of stability, normalcy,

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:26.070 align:middle line:90%
or whatnot.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.270 align:middle line:84%
When the center
begins to collapse,

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:29.950 align:middle line:84%
the ensuing vacuum sucks in
the things that have been--

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:31.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The marginal
stuff starts--

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:31.530 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.915 align:middle line:84%
Like, you can even see
this happening already

00:21:33.915 --> 00:21:35.220 align:middle line:90%
with, like, acupuncture.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:38.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that used to be kooky,
like, left-wing nonsense,

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:39.650 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now your
HMO covers it.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:41.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.353 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:21:42.353 --> 00:21:45.632 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with
medicine and in food.

00:21:45.632 --> 00:21:47.340 align:middle line:84%
I think these are
where it really starts.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Farmers markets
and organic agriculture.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Organic
movement, yeah.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: So
I think that we're

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.570 align:middle line:84%
going to see this
progressing as the infirmity

00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:59.700 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of our
established systems

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.940 align:middle line:90%
becomes more and more evident.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree with that.

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:06.120 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk about
what you consider to be true

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.530 align:middle line:84%
value and some of
your heroes in life.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was a guy named
Roy Brubaker, as I recall,

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:12.840 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Was he a farmer?

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.880 align:middle line:84%
So-- and he's just
one of these--

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.832 align:middle line:84%
he's just an example of one
of the people who exemplify--

00:22:22.832 --> 00:22:24.540 align:middle line:84%
and he wasn't a close
friend or anything.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:27.207 align:middle line:84%
He's kind of a-- their family's
kind of friends with my family.

00:22:27.207 --> 00:22:29.040 align:middle line:84%
My brother's a farmer,
you know, and they're

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.160 align:middle line:90%
in the same circles.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.420 align:middle line:90%
And he's since passed away.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:36.300 align:middle line:84%
But he's just one
of those people

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.640 align:middle line:84%
that maybe you've
come across sometimes,

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.710 align:middle line:84%
too, who are just so
generous that it's

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:43.400 align:middle line:90%
almost painful to see them.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're almost
like an emissary

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.720 align:middle line:90%
from a different world.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: So he would--

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:53.310 align:middle line:84%
he had this really successful
thriving organic farm,

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.440 align:middle line:90%
and he had all these interns.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And you know, farmers
are very, very busy.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like he was
getting rich, you know.

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:02.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's busy and
trying to make ends meet.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:05.250 align:middle line:84%
But anytime-- like
there's all these stories.

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Anytime anybody would
call him, hey, I've

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:09.638 align:middle line:84%
got a problem with my
tractor, and he would

00:23:09.638 --> 00:23:10.930 align:middle line:90%
try to tell them how to fix it.

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And if he couldn't, he
would leave the farm,

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.470 align:middle line:84%
go to their farm and
spend his whole afternoon

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.030 align:middle line:90%
fixing their tractor.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:19.230 align:middle line:90%
No questions asked.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:21.450 align:middle line:84%
He would just do
that automatically.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And when his intern
left the farm

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.410 align:middle line:84%
to set up his own
farm and his own--

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's becoming--
in our current system would

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.717 align:middle line:90%
be considered a competitor.

00:23:32.717 --> 00:23:33.550 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:34.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And his own
subscription service,

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:36.210 align:middle line:90%
you know, vegetable, like--

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:37.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Like, Roy not
only gave him his blessing,

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:45.530 align:middle line:84%
but actually
publicized this guy who

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:48.120 align:middle line:84%
is a direct competitor
with himself.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.850 align:middle line:90%
And why would somebody do that?

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:51.750 align:middle line:84%
I really think
seriously about that.

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Why would somebody do that?

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Only if he's understanding
the world in a different way,

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:01.920 align:middle line:84%
understanding that more
for you is not less for me.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.080 align:middle line:84%
More for you is more for
me, because we're not

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.140 align:middle line:90%
really separate.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: That's how
it is in a gift culture.

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And the whole notion of nature
collaborating versus competing

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.670 align:middle line:90%
for its survival.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:18.470 align:middle line:84%
We have a very collaborative
system that we work--

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:21.690 align:middle line:84%
that we live on and that we're
interacting with all the time.

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:23.760 align:middle line:84%
But we've somehow
managed to corrupt it

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.360 align:middle line:84%
into this really ridiculous
system of competition, which

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:31.680 align:middle line:84%
has led us to an economy
that is so unhealthy.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.390 align:middle line:90%
I mean, if you--

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:36.210 align:middle line:84%
as I call it, kind of elites and
wingnuts really benefit from it

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:38.970 align:middle line:84%
and everybody else is left
with their little begging

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:40.380 align:middle line:90%
bowls out, trying to get by.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:41.760 align:middle line:90%
This is wrong.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Well,
two things to that.

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:47.070 align:middle line:84%
One is that not even the
elites and wingnuts actually

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.120 align:middle line:90%
benefit from it.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, not really.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.150 align:middle line:90%
The perception is that they do.

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:54.988 align:middle line:84%
And that's the tool they want to
use for winning in their game.

00:24:54.988 --> 00:24:57.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: OK, so it
does seem like the elites

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:58.400 align:middle line:90%
are the big winners.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And in the game as they
have constituted it,

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:05.320 align:middle line:90%
they are the winners.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:09.987 align:middle line:84%
But the question is, what
have they actually won?

00:25:09.987 --> 00:25:11.820 align:middle line:84%
So let me return to
competition a little bit

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.380 align:middle line:90%
and then go back to that.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not
that competition

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:16.680 align:middle line:90%
is nonexistent in nature.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.590 align:middle line:90%
There is competition in nature.

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:22.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's never the case that
if only one species would

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.557 align:middle line:84%
disappear, then all
of its competitors

00:25:24.557 --> 00:25:25.390 align:middle line:90%
would be better off.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:27.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a holistic
kind of competition.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.333 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:25:28.333 --> 00:25:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And so the well-being and
in nature and in ecology,

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:35.390 align:middle line:84%
the well-being of the whole
depends on the well-being

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:37.010 align:middle line:90%
of each of the parts.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:84%
If the wolves are sick
or the wolves disappear,

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:43.130 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't mean that the
deer are finally better off.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:45.750 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what it means is that
the deer population explodes.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:47.810 align:middle line:84%
They strip the understory
and they starve.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:53.840 align:middle line:10%
>>EISENSTEIN: So the motto
"more for you is more for me,

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.330 align:middle line:10%
your well-being
is my well-being,"

00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:00.740 align:middle line:10%
that is true in nature and it's
true in a gift economy, which

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.020 align:middle line:10%
was every economy
until recently.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Because in a gift
economy, you don't hoard.

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.480 align:middle line:84%
If you have more than
you need, you give it

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.220 align:middle line:90%
to those who are in need.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Not only because
you're altruistic,

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:14.540 align:middle line:84%
not only because you
love these people,

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:18.770 align:middle line:84%
but also because you know that
if you're very generous, then

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.830 align:middle line:84%
when you're in need, people
will take care of you, too.

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:24.205 align:middle line:84%
So generosity is like
your bank account.

00:26:24.205 --> 00:26:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
right now, you have

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:28.670 align:middle line:84%
to go through this
enormous leap of faith

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:31.880 align:middle line:84%
to break from the old paradigm
until you have some evidence

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.230 align:middle line:90%
that this is true.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:34.700 align:middle line:84%
That's the scary
part for people,

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's where
it usually stops.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Because our economic system
makes it true that more for you

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:40.460 align:middle line:90%
is less for me.

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Because you get
the job, I don't.

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.990 align:middle line:84%
You repay your loan, and
there's not enough money

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:46.550 align:middle line:90%
for me to repay my loan.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately it's grounded in
the debt-based money-creation

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:50.540 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: So anyway,
to go back to the elites,

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:84%
they might have a lot of money,
they might have their yacht,

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.410 align:middle line:84%
they might have
their private jet,

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:05.720 align:middle line:84%
but if you look at their
level of happiness--

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.080 align:middle line:84%
and this could be measured,
but also just intuitively--

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:15.320 align:middle line:84%
is this a happy person compared
to a villager in Gambia

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.450 align:middle line:90%
or Costa Rica?

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:20.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember people in
Belize living in tree houses,

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:24.020 align:middle line:84%
coming out with large
families, but freshly pressed

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.900 align:middle line:84%
and washed, the white
dresses and things,

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:30.590 align:middle line:84%
but giving you their
seat on the bus and such.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:31.990 align:middle line:90%
Just smiling.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:34.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, the generosity
of a culture that was so

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:36.867 align:middle line:90%
poor at the time I was there.

00:27:36.867 --> 00:27:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And they were not miserable
people because of that.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:40.700 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:40.900 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.483 align:middle line:84%
Probably more joyful than most
people that you ever meet here.

00:27:43.483 --> 00:27:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:45.570 align:middle line:90%
I would agree with that.

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah, like
dancing spontaneously.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.680 align:middle line:90%
Dancing in the streets.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.600 align:middle line:84%
So you visit a place like
that, and you're aware

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.960 align:middle line:84%
then of the poverty that
we've cast ourselves into,

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:01.040 align:middle line:84%
that material possessions
and status objects are

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.090 align:middle line:90%
a kind of compensation for--

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:07.310 align:middle line:84%
they're false wealth in
place of true wealth.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:10.165 align:middle line:84%
True wealth is to feel that
you're at home in the world,

00:28:10.165 --> 00:28:10.965 align:middle line:90%
that you belong.

00:28:10.965 --> 00:28:14.600 align:middle line:90%


00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.610 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of
security that doesn't

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:19.430 align:middle line:90%
depend on how much you control.

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And very few people
have that when

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:26.090 align:middle line:84%
your security depends on money
and a financial crisis could

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:27.110 align:middle line:90%
wipe it all out.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.940 align:middle line:90%
And then what do you have?

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.410 align:middle line:84%
If you live in a
traditional village,

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:33.370 align:middle line:84%
no matter what
happens, other people

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:34.620 align:middle line:90%
are going to take care of you.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Someone's
still growing a crop.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.090 align:middle line:84%
There's someone that
can still fix the fence.

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:38.915 align:middle line:90%
There's still a baker.

00:28:38.915 --> 00:28:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And you've seen that
your whole life.

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:41.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:43.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's more than that.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.860 align:middle line:84%
Also you know who you
are, because you're

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:48.680 align:middle line:84%
enmeshed in a web of
stories and relationships

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:52.910 align:middle line:84%
rather than interacting
with distant strangers

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:54.445 align:middle line:90%
to meet all of your needs.

00:28:54.445 --> 00:28:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
true, and I just

00:28:55.820 --> 00:29:00.740 align:middle line:84%
want to bring-- this is from
a film about J. Paul Getty

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.990 align:middle line:84%
and the kidnapping
of his grandson.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And there was just this
pathetic moment when--

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:10.010 align:middle line:84%
I've forgotten who was
inquiring at the time,

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:12.890 align:middle line:84%
whether it was the person that
was negotiating the hostage

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:14.280 align:middle line:90%
agreement--

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.030 align:middle line:84%
who actually I knew in
real life, that person--

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:21.380 align:middle line:84%
is asking him, how
much is enough?

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Because he would not let go of
the money to get his grandson.

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And here he had just
essentially palaces full

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:33.800 align:middle line:84%
of ancient artifacts and
rugs, and stingily washing

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:37.070 align:middle line:84%
his little underwear out
by hand and hanging it

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:40.430 align:middle line:84%
in his little palatial room,
the one room that he lived in.

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:42.950 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what is up with
that kind of psychology?

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:44.390 align:middle line:90%
A lonely person.

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And the answer was, there
is no such thing as enough.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.847 align:middle line:90%
There's never enough.

00:29:47.847 --> 00:29:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:49.980 align:middle line:90%
Never enough.

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That has to be one
of the saddest statements I

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:56.325 align:middle line:90%
think I've ever heard.

00:29:56.325 --> 00:29:58.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: It's the
same as any addiction.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: The addiction
doesn't meet the real need,

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:04.940 align:middle line:90%
therefore no amount is enough.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And when it's in economic
terms, we call it greed.

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And then we activate the
same bad guy mentality.

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:16.700 align:middle line:84%
The problem is those
greedy executives,

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.760 align:middle line:84%
those greedy bankers,
those greedy investors.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.990 align:middle line:84%
If only we could conquer greedy
people and conquer greed,

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:25.520 align:middle line:90%
then everything would be fine.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:29.870 align:middle line:84%
But their greed is a symptom
of a profound dispossession.

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:32.780 align:middle line:84%
A dispossession of
community, of relationship,

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:35.730 align:middle line:90%
of belonging in the world.

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And as long as that remains, if
we destroy the greedy people,

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:44.455 align:middle line:84%
there'll be an endless
supply of new greedy people.

00:30:44.455 --> 00:30:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
because our system

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:48.600 align:middle line:90%
is based on that ourselves.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:54.050 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I'm more
interested in uncovering

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:57.620 align:middle line:84%
and healing the conditions
that give rise to the things

00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:59.415 align:middle line:90%
that we judge and condemn.

00:30:59.415 --> 00:31:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm
attracted to your work,

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.850 align:middle line:84%
is because you state things
so beautifully and so clearly.

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:08.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
a gift economy looks like.

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:11.090 align:middle line:84%
How do you reinstitute
a gift economy

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:13.795 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of this
really messed up system?

00:31:13.795 --> 00:31:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk
about what happens

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:20.450 align:middle line:84%
and what the potential is
in this potential or likely

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:23.240 align:middle line:84%
recession that could lead
to a depression, a really

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.860 align:middle line:84%
kind of world-changing
depression

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.352 align:middle line:84%
where the ships
stop shipping stuff.

00:31:28.352 --> 00:31:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: So I'll
just say right out,

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:32.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to
transition to a gift

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:33.680 align:middle line:90%
economy on a mass scale.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.270 align:middle line:90%
It's never happened before.

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:37.645 align:middle line:84%
Gift economies have always
been on a small scale, where--

00:31:37.645 --> 00:31:39.645 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's just keep
it to the small scale,

00:31:39.645 --> 00:31:41.180 align:middle line:84%
because that we
can manage anyway.

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Then we can choose to be in
a place where we can do this.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Well,
I mean, certainly we

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:50.210 align:middle line:84%
can reclaim some of our
lives from the system

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:53.768 align:middle line:84%
of mass production and the
global division of labor,

00:31:53.768 --> 00:31:55.310 align:middle line:84%
but we can't reclaim
all of our lives

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:57.410 align:middle line:84%
from that, unless you want
to go live in an ecovillage

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:59.260 align:middle line:84%
somewhere and be
self-sufficient and so forth.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:31:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.025 align:middle line:84%
You're going to buy
a toothbrush that's

00:32:01.025 --> 00:32:02.233 align:middle line:90%
probably made somewhere else.

00:32:02.233 --> 00:32:03.608 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN:
Probably, or a cell

00:32:03.608 --> 00:32:05.840 align:middle line:84%
phone that requires a global
coordination of labor.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:06.753 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:32:06.753 --> 00:32:07.670 align:middle line:90%
That's not going away.

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: There are
people who don't do that,

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:11.120 align:middle line:84%
but that's not a
realistic prescription,

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.880 align:middle line:84%
for 8 billion people to all
go back to that right now.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:18.300 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the more
interesting question is,

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.260 align:middle line:84%
how do we bring some of
the principles and spirit

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:28.040 align:middle line:84%
of gift economy to the mass
economy, the money economy?

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And in "Sacred Economics" I
go into some of the proposals.

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:35.840 align:middle line:84%
One of them is to change
the way that money

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:42.602 align:middle line:84%
is created and distributed away
from interest-bearing debt.

00:32:42.602 --> 00:32:44.060 align:middle line:84%
To explain that
right now, I'd have

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.980 align:middle line:84%
to kind of outline the
whole money creation system

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:48.630 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:54.980 align:middle line:84%
So I will say is, basically
the key insight is that money

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:57.560 align:middle line:90%
is actually just a story.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Money is just an agreement
among human beings

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:02.540 align:middle line:90%
that assigns value to symbols.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:05.130 align:middle line:90%
And that story can be changed.

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:07.550 align:middle line:84%
The story that we have
now gives the power

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:09.770 align:middle line:84%
to create money to
certain entities

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:11.270 align:middle line:90%
under certain conditions.

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:12.860 align:middle line:90%
They're called banks.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:16.460 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we have a system where
money is lent into existence

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.130 align:middle line:84%
as interest-bearing debt,
meaning that there is always

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:21.320 align:middle line:90%
more debt than there is money.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.450 align:middle line:90%
Meaning that we're always--

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Scarcity.

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Scarcity,
competition, anxiety,

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:26.990 align:middle line:90%
and endless growth.

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:28.805 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's so sick.

00:33:28.805 --> 00:33:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: And it's
built into the system.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's a set of agreements.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.460 align:middle line:90%
And agreements can be changed.

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.560 align:middle line:84%
We talk about $20 trillion
of debt for the United States

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.360 align:middle line:90%
government.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.100 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is that actually?

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.770 align:middle line:90%
That's only bits in computers.

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And that could change with a
change in our social agreements

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.950 align:middle line:90%
and political agreements.

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:50.970 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is written in stone.

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:54.440 align:middle line:84%
So as humanity and
as civilization,

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.800 align:middle line:84%
as our society transitions
into a different story that's

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:02.090 align:middle line:84%
not about a separate self
in a world of other seeking

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:04.280 align:middle line:84%
to outcompete all
the rest of life

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.550 align:middle line:84%
to come to a triumphant
domination of the planet,

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:09.889 align:middle line:84%
but instead a story
of interconnection,

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:13.489 align:middle line:84%
interdependency, ecology,
interbeingness, compassion,

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:16.130 align:middle line:84%
and empathy, then
the story of money,

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:21.260 align:middle line:84%
which fit perfectly into that
old story, no longer fits.

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:24.650 align:middle line:84%
It no longer resonates with
the emerging consciousness

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:25.760 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.030 align:middle line:84%
So the question, then, that
I investigate in the book

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:34.130 align:middle line:84%
is, what system of money would
resonate with the emerging

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:38.780 align:middle line:84%
values of cooperation,
symbiosis, ecology, sharing,

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.010 align:middle line:90%
generosity?

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:43.460 align:middle line:84%
What would money look like
that didn't reward hoarding?

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:47.870 align:middle line:84%
If you kept it, its value
declines rather than increases

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:49.370 align:middle line:90%
because of interest.

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:53.094 align:middle line:84%
What would it look like if you
weren't forced to make money

00:34:53.094 --> 00:34:54.469 align:middle line:84%
in order to make
a living, if you

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:56.360 align:middle line:90%
had a universal basic income?

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.300 align:middle line:84%
So I go into really
nuts-and-bolts

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:00.665 align:middle line:90%
economic questions like that.

00:35:00.665 --> 00:35:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I want to
get into some of them

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:04.010 align:middle line:84%
so people can start
contemplating.

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Because here we're
looking at a time

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:09.410 align:middle line:84%
where we have this disruption
in our current economic picture

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:11.030 align:middle line:90%
coming up most likely.

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And our parents,
depending on how old

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:17.630 align:middle line:84%
you are, or grandparents went
through this in the Depression.

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And they had to learn
to collaborate again

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:21.030 align:middle line:90%
because there was nothing.

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:22.010 align:middle line:90%
There was no food.

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:23.150 align:middle line:90%
There was no money.

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:26.085 align:middle line:84%
People did-- they were
living in extended family.

00:35:26.085 --> 00:35:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, we
were almost living

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:30.410 align:middle line:84%
in more of a gift economy,
gifting economy out

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:31.773 align:middle line:90%
of necessity.

00:35:31.773 --> 00:35:33.190 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, then
that gave birth

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:36.000 align:middle line:84%
to the next generation,
which was told, you save.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And by the time you
were in second grade,

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.310 align:middle line:84%
you had a little
passbook that you

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:43.380 align:middle line:84%
put your quarters in that went
in once a week to the bank,

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:44.180 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.263 align:middle line:84%
So you started your savings
account when you were,

00:35:46.263 --> 00:35:47.870 align:middle line:90%
what, seven or eight years old.

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:51.022 align:middle line:84%
And the holy grail was to
have a "savings account."

00:35:51.022 --> 00:35:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: And
financial independence.

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:53.165 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And financial
independence--

00:35:53.165 --> 00:35:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: I mean,
that's what it becomes.

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --so you don't have to
live with your extended family

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:56.840 align:middle line:90%
and your old grandpa anymore.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN:
Financial independence

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:58.640 align:middle line:90%
means you don't need anybody.

00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You need anybody.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: I don't
need anybody's gifts.

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.120 align:middle line:90%
I can take care of it myself.

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.912 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
the boomer generation,

00:36:03.912 --> 00:36:05.690 align:middle line:90%
going into the Xer generation.

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:07.543 align:middle line:90%
Now we have something new.

00:36:07.543 --> 00:36:08.960 align:middle line:84%
People aren't
making enough money.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.270 align:middle line:84%
There isn't enough money to
buy a house in most places

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:14.030 align:middle line:84%
in this country
anymore on a normal job

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:15.950 align:middle line:90%
or a one-income family.

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:18.560 align:middle line:84%
So now, it seems,
by necessity we're

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:23.860 align:middle line:84%
going to have to go back into
some kind of other economy,

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:26.970 align:middle line:84%
some kind of, you call
it gifting economy.

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:29.592 align:middle line:84%
What does that look like now
for the millennials and younger?

00:36:29.592 --> 00:36:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Well,
gifting economy really just

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:32.698 align:middle line:90%
means community.

00:36:32.698 --> 00:36:35.240 align:middle line:84%
It means that you take care of
each other without being paid.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.160 align:middle line:84%
It means you help your
neighbor fix their roof.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.940 align:middle line:84%
It means you share the
vegetables from your garden.

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:40.702 align:middle line:84%
It means you help watch
each other's kids.

00:36:40.702 --> 00:36:41.660 align:middle line:90%
All that kind of stuff.

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:42.640 align:middle line:90%
That's community.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: And when it
gets replaced by contractors,

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:53.750 align:middle line:84%
by insurance to help you fix
your house, by paid child care,

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:57.232 align:middle line:84%
then the economy grows, but
you no longer have community.

00:36:57.232 --> 00:36:58.940 align:middle line:84%
The difference between
now and the '30s--

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you have a lot
more stress on the individual.

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.530 align:middle line:90%
And everything depends on money.

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:07.620 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you have a really
well-connected community,

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:08.420 align:middle line:90%
you don't--

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.168 align:middle line:84%
if you lose your income,
you don't lose everything

00:37:11.168 --> 00:37:12.710 align:middle line:84%
because you still
have people around.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And you've probably been
helping them for years,

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.890 align:middle line:84%
for decades, so they'll
take care of you, too.

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.472 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: The difference
between today and the '30s

00:37:22.472 --> 00:37:25.460 align:middle line:84%
is that we don't have those
strongly-knit communities

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:26.550 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:29.878 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't even know
their neighbors very well.

00:37:29.878 --> 00:37:31.420 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
anybody they can call

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.590 align:middle line:90%
an emergency who lives nearby.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:38.000 align:middle line:84%
So I think you're right that
an economic breakdown could

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.270 align:middle line:84%
encourage people to
re-forge those ties.

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:44.570 align:middle line:84%
But many of the habits of
community have languished.

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:47.480 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's still
fundamental to human nature.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.490 align:middle line:84%
We see it when there's
a natural disaster.

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:52.880 align:middle line:84%
It automatically
rises to the surface.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one of the gifts
that an economic breakdown

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:57.890 align:middle line:90%
could bring us.

00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:03.230 align:middle line:84%
But that's not to excuse the
necessity for some systems

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:05.630 align:middle line:84%
change, which I
think would really

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:08.188 align:middle line:84%
start with debt relief
or debt cancellation.

00:38:08.188 --> 00:38:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, let's talk about
some of the basic principles

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:12.890 align:middle line:84%
so we can kind of
start thinking about it

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.750 align:middle line:90%
and lobbying toward that.

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: I mean, this would
require a complicated lecture,

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:21.800 align:middle line:84%
but I can simplify
one thing which will

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.870 align:middle line:90%
resonate with your intuition.

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Which is that in 2008,
there was a bailout, right?

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:29.667 align:middle line:90%
Who got bailed out?

00:38:29.667 --> 00:38:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The banks.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: The banks--

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not the students
with the debt load.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.605 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: That's right.

00:38:33.605 --> 00:38:35.540 align:middle line:84%
The insurance companies,
they got bailed out.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.230 align:middle line:90%
The investors got bailed out.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:38.030 align:middle line:90%
They were fined.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then we nailed
the students with debts.

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yep.

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:42.488 align:middle line:84%
The students didn't
get bailed out.

00:38:42.488 --> 00:38:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Homeowners didn't
get bailed out.

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:46.730 align:middle line:84%
People with credit card
debt didn't get bailed out.

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:48.890 align:middle line:84%
The next bailout shouldn't
be a creditors' bailout.

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:50.325 align:middle line:84%
It should be a
debtors' bailout--

00:38:50.325 --> 00:38:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: --where basically
the Federal Reserve buys up all

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:59.650 align:middle line:84%
of these troubled debts and
either cancels them completely

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:03.230 align:middle line:84%
in a debt jubilee, which has
historical precedent going back

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:04.110 align:middle line:90%
to biblical times--

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, let's talk
about a couple of debt

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:06.950 align:middle line:90%
jubilees even in recent times.

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:08.155 align:middle line:90%
I want to hear about this.

00:39:08.155 --> 00:39:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN:
Well, let me just--

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
finish your statement,

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:11.680 align:middle line:90%
then give us a couple examples.

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Or it could reduce
the interest rates to zero,

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:14.840 align:middle line:90%
or even negative.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.990 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Anything is
possible because, again, debt

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:22.310 align:middle line:90%
is an agreement.

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:24.620 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: It's a social
and political agreement.

00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:26.828 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't think the
people would stand for it

00:39:26.828 --> 00:39:29.840 align:middle line:84%
if once again those same
entities got a second bailout

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.540 align:middle line:84%
and everyone else is left
holding the bag, only worse--

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:33.500 align:middle line:90%
worse off than before.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: I would like
people not to stand for it.

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I hope they don't.

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: And
to help them not

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.750 align:middle line:84%
stand for it, we can say
that there is an alternative.

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: One
reason people stand

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.735 align:middle line:84%
for it is that they don't know
that there's any other way

00:39:43.735 --> 00:39:45.080 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.450 align:middle line:84%
But when we understand
that you're not

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:50.240 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be in hopeless
debt your whole life.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And if you are, it's not
because you're a bad person.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:56.300 align:middle line:84%
It's because the system is
stacked to require that.

00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:00.770 align:middle line:84%
In the 1960s, public education
was higher education.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:02.250 align:middle line:90%
Universities were nearly free.

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:03.470 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: You could
work a part-time job

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:05.470 align:middle line:90%
and pay for your education.

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now Bernie
Sanders, if he brings it up,

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:09.110 align:middle line:84%
is called a communist,
because people

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:11.420 align:middle line:84%
don't know what socialism,
democratic socialism

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:12.380 align:middle line:90%
even means.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.297 align:middle line:84%
And so it's taking on
this whole other flavor.

00:40:14.297 --> 00:40:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:16.940 align:middle line:84%
But it used to be like that,
like under Eisenhower--

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:17.575 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:40:17.575 --> 00:40:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: --in the '50s.

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:19.280 align:middle line:90%
Eisenhower wasn't a communist.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Exactly.

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:24.340 align:middle line:84%
It is funny how the story
keeps being kind of bastardized

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:25.960 align:middle line:90%
in the mainstream media.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.880 align:middle line:90%
But yes, that's true.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.967 align:middle line:90%
That was available.

00:40:28.967 --> 00:40:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And so that's just to say that
the debt that is oppressing

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:38.170 align:middle line:90%
everybody is illegitimate.

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:40.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not legitimate
debt if you're forced

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.410 align:middle line:90%
to go into debt just to live.

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:42.493 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is so true.

00:40:42.493 --> 00:40:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: That
is called feudalism.

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:46.120 align:middle line:90%
That is called debt peonage.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:49.960 align:middle line:84%
A debt peon is somebody
who has to serve

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.160 align:middle line:90%
his debts his entire life.

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.870 align:middle line:84%
He's controlled by his
masters through debt.

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And when people understand
that that is illegitimate,

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:04.570 align:middle line:84%
then the political will will
arise to change the system.

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:09.490 align:middle line:84%
So before we go on to another
kind of functional shift

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:13.120 align:middle line:84%
in reality we could choose,
let's talk about debt jubilee.

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I think when people hear
that, it's like, debt jubilee?

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:18.870 align:middle line:90%
What a wonderful concept.

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:21.550 align:middle line:84%
The first thing you
sense is freedom in that.

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:24.430 align:middle line:84%
So are there examples-- you said
there are examples historically

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:25.660 align:middle line:90%
where this has occurred.

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's
mentioned in the Bible.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:32.110 align:middle line:84%
There was a big debt
jubilee in ancient Athens,

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:34.810 align:middle line:84%
because what was
happening is more and more

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:37.720 align:middle line:84%
citizens were going into
debt, losing their land,

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.880 align:middle line:84%
losing their families,
losing themselves.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.910 align:middle line:84%
They would become slaves if
they couldn't pay their debt.

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:44.640 align:middle line:90%
And it was harming--

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:50.050 align:middle line:84%
it was causing social unrest and
reducing the base of citizens

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:52.955 align:middle line:84%
to fewer and fewer who
were the only ones allowed

00:41:52.955 --> 00:41:53.830 align:middle line:90%
to serve in the army.

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:55.705 align:middle line:84%
You had to be a citizen
to serve in the army,

00:41:55.705 --> 00:41:57.100 align:middle line:90%
so it was weakening the state.

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And there was all this
political pressure.

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:01.570 align:middle line:84%
So Solon, the
great leader Solon,

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:04.750 align:middle line:84%
whose name is synonymous
with wisdom today,

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:08.860 align:middle line:84%
he took power and
instituted a debt jubilee.

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:12.280 align:middle line:84%
He canceled the debts,
restored the lands,

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:15.850 align:middle line:84%
and gave rise to
classical Athens

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:20.420 align:middle line:84%
as one of the golden
ages of human history.

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:21.220 align:middle line:90%
So that's--

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:23.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's such
a beautiful thought.

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:26.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and everyone can
feel the relief and freedom

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and kind of veracity
in the value of that.

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.420 align:middle line:90%
And so-- I mean, I love it.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:34.253 align:middle line:90%
Is there an actual--

00:42:34.253 --> 00:42:35.628 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we know
people, there are

00:42:35.628 --> 00:42:37.900 align:middle line:84%
people kind of fighting on
this student debt thing.

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:41.180 align:middle line:84%
But is there a debt
jubilee movement itself?

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:41.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:42.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:45.180 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you see it
mentioned sometimes.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:47.100 align:middle line:84%
If you do an internet
search on it,

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:48.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you'll find
a lot of information.

00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:49.730 align:middle line:90%
It is a thing now.

00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it is a thing.

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:50.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So people can plug in and put
some energy there if they wish.

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: And I think it
also resonates with emerging

00:42:57.490 --> 00:43:00.430 align:middle line:84%
spiritual values
and understandings,

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:03.510 align:middle line:90%
such as that you don't--

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:05.430 align:middle line:90%
the value of forgiveness.

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:09.700 align:middle line:90%
A debt is a kind of a--

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:12.280 align:middle line:84%
it's analogous to a
resentment that you

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.530 align:middle line:90%
hold to another person.

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately you
realize you don't

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:20.200 align:middle line:84%
want to hold them forever
in a kind of servitude

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.160 align:middle line:90%
to your resentment.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:23.080 align:middle line:90%
You want to let go of it.

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.360 align:middle line:84%
So forgiveness is also
a kind of a generosity.

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:26.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a gift.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.015 align:middle line:90%
So I think that this is--

00:43:29.015 --> 00:43:31.220 align:middle line:84%
like, we're talking
about economics here,

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:36.880 align:middle line:84%
but our economic system
will not significantly

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:42.220 align:middle line:84%
change except as part
of a larger change,

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:47.080 align:middle line:84%
as part of a social,
psychological, spiritual

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.190 align:middle line:90%
change.

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:50.590 align:middle line:84%
We are-- because
the money system,

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:52.390 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned
before, it's totally

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:56.230 align:middle line:84%
aligned with the values
of competition and growth

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:57.580 align:middle line:90%
and domination.

00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:01.240 align:middle line:84%
As those values change,
the economic system

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.740 align:middle line:90%
can change with it.

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And as the economic
system changes,

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:06.340 align:middle line:90%
it nourishes different values.

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you live in a gift
economy and every single day

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:13.840 align:middle line:84%
you see that the most generous
person is the most honored,

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:18.070 align:middle line:84%
then you don't need
to hold onto things.

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And teachings like
the Golden Rule,

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:23.205 align:middle line:90%
as you do unto others so--

00:44:23.205 --> 00:44:25.330 align:middle line:84%
do unto others as you would
have them do unto you--

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As you would
have them do unto you.

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:26.470 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: --gets flipped
into, as you do unto others,

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:30.180 align:middle line:90%
so they do unto you.

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.930 align:middle line:84%
As you do unto others,
so you are actually

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:33.430 align:middle line:90%
doing unto yourself.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:34.990 align:middle line:84%
That's obvious in
a gift economy,

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:37.438 align:middle line:84%
because you give to
somebody and they have more,

00:44:37.438 --> 00:44:39.730 align:middle line:84%
so they give to somebody
else, and they are doing well,

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:40.980 align:middle line:90%
so they give to somebody else.

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:43.420 align:middle line:90%
And it circles back to you.

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Karma is obvious
in a gift economy.

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think, for me-- one area
I did some stories on a while

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.310 align:middle line:90%
back, over a decade ago--

00:44:54.310 --> 00:44:58.510 align:middle line:84%
I really like and appreciate
is the notion of time banking,

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:00.220 align:middle line:84%
or you can call
it something else.

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.800 align:middle line:84%
I find that really
very doable place

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:06.100 align:middle line:84%
to start, especially in
smaller local economies

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:08.590 align:middle line:84%
or even within
neighborhoods or some group

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:09.730 align:middle line:90%
structure of some kind.

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:12.250 align:middle line:84%
You can start time
banking-- if you

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:15.940 align:middle line:84%
go to church-- within a church,
and the membership of a church,

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:18.360 align:middle line:90%
or a small town.

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:19.650 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about the value.

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.810 align:middle line:84%
Is that is that part of
what you see as something--

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: I think so.

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that
could come forward?

00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: You know, yeah,
I mean, so time banking,

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.675 align:middle line:84%
basically everybody's time
is equal and so if you--

00:45:27.675 --> 00:45:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: An hour is
an hour, if it's--

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: An hour's an hour.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.567 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --an apple
pie or a legal contract.

00:45:31.567 --> 00:45:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.450 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it
can help to rebuild

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:40.038 align:middle line:84%
some of these reciprocal
relationships in community.

00:45:40.038 --> 00:45:41.580 align:middle line:84%
There's also the
risk that it ends up

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.220 align:middle line:84%
quantifying things that in
a really healthy community

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:45.690 align:middle line:90%
aren't quantified.

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us
what you mean by that.

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: So
in time banking,

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:51.870 align:middle line:84%
if you babysit the
neighbors' kids,

00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:54.030 align:middle line:84%
say, then you get--
you know, for two hours

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:57.430 align:middle line:84%
you get two time dollars,
or whatever you call them.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:59.228 align:middle line:84%
And if you do a
lot of that, you're

00:45:59.228 --> 00:46:01.020 align:middle line:84%
going to get lots and
lots of time dollars.

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And then you can spend
them on lawn care.

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Somebody will mow your lawn,
or something like that.

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:13.032 align:middle line:84%
But quantifying things,
something's always left out.

00:46:13.032 --> 00:46:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
talk about how that

00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:16.290 align:middle line:90%
leads to quantifying things.

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:19.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you might say,
it's easy for maybe a woman

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:21.330 align:middle line:84%
or a grandmother to watch
a child for six hours,

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:24.460 align:middle line:84%
not so easy to drop six
hours of legal documents.

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:27.510 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Or
maybe you understand.

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:29.250 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in a
community and you

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:31.620 align:middle line:84%
are familiar with
each other's lives

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:34.050 align:middle line:84%
and you're talking
about each other,

00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:38.910 align:middle line:84%
then you might know that
so-and-so's babysitting

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:42.963 align:middle line:84%
contribution was actually like
a huge sacrifice for them.

00:46:42.963 --> 00:46:44.380 align:middle line:84%
They really went
out of their way.

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:47.010 align:middle line:84%
They had to-- like, you know
who's actually generous.

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: And
when you try to--

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:51.530 align:middle line:90%
it's a qualitative thing.

00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:55.760 align:middle line:84%
It's based on all kinds
of subtle relationships.

00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And so reducing that
to just some numbers,

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.340 align:middle line:90%
it ends up wiping out--

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I see
what you're saying.

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:03.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: And this
is part of our whole--

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.820 align:middle line:84%
it's not just-- our
whole society is geared

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:11.550 align:middle line:90%
toward thinking quantitatively.

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:14.860 align:middle line:84%
It's related to the "find
the enemy" mentality.

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:15.660 align:middle line:90%
It's find--

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I see
what you're saying.

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Find the quantity to increase
or reduce to make the world

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:21.270 align:middle line:90%
a better place.

00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:23.150 align:middle line:90%
GDP is that.

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:25.380 align:middle line:84%
If we only raise
GDP, it is thought,

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:27.070 align:middle line:90%
everybody would be better off.

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:28.770 align:middle line:84%
But what's happening
is that we are

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:31.350 align:middle line:84%
converting a
multiplicity of values

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:33.550 align:middle line:84%
into a single
thing called value.

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that,
the unquantitative,

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:39.180 align:middle line:90%
the qualitative is lost.

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And we can see we
live in a society

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:44.300 align:middle line:84%
right now that has more and more
and more of the quantitative,

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:46.620 align:middle line:90%
of the things you can measure.

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Twice as much floor
space per capita

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:54.435 align:middle line:84%
as in the '60s, but less
and less of the qualitative,

00:47:54.435 --> 00:47:56.090 align:middle line:84%
the things that
we can't measure,

00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:58.410 align:middle line:84%
that don't show up
in the statistics.

00:47:58.410 --> 00:48:02.427 align:middle line:84%
So we have people like Steven
Pinker citing these statistics

00:48:02.427 --> 00:48:04.260 align:middle line:84%
that the world is getting
better and better.

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:05.960 align:middle line:90%
Look at the numbers.

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.362 align:middle line:90%
But meanwhile--

00:48:07.362 --> 00:48:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's more bereft
of meaning and connection.

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:11.160 align:middle line:90%
Like, what about suicide rates?

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.330 align:middle line:90%
What about depression rates?

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:15.830 align:middle line:84%
What about just like the
general level of joyfulness?

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:17.790 align:middle line:90%
The freedom from anxiety?

00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:22.130 align:middle line:84%
Like, that kind of stuff,
it's a lot harder to measure

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:24.680 align:middle line:84%
and it's a lot harder to
say that we're actually--

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:26.460 align:middle line:84%
or the amount of
beauty in public space.

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:27.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: You know, I drive
down the four-lane divided

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:33.318 align:middle line:84%
highway, you know, and there's
the big box store and the strip

00:48:33.318 --> 00:48:33.390 align:middle line:90%
mall, and--

00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:35.098 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, my god,
just expansive gray

00:48:35.098 --> 00:48:36.540 align:middle line:90%
and asphalt and concrete.

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:37.350 align:middle line:90%
So depressing.

00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah Yeah.

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, after 5,000
years of architecture--

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is what we did?

00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: --is this
the best we can do?

00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is this
the best we can do?

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: We're supposed
to be advanced, you know?

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:44.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:47.377 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, OK, let's
move on past time banking.

00:48:47.377 --> 00:48:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear what you would look
at as maybe the second tenet

00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:51.870 align:middle line:90%
that you would really--

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:55.140 align:middle line:84%
if you could create the world
and paint it the way you wish,

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:56.620 align:middle line:90%
first is the debt forgiveness.

00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:58.800 align:middle line:90%
What might come in behind that?

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Well,
so there's-- yeah,

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:03.283 align:middle line:90%
the debt forgiveness which--

00:49:03.283 --> 00:49:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Free people.

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.408 align:middle line:90%
Get the weight off our backs.

00:49:05.408 --> 00:49:06.330 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:08.970 align:middle line:90%
And then to bring in--

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:11.023 align:middle line:84%
I call it negative
interest economics.

00:49:11.023 --> 00:49:12.690 align:middle line:84%
I won't go into that
too much right now.

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:12.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:13.620 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:15.450 align:middle line:90%
Universal basic income.

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:17.055 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: And then also--

00:49:17.055 --> 00:49:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there's some good
books out on that right now.

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:20.400 align:middle line:90%
Debates--

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --about how this
can work, what the detriment

00:49:23.370 --> 00:49:24.300 align:middle line:90%
and what the benefit is.

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:25.800 align:middle line:90%
It's rising into conscious now.

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:26.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:26.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And then the other thing is
to reunite ecology and economy

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.830 align:middle line:84%
so that it's no longer
possible to profit

00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:37.260 align:middle line:84%
by exporting your
costs onto nature

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:39.630 align:middle line:90%
and onto future generations.

00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:43.860 align:middle line:84%
So then if the best
business decision

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:46.740 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the best
ecological decision,

00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:49.080 align:middle line:84%
then business and
environment no longer

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.480 align:middle line:84%
have to be in competition
with each other.

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That just
makes perfect sense.

00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: So we
need to reward behavior

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:58.990 align:middle line:90%
that heals the environment.

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:01.530 align:middle line:84%
For example,
agricultural subsidies

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:05.730 align:middle line:84%
need to turn toward regenerative
agriculture that builds soil.

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Farmers need to be
paid to build soil.

00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:10.698 align:middle line:84%
So then any decision
that they make

00:50:10.698 --> 00:50:12.240 align:middle line:84%
that is to the
detriment of the soil,

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.910 align:middle line:84%
even if it produces
cheaper commodities,

00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:17.760 align:middle line:90%
will no longer be economic.

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:20.460 align:middle line:84%
So they'll have a
financial incentive

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:27.210 align:middle line:84%
that helps them enact their
deep heart desire to be

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:29.317 align:middle line:90%
in harmony with their land.

00:50:29.317 --> 00:50:31.650 align:middle line:84%
They actually, most of them
actually do love their land.

00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:35.515 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to be pouring
poisons onto the soil.

00:50:35.515 --> 00:50:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They just
don't know how else

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:38.340 align:middle line:90%
to keep the numbers up.

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:40.090 align:middle line:84%
They're in an
impossible situation.

00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: And the
impossible situation

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:45.570 align:middle line:84%
is in part because of
the social agreements

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:48.310 align:middle line:90%
that we call government policy.

00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:49.270 align:middle line:90%
And that can change.

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It can.

00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, a
couple of things.

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:55.620 align:middle line:84%
What you're talking about just
requires such incredibly wise,

00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:59.040 align:middle line:84%
mature, clear thinking,
and not just local

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.720 align:middle line:84%
levels but also at high
levels to make this work.

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And years ago I interviewed
a man named Rob Williams who

00:51:04.890 --> 00:51:08.460 align:middle line:84%
talked about how corporations--
and he had provided this role,

00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:10.920 align:middle line:90%
even, I think at Enron--

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.710 align:middle line:84%
need to have what you call
a chief shamanic officer.

00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:15.390 align:middle line:84%
A person that has
the wisdom to look

00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:19.028 align:middle line:84%
at how all things fit together
and what benefits the whole.

00:51:19.028 --> 00:51:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is the kind of
holistic thinker you are,

00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:23.170 align:middle line:84%
which is why I
admire you so much.

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:27.720 align:middle line:84%
But we need to have the presence
of people like you at higher

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:33.940 align:middle line:84%
levels and not just driven at
grassroots communities as well.

00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:36.330 align:middle line:84%
But a grassroot community, I
mean, that's a way to begin.

00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Grassroots is
always a place where

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:39.970 align:middle line:90%
we can personally plug in.

00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:51:40.770 --> 00:51:43.598 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think if I were
the chief shamanic officer

00:51:43.598 --> 00:51:46.140 align:middle line:84%
at a corporation, I'm not sure
how much good I could actually

00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:46.650 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: Because
understanding--

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The system is just
too wired toward the previous,

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:50.620 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:50.900 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Previous model.

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: The
pressure on them to--

00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we just have to
build it from the ground up.

00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:56.790 align:middle line:84%
We just have to start making
new agreements on a very

00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:58.230 align:middle line:90%
personal level, it sounds like.

00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:00.563 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: I would say
that we don't know what to do.

00:52:00.563 --> 00:52:01.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's good.

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:04.860 align:middle line:84%
It's good to admit that we
don't know what to do right now.

00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Because so many of
our solutions are

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:08.940 align:middle line:84%
coming from the same
mindset as the problems--

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:10.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: --that they
end up worsening the problem.

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.130 align:middle line:10%
I wrote a book on
climate change, too,

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:16.080 align:middle line:10%
and I give some
examples of this.

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:19.830 align:middle line:10%
That biofuels
plantations, for example,

00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:26.340 align:middle line:10%
that are meant to address
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:30.320 align:middle line:10%
but end up doing so much
damage to land and to cultures

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.070 align:middle line:10%
that they end up making
the problem worse.

00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:33.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:35.640 align:middle line:84%
That's where this really
high holistic thinking,

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:39.590 align:middle line:84%
the proper use of intellect
needs to be employed.

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:40.702 align:middle line:90%
And our own intuition.

00:52:40.702 --> 00:52:41.910 align:middle line:90%
We know some of these things.

00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:42.780 align:middle line:90%
We know.

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:44.520 align:middle line:90%
We know it doesn't work.

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: I did
this thought experiment.

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:48.062 align:middle line:84%
You know, back in
the '60s they said,

00:52:48.062 --> 00:52:51.660 align:middle line:84%
if only we could put LSD in
the drinking water supply

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and everybody would have
a spiritual awakening,

00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:55.135 align:middle line:90%
then everything would change.

00:52:55.135 --> 00:52:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of did a
thought experiment.

00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:58.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, OK, what
if that happened?

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has this
mind-blowing psychedelic trip,

00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:05.430 align:middle line:84%
and then, now it's
Monday morning.

00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:06.660 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:07.572 align:middle line:90%
You go back to work.

00:53:07.572 --> 00:53:08.372 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:08.372 --> 00:53:10.260 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of what
did happen, actually.

00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:11.550 align:middle line:90%
That's what happens.

00:53:11.550 --> 00:53:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] There's
a new book out on it.

00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:13.740 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yeah.

00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:16.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: So something
else has to happen.

00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there's
two things that are

00:53:19.770 --> 00:53:22.020 align:middle line:90%
needed for us to really go--

00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:25.380 align:middle line:84%
to really pass through
this metamorphosis.

00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:28.680 align:middle line:84%
One is the push,
and one is the pull.

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:34.890 align:middle line:84%
The push is the breakdown of
the world that we're used to.

00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:37.860 align:middle line:84%
The failure of our systems,
which isn't necessarily

00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:39.210 align:middle line:90%
a total failure.

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:43.800 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they get
less and less attractive.

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the pull,
which is these experiences

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:50.310 align:middle line:84%
that we have that show us
that a more beautiful world is

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:51.730 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:56.250 align:middle line:84%
That show us what human life
could be in cooperation.

00:53:56.250 --> 00:54:00.122 align:middle line:84%
That show us what medicine
could be when it embraces

00:54:00.122 --> 00:54:01.080 align:middle line:90%
the wisdom of the body.

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:02.640 align:middle line:84%
That show us what
agriculture can

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:08.400 align:middle line:84%
be when we are in cooperation
with nature and not

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.848 align:middle line:90%
in opposition to nature.

00:54:09.848 --> 00:54:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Like, we have these
experiences, they

00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:15.010 align:middle line:84%
could be spiritual experiences,
mystical experiences,

00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:18.860 align:middle line:84%
they could be
relational experiences.

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And you've probably
had these, where

00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:24.600 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't feel like an
exception to reality,

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:28.180 align:middle line:84%
but it feels like a
promise of what could be.

00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:31.650 align:middle line:10%
So we need the pull, which
takes the form of some

00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:33.960 align:middle line:10%
of these amazing
alternative projects

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:37.590 align:middle line:10%
that are on the margins, as
we were talking about before.

00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:39.450 align:middle line:90%
And then we also need to push.

00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Without the pull, we
just feel despair.

00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:46.050 align:middle line:90%
Without the push, there's--

00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:47.907 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Little
impetus to change.

00:54:47.907 --> 00:54:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: The old
systems just keep us there,

00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:51.780 align:middle line:84%
even if we don't
agree with them.

00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:52.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:52.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Right.

00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I couldn't
agree more with you.

00:54:54.850 --> 00:54:56.940 align:middle line:90%
And we also have to just--

00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:58.770 align:middle line:84%
we're afraid to tell
ourselves the truth.

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:00.750 align:middle line:90%
Like, I'm exhausted.

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:02.193 align:middle line:84%
I can't stand the
way I'm feeling

00:55:02.193 --> 00:55:03.360 align:middle line:90%
and the way I'm living life.

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:04.902 align:middle line:84%
I don't even have
time to do anything

00:55:04.902 --> 00:55:07.650 align:middle line:84%
that makes me feel
connected, juicy, joyful.

00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's a matter of
getting honest with ourselves

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:11.397 align:middle line:90%
without any agenda.

00:55:11.397 --> 00:55:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So it does start on a
deeply personal level.

00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: And
it's scary to do that,

00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:16.410 align:middle line:84%
because then you
don't know what to do.

00:55:16.410 --> 00:55:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: It's not
like you admit that,

00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
you know what to do.

00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:55:20.090 --> 00:55:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EISENSTEIN: You have
to go through the--

00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:22.750 align:middle line:84%
I call it the space
between stories.

00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
stories come back in.

00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:28.010 align:middle line:10%
Listening to each other's
stories, how one person

00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:29.720 align:middle line:10%
found their way forward.

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.820 align:middle line:10%
You know, and this is a
lending hand to someone

00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:33.260 align:middle line:10%
else who's come
to this discovery

00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:34.650 align:middle line:10%
and doesn't know what to do.

00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:35.450 align:middle line:90%
And it's beautiful.

00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:37.880 align:middle line:84%
That's where we all come
in, because we actually need

00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:40.670 align:middle line:90%
each other now more than ever.

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:41.810 align:middle line:90%
Always did, just forgot.

00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>EISENSTEIN: Yes.

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:42.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:43.750 align:middle line:90%
We need each other.

00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:44.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.680 align:middle line:84%
On that note, Charles,
we're out of time.

00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:47.850 align:middle line:90%
And I to thank you so much.

00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:50.308 align:middle line:84%
And I will continue following
your work because I just love

00:55:50.308 --> 00:55:51.890 align:middle line:90%
the clarity of your thinking.

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And you have these
beautiful shiny eyes.

00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:55.720 align:middle line:84%
It's showing me
that you actually--

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:58.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, I know you wanted to do the
rich and famous thing at one

00:55:58.220 --> 00:55:59.817 align:middle line:84%
point, but you're
really showing up.

00:55:59.817 --> 00:56:01.400 align:middle line:84%
