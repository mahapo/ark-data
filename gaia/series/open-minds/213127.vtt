00:00:15.183 --> 00:00:17.350 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: One
would think that it would be

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.800 align:middle line:10%
the deepest desire of a doctor
to know with certainty what ails

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.390 align:middle line:10%
the patient sitting
in front of them,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.390 align:middle line:10%
but our institutions have been
slow to adopt the help of those

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.470 align:middle line:10%
who can see.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.730 align:middle line:90%
But that's changing.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Wendie Colter is
at the leading edge

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.770 align:middle line:84%
of bringing medical intuition
into the field of medicine.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And such a major dharma to
carry, but you're the person.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.610 align:middle line:84%
It's good to have
you back again.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>> WENDIE COLTER: Thank you so
much for having me back, Regina.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.397 align:middle line:90%
It's such a pleasure.

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So last
time you were here,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.697 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of waving the
flag that if you're intuitive

00:00:47.697 --> 00:00:49.780 align:middle line:84%
and sensitive-- even if
you don't know you're that

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.600 align:middle line:84%
intuitive, but
sensitive, caring person,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.850 align:middle line:84%
the type of person that
likes to give care to others,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.590 align:middle line:84%
this is an actual profession
that can be developed now

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.060 align:middle line:90%
because of people like you.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.560 align:middle line:84%
You're doing an incredible job
of making this a legit field

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.630 align:middle line:84%
for people to take up as a
career path, so thank you again.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's go ahead
and go on, start

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.720 align:middle line:84%
talking about what's going
on since we last talked.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.813 align:middle line:84%
First of all, maybe
just give a little bit

00:01:16.813 --> 00:01:18.980 align:middle line:84%
of historical background
for those who don't already

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.400 align:middle line:90%
know you, of you.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.200 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Of me?

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.110 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] Well, I've
been a medical intuitive

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.470 align:middle line:10%
for more than 20 years
now as a professional,

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.870 align:middle line:10%
and I've been
teaching my programs

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.930 align:middle line:10%
to health care professionals
for about 15 years now.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's been so gratifying
to see the field grow--

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: --and the interest
from the integrative medical

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.920 align:middle line:90%
field also grow.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.550 align:middle line:10%
One of the things
that I also do is

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.410 align:middle line:10%
I teach at integrative
centers around the country,

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.400 align:middle line:10%
so the Academy of Integrative
Health and Medicine,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.410 align:middle line:10%
Andrew Weil Center, and others.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.340 align:middle line:84%
It's been so gratifying to
actually lecture and teach

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.390 align:middle line:84%
about this skill to fourth year
medical students and residents

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.270 align:middle line:84%
and integrative health care
professionals, doctors,

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.320 align:middle line:90%
and nurses.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's really kind of an
exploding field, I would say.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That, to me, is so
exciting to hear because up till

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.550 align:middle line:90%
now, it's been a crapshoot.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.350 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And it depends on
what kind of mood

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.847 align:middle line:84%
your doctor's in, what kind
of HMO they're working with,

00:02:19.847 --> 00:02:21.930 align:middle line:84%
whether they get more than
seven minutes with you.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:22.270 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You know?

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got
your standard diagnosis,

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.300 align:middle line:84%
your standard drugs
that are pasted over it.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.140 align:middle line:84%
This is not serving
humanity any longer.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.460 align:middle line:90%
The system is broken.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: Well, you know,
the clinicians, the doctors,

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.420 align:middle line:84%
the nurses, et cetera, that are
drawn to this or want to work

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.780 align:middle line:84%
with medical intuitives, and
there's more and more now,

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.390 align:middle line:84%
they understand the
broken system, Regina,

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.840 align:middle line:84%
and they understand it on a
personal level because they

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.730 align:middle line:84%
don't have enough time
with their patients.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.090 align:middle line:90%
They're under so much pressure.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: And they can't really
do the art of medicine when

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.320 align:middle line:84%
you're seven minutes
with a patient.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.120 align:middle line:90%
Even 15.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not enough.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is really a great
place for medical intuition

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.380 align:middle line:90%
to kind of fill that gap.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the other thing
that's fabulous about medical

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.430 align:middle line:84%
intuition is that oftentimes
when people are stuck,

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.350 align:middle line:84%
doctors are stuck,
and they're like,

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.380 align:middle line:84%
this isn't making any sense
from presenting symptoms,

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.357 align:middle line:84%
that's where a medical intuitive
can come in and really--

00:03:18.357 --> 00:03:20.690 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to talk about
the really deep connection

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.900 align:middle line:84%
of spirit, mind, and matter a
little bit later in the show,

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.150 align:middle line:84%
but that's where you can
come in and reflect something

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.960 align:middle line:84%
of a deeper, more
complex nature to them.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:90%
Well, absolutely.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And I've been
working with doctors,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.010 align:middle line:84%
you know, under the table,
like in the background,

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.127 align:middle line:84%
and so have many, many medical
intuitives for decades.

00:03:38.127 --> 00:03:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You mean they don't
want their establishments

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.150 align:middle line:90%
to know they're--

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: No.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --they're sending
them kind of on the sly to you?

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.440 align:middle line:90%
We get a lot of referrals.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And while there are a couple
of studies I can talk about,

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.710 align:middle line:84%
the first one was a study
from 2020 that was published

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.920 align:middle line:84%
in the "Journal of Integrative
and Complementary Medicine,"

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.120 align:middle line:84%
and that was with the
graduates of my program and 67

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.830 align:middle line:90%
participants from the community.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And the participants rated
the medical intuitives

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:84%
as 94% accurate in
intuiting the location

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and evaluating their health
issue, their primary health

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.230 align:middle line:84%
issue with absolutely
no information up front.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's crazy, 94%.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: Yeah,
94% accuracy there.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And we also saw 98%
accuracy in their ability

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.210 align:middle line:84%
to pinpoint the historical life
experience that led or could

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.828 align:middle line:90%
have led to the health issue.

00:04:30.828 --> 00:04:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And I know you want
to get into that,

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.787 align:middle line:84%
so I wanted to
bring that forward.

00:04:33.787 --> 00:04:34.587 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:34.587 --> 00:04:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: We also,
from that study,

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:42.050 align:middle line:84%
received 94% consistency
with the participants' known

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.870 align:middle line:90%
diagnosis.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And again, this was
a blinded study.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.200 align:middle line:84%
The medical intuitive
had no prior knowledge.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And that final
piece of information

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:84%
made all the doctors
who look at that kind

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.430 align:middle line:90%
of sit up and take notice.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, how
are they doing that?

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.550 align:middle line:84%
So did you find that,
generally speaking,

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.300 align:middle line:84%
the nurses might have
been more open to taking

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.210 align:middle line:84%
your course than, say,
the MDs, or is it now

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.100 align:middle line:90%
starting-- is that shifting?

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.650 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: Oh, nurses have
always been on the leading edge

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:13.450 align:middle line:90%
with this.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.810 align:middle line:84%
There's over 30
years of research

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.910 align:middle line:84%
from the nursing sector
on intuition in nursing.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.340 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating stuff.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And yes, nurses, but now
we're getting a lot of MDs

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.430 align:middle line:84%
through the program,
which is fantastic,

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.882 align:middle line:84%
because they get very excited
about how they can use that

00:05:28.882 --> 00:05:30.090 align:middle line:90%
directly with their patients.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We have to start
using higher knowledge.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.887 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: We have to start.

00:05:32.887 --> 00:05:34.135 align:middle line:90%
Perfectly said.

00:05:34.135 --> 00:05:36.510 align:middle line:84%
We're also getting a lot of
complementary and alternative

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.705 align:middle line:84%
licensed practitioners such as
acupuncturists, chiropractors.

00:05:40.705 --> 00:05:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Excellent.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's really, it's
just a growing field.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is, to me,
this is really a bright star

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.660 align:middle line:84%
on the horizon, and
it's actually here--

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --of what's
going on in the world.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Too often, we look at
everything that's not working,

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.660 align:middle line:84%
but this is actually
working and growing.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.460 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: It is
working and growing.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.950 align:middle line:84%
One other survey
that was done, which

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.260 align:middle line:84%
has now added to
the literature, is

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.390 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about
medical intuitives who

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.200 align:middle line:90%
work with doctors.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And again, that has
been so clandestine.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: And by the way,
that goes back over 200 years,

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.580 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:84%
It's like there have always
been quiet consultations taking

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.970 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, even with the
world of homeopathy and doctors,

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.155 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it used to be
they could collaborate.

00:06:22.155 --> 00:06:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know, it's
considered superstition.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: Oh, this
whole thing is--

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.012 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's just ridiculous.

00:06:28.012 --> 00:06:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: It needs to
come out of the shadows.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it does.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:31.155 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:06:31.155 --> 00:06:32.880 align:middle line:84%
Some of the data that
we gathered, and this

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.755 align:middle line:84%
is from the National
Organization for Medical

00:06:34.755 --> 00:06:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Intuition, our
very first survey,

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.960 align:middle line:84%
we wanted to find out what
medical intuitives were

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.040 align:middle line:90%
doing out there.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.480 align:middle line:90%
Were they working with doctors?

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.220 align:middle line:90%
Were they doing stand alone?

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.020 align:middle line:84%
What kind of intuition
did they use?

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.562 align:middle line:84%
You know, a whole
bunch of questions.

00:06:47.562 --> 00:06:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And we found that
82% assist directly

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.690 align:middle line:84%
licensed medical professionals
with medical intuition.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.810 align:middle line:84%
82% of professional medical
intuitives in the US.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:01.827 align:middle line:90%
Who knew?

00:07:01.827 --> 00:07:02.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's amazing.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:03.390 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Who knew?

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: And 86% said
they receive referrals.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.230 align:middle line:84%
That number didn't surprise
me, but I had no idea

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.755 align:middle line:90%
we were in the 80%--

00:07:11.755 --> 00:07:12.555 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:12.555 --> 00:07:13.170 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't have guessed it.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.520 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: And I would
guess it's more now.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You know, you
were talking about nurses

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and intuition and studies
that have been done

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.020 align:middle line:84%
on their intuition, and there
is just a tragic story that

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.520 align:middle line:90%
involved my own mother.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:84%
My mother, sister,
niece, they were all

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.970 align:middle line:90%
in-- they were all nurses.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And my mother-- a person had
been through a procedure.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.303 align:middle line:90%
They were fine.

00:07:34.303 --> 00:07:36.220 align:middle line:84%
But they were coming
out, they were coming out

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.200 align:middle line:84%
from under anesthesia,
and the doctor

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.490 align:middle line:90%
said, give them orange juice.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And so she attempted
to give the patient

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.590 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of orange
juice, and the patient

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:90%
was not responding.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.090 align:middle line:84%
My mother could see
it wasn't right.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle line:90%
Something was wrong here.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.960 align:middle line:84%
They weren't maybe
ready to swallow.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that mechanism
wasn't ready yet

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.590 align:middle line:84%
from coming out from
under anesthesia.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:54.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:56.380 align:middle line:90%
This was a long time ago.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.440 align:middle line:84%
But he said, I said feed
him that orange juice,

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.260 align:middle line:84%
and the man drowned in the
equivalent of a tablespoon

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.100 align:middle line:90%
of orange juice.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.840 align:middle line:90%
My mother never got over it--

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: How
could she, though?

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.755 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --because
she was so--

00:08:06.755 --> 00:08:10.570 align:middle line:84%
of her generation, the
quiet generation, afraid

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.590 align:middle line:90%
of authority--

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yes.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --and afraid to be
fired for not just doing what

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.250 align:middle line:90%
she was told.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.670 align:middle line:84%
That could never
happen in your world.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: You know, [CHUCKLES],,
you're talking really about

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.770 align:middle line:84%
a still existing hierarchy in
the medical world that I'm aware

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:31.480 align:middle line:84%
of, and that the medical
intuitive nurses that gravitate

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.929 align:middle line:84%
to my program who've used their
intuition in the hospitals,

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:38.890 align:middle line:84%
in the clinics, at bedside
in the ICU, in the ER,

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:43.630 align:middle line:84%
they have to be very careful
about what they say to whom.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And what's really fun about this
is the graduates of my program

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.540 align:middle line:84%
who work at the
VA or at whatever,

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:54.850 align:middle line:84%
they are open with
their doctors about what

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:56.500 align:middle line:90%
they do, more and more of them.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And more and more of them
are coming back with stories

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.185 align:middle line:84%
saying, well, my doctor just,
you know, he pulls me aside

00:09:01.185 --> 00:09:02.393 align:middle line:90%
and he says, what about this?

00:09:02.393 --> 00:09:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, I love it.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: And like, yeah.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.235 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's
getting better?

00:09:05.235 --> 00:09:06.527 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: It's getting better.

00:09:06.527 --> 00:09:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And we want to see
it in hospitals.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.230 align:middle line:84%
We want medical intuitives on
every floor of every clinic.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And you have that, and then
we have a medical system

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.967 align:middle line:84%
that can really benefit the
patients, benefit the doctors.

00:09:17.967 --> 00:09:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Be much more
efficient in getting

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:90%
to the problem.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Well, I think so.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that gets us to
the other part of this story,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.130 align:middle line:84%
because we didn't talk
about this last time.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.570 align:middle line:90%
It's so obvious.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.570 align:middle line:84%
In our audience, most
everyone watching this show

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.750 align:middle line:84%
believes that there is a
spirit, mind, body connection

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.080 align:middle line:84%
but is often trying to
convince others in their lives

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:42.510 align:middle line:84%
to look into this, acknowledge
it, trust it, maybe even

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.430 align:middle line:84%
get some help from
someone like yourself,

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.970 align:middle line:84%
and they just don't
want to go there.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.220 align:middle line:90%
They're still resistant to it.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.480 align:middle line:84%
But medical intuitive
work can really

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:56.280 align:middle line:84%
start proving to the public
where the source of disease

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.400 align:middle line:90%
starts.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I would love it
if you would tell me

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.030 align:middle line:84%
a few stories of people that
were kind of shocked where they

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.250 align:middle line:84%
came in with, you know, my
toe's swollen or whatever,

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.530 align:middle line:84%
and then you traced it
back, traced it back,

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and were just shocked at
the origin of a condition.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.590 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: Well, I'll
say this, Regina.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:18.840 align:middle line:84%
It's always surprising and often
shocking because so much of this

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:24.720 align:middle line:84%
comes from traumatic life
experiences that might not

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.640 align:middle line:90%
be recognized as traumatic.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:31.530 align:middle line:84%
But to the body's physiology and
the body's awareness, they are.

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.410 align:middle line:84%
One wonderful gentleman
I read-- and you know,

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.600 align:middle line:84%
he was shocked, but not
because it was shocking.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.250 align:middle line:84%
He was shocked at
the origin of it--

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.190 align:middle line:84%
he was dealing with
a prostate issue.

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And his numbers were going up,
and he was worried about it.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And he called me and he
said, what can you see?

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.130 align:middle line:90%
And I pinpointed--

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:55.290 align:middle line:84%
I won't talk about the physical
stuff, just the mind-body stuff.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:58.920 align:middle line:84%
I pinpointed a time
in his life where

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.400 align:middle line:84%
he was having to decide
between who to marry.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.480 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] OK?

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Who can I marry?

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.520 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And there were two women that
he was really interested in,

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.850 align:middle line:84%
and he married one and
regretted it ever since.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was in the throes of a
divorce when he came to see me.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And I work with
higher self, and I

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.310 align:middle line:84%
ask higher self to show
me where the origins are.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And oddly, the origins of his
issue were in that moment early,

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.190 align:middle line:84%
early on when he was trying to
make this interesting decision

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:30.330 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of his life.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And how did
this play out in his body?

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.723 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: How it played out in
his body had to do with how he

00:11:34.723 --> 00:11:37.840 align:middle line:84%
identified himself
as a man, as a male.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't want to get
too far into the details

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.570 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want
to divulge, but he

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:47.520 align:middle line:84%
had some interesting identity
about what it means to be a man

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and how to take
care of a family,

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.830 align:middle line:84%
and that all played
into an imbalance

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.300 align:middle line:84%
in the prostate, which
is the male gland, right?

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: And there was a
really interesting connection

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:02.880 align:middle line:84%
for him to notice that his body
was telling him that his manhood

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.060 align:middle line:84%
wasn't caught up in what
he thought it was caught up

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:11.250 align:middle line:84%
in, about being responsible,
taking care of and overextending

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.620 align:middle line:84%
himself, and not taking
care of his own self care,

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.680 align:middle line:84%
which really kind of becomes the
bottom line for almost everyone.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.813 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: And that was an
interesting thing to look at.

00:12:20.813 --> 00:12:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, so now
he has this information.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What does
that do for him?

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:28.830 align:middle line:84%
How is he able to utilize that
to help strengthen his prostate?

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: Well, a lot of the
recommendations that come from

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.165 align:middle line:90%
higher self and from the body--

00:12:33.165 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:84%
certainly, there are
physical recommendations

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.680 align:middle line:84%
that come from the body
about things that might

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.450 align:middle line:90%
help balance the prostate.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And for the emotional
part for him,

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.320 align:middle line:84%
it was validating for
him really to hear

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:52.560 align:middle line:84%
that that struggle that he had
40 years ago actually played out

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:84%
in a later life imbalance that
really had its root there.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And for him, it made him really
think about what was important

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.400 align:middle line:90%
for him going forward.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: How could he live
his life to honor his own sense

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.440 align:middle line:84%
of maleness, manhood, what it
means to be a responsible man,

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.050 align:middle line:84%
and what it means to take care
of yourself as a responsible

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:13.590 align:middle line:90%
man?

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:14.810 align:middle line:84%
Which I thought was really
fascinating for me--

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, I love it.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: --because we talk
about women's self-care all

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.200 align:middle line:90%
the time.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.460 align:middle line:84%
It's like, wow, that's
men's self-care.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.690 align:middle line:84%
OK, we love stories,
OK, because all of us

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:27.420 align:middle line:84%
like to kind of see
ourselves and feel ourselves

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.095 align:middle line:90%
in the experiences of others.

00:13:29.095 --> 00:13:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we'll get back
to some stats on all later.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.630 align:middle line:84%
But I think people have
gotten the idea here--

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to get into the
upcoming study, or the study

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.430 align:middle line:84%
that's already
underway, actually.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And so give us another
example of someone who was--

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.380 align:middle line:84%
even you were surprised,
like, wow, that's fascinating.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:51.220 align:middle line:84%
It's fascinating how this thread
from the soul works on through.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: It's every time.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.123 align:middle line:90%
Most of the time, Regina--

00:13:54.123 --> 00:13:56.332 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to answer this a
little bit more generally,

00:13:56.332 --> 00:13:57.150 align:middle line:90%
though--

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:01.680 align:middle line:84%
most of-- all of the time when I
look at life history, the higher

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.950 align:middle line:84%
self will take me back
to a moment in time

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:09.420 align:middle line:84%
that was like a fork in the
road almost energetically,

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:14.520 align:middle line:84%
where the mind and body were not
in sync, and that the imbalance

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.820 align:middle line:90%
grew from there.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.462 align:middle line:84%
And we don't think about early
life as-- well, actually,

00:14:18.462 --> 00:14:19.920 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
research on this--

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.175 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:14:20.175 --> 00:14:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.087 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: --that early life
trauma can create these later

00:14:23.087 --> 00:14:24.250 align:middle line:90%
life health issues.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:27.330 align:middle line:84%
So I want to get back to
that, what happened then.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you
kind of a composite

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.510 align:middle line:90%
because this shows up a lot in--

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: --women's lives and
women's readings, and that is,

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:39.390 align:middle line:84%
from an early age, being made
to, in the family dynamic,

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.970 align:middle line:84%
given a ton of
responsibility too young.

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: And that kind
of thing sets up a pattern

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:53.220 align:middle line:84%
of codependency, of bad
relationships where the woman is

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:56.200 align:middle line:84%
always the one on the
serving end, so to speak.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I see this over
and over in readings.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And you know, everybody's
story is unique, of course,

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.360 align:middle line:90%
but the theme seems to be there.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.523 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
intriguing me because, oh,

00:15:08.523 --> 00:15:10.440 align:middle line:84%
I got a whole other book
about this, you know?

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what are the
themes in people's lives

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:17.050 align:middle line:84%
that can really lead to a really
challenging health imbalance?

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:20.162 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be one where,
you know, they were--

00:15:20.162 --> 00:15:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Too much
responsibility at too young

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:22.920 align:middle line:90%
an age.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, this leads me to
another question, then.

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.210 align:middle line:84%
So when I was a kid,
and probably when

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:30.970 align:middle line:84%
you were a kid too, you
got to go out and play

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:32.500 align:middle line:84%
with your friends,
ride your bike,

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.050 align:middle line:84%
and you come in at dinner time
or when the sun went down,

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:36.812 align:middle line:84%
depending on what
time of year it was.

00:15:36.812 --> 00:15:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And you had a lot of free
time to be and to play

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.730 align:middle line:84%
and to be outdoors and
to express yourself

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:43.880 align:middle line:90%
among your peers.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:44.680 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now we get to
generations of kids who are

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.880 align:middle line:84%
overprotected, and
they are definitely--

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.040 align:middle line:84%
I think they have too
much responsibility

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.730 align:middle line:84%
on their shoulders in terms
of insisting that they take

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.940 align:middle line:84%
on one kind of lesson
after another, for example,

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.490 align:middle line:84%
after school, and
their free time

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:07.810 align:middle line:84%
seems to be narrower and
narrower as time goes on here.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:12.490 align:middle line:84%
What are you seeing with that in
terms of maybe the young people

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.410 align:middle line:84%
or kids from these
generations now,

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.890 align:middle line:84%
this newer generation that
has been overcommitted

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.590 align:middle line:90%
to doing too many things?

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.210 align:middle line:90%
It worries me.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Tell me what you're
seeing in their bodies,

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.720 align:middle line:84%
because parents
need to know this.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: You
know, what I see--

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't do a lot
of minors reading.

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:33.552 align:middle line:90%
I do some.

00:16:33.552 --> 00:16:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's not really true.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:38.000 align:middle line:84%
I probably do more than I think
I do, [LAUGHS],, because parents

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.740 align:middle line:84%
come to me to read their
kids if their child is

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.540 align:middle line:90%
having some issues.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And some of these
kids are teenagers and even

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:44.340 align:middle line:90%
in their 20s by now.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Exactly.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And I can read for a
parent up to age 18

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.320 align:middle line:84%
because then once they're an
adult, that's 18 and beyond,

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.070 align:middle line:84%
they would have to
have their own reading.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:57.860 align:middle line:84%
But for minors, I see a lot
of burden, psychic burden,

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.660 align:middle line:90%
emotional burden for them.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And not only are
they booked up to get

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.880 align:middle line:84%
good grades and the whole
nine yards, those AP

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.810 align:middle line:90%
classes, everything--

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's nothing wrong
with education, but boy,

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.140 align:middle line:90%
does it go over--

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.640 align:middle line:90%
it kind of goes overboard.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And you know, everybody's
intentions are good,

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.030 align:middle line:84%
but the result is
the same result

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:22.560 align:middle line:84%
that I see in anyone's body
when it comes to stress,

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.190 align:middle line:90%
emotional burden, overwork--

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:27.119 align:middle line:90%
you name it.

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But it's starting
in kids and teenagers.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Starting in kids.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:30.670 align:middle line:90%
Starting in kids.

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what do you see--
if there's kind of a common

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:37.500 align:middle line:84%
denominator to the type of
conditions you're seeing from

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.810 align:middle line:84%
people who are overburdened,
what would that look like

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:42.807 align:middle line:84%
in young people who
aren't toxic yet, per se?

00:17:42.807 --> 00:17:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Well, some are.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, some are.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:45.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.030 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: Kind of not
knowing their own self.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Third chakra's not
really being developed.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.370 align:middle line:84%
That's the self
identity, self awareness.

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Some kids are
highly that, highly

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.990 align:middle line:84%
self aware if they've
been nurtured that way,

00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:84%
and some kids don't know
up from down when it

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.140 align:middle line:90%
comes to their own mind.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Third chakras are
playing out in the digestive

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.840 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Exactly.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.410 align:middle line:90%
Digestive system issues.

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Lots of
allergies to food, sleep.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:12.030 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Sleep issues.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Just not having fun
issues, not feeling

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.110 align:middle line:84%
like they've had time
to really assimilate.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And there you go,
digestion again.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:23.383 align:middle line:90%
A lot of things--

00:18:23.383 --> 00:18:25.300 align:middle line:84%
you know, generally
speaking with older folks,

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.830 align:middle line:84%
you see back issues and
muscular stuff, and kids,

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.450 align:middle line:84%
you don't necessarily see that
unless there's a condition.

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: But more and more,
I do see conditions in children

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.510 align:middle line:84%
that people are coming to me to
say they've had this diagnosis

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.040 align:middle line:84%
or that diagnosis that's way,
way too young for that kind

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:43.840 align:middle line:90%
of thing.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so you just
brought something up a moment

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.950 align:middle line:84%
ago, which is their
lives are lacking joy.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And is there-- what are the
classes of chronic conditions

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:58.320 align:middle line:84%
that are associated with a
life with no joy or little joy?

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.837 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: Well, you're asking
a really interesting question,

00:19:01.837 --> 00:19:03.420 align:middle line:84%
and I would have to
answer it one way,

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.620 align:middle line:90%
and then I'll answer it.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's fine.

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:07.648 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: The first way I
answer it is that there's no one

00:19:07.648 --> 00:19:08.980 align:middle line:90%
way things manifest.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.290 align:middle line:90%
That's my philosophy.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:12.700 align:middle line:84%
There are some people
that say this equals that.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So if there's no joy,
then there's this issue.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't see things that way,
and that's been my philosophy

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.160 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning because
if you do that, then you're

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.920 align:middle line:84%
using that kind of
cookie cutter, which

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.460 align:middle line:90%
medicine is full of now anyway.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.870 align:middle line:90%
You don't need more of that.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:29.820 align:middle line:84%
But what I do see is
that, on a broad scale,

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:34.560 align:middle line:84%
if there's a lack of joy,
then there's a lack of ability

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.130 align:middle line:90%
to heal, frankly.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.300 align:middle line:90%
Slow healing process.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: Often without
question in almost every area.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: Joy, self
expression, self awareness,

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:49.650 align:middle line:84%
just feeling like you matter--
you know, these are all really--

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it sounds so,
almost so simplistic,

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.930 align:middle line:84%
but energetically
it is profound.

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what
about ancestral issues?

00:19:58.290 --> 00:19:59.230 align:middle line:90%
How often does-- yeah.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.030 align:middle line:90%
Let's--

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:00.830 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Always.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because this
is coming from a soul.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:05.040 align:middle line:84%
A soul is incarnated
into a family.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that we've
just brought DNA forward,

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:10.270 align:middle line:84%
we've brought their feelings
and beliefs forward,

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:11.380 align:middle line:90%
so we all know this.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So what is your experience when
you're dealing with clients

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:15.963 align:middle line:90%
and ancestral patterns?

00:20:15.963 --> 00:20:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: Well, I always
look at the genetics

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.910 align:middle line:84%
and the epigenetics,
meaning-- genetic means,

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.900 align:middle line:84%
what are the chromosomes
doing or not doing?

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Epigenetics is, what came down
the family line that could

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.160 align:middle line:90%
be influencing their health?

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And does that usually
show up in your readings?

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:30.680 align:middle line:90%
You'll see it?

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: If I
look for it, sure.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: Or if there's
a reason to look for it,

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:34.310 align:middle line:90%
absolutely.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.180 align:middle line:90%
It's part of the process.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:38.900 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to leave any stone
unturned, to put it that way.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:39.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And so within a
family, for example,

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.710 align:middle line:84%
you might see clusters
of the same kind

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.310 align:middle line:90%
of condition manifesting.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Sure.

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:50.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Do you have an
example of that, a family that--

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.350 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Oh, well--

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm sure
you have plenty, but.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: --depression can
come down the family line.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:59.210 align:middle line:10%
A lot of times, the mental
acuity, the mental ability

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:02.660 align:middle line:10%
to stay on top of things like
melancholy, depression, things

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.910 align:middle line:10%
like that, or
anxiousness, things

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:07.520 align:middle line:10%
like that, that can
be very hereditary,

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.140 align:middle line:10%
so sometimes that
does come down.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:15.530 align:middle line:84%
Very often, what I'll see is
an alcoholic parent or stress

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:18.710 align:middle line:84%
in that family, a lot
of fractious energy

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:21.770 align:middle line:84%
that can really play
havoc with people's, gosh,

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:24.110 align:middle line:84%
every system in their bodies,
particularly when they're

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.980 align:middle line:90%
children.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:30.828 align:middle line:84%
So as we get older, we tend
to kind of live our lives,

00:21:30.828 --> 00:21:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and we do our therapy,
and we have our self care,

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:33.560 align:middle line:90%
and we do all this stuff.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.102 align:middle line:84%
We think, well, that
was in the past.

00:21:35.102 --> 00:21:38.270 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to the body,
it's never in the past

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.830 align:middle line:90%
if it hasn't been resolved.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:43.070 align:middle line:84%
That's the main thing I think
medical intuition can offer.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to
solve the mystery,

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:48.890 align:middle line:84%
then talk to a qualified
medical intuitive

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:52.640 align:middle line:84%
can help you solve the mystery
of where these things come from.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What about cancer?

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Because so many people are
afraid, oh, I've got this gene,

00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:58.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to develop cancer.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:21:59.840 align:middle line:90%
That gene's in my family.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And well, Angelina Jolie gave
a lot of power to that story,

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:04.880 align:middle line:90%
honestly.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:06.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not--

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's
talk about it.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:13.250 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: My perspective is
that people walk around with all

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:16.670 align:middle line:84%
kinds of genetic material,
and sometimes it manifests

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.080 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes it doesn't.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.530 align:middle line:84%
So everyone has this
unique story about that.

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And it drives me a little
crazy, honestly, Regina,

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.110 align:middle line:90%
because it is so personal.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Not every piece of DNA
on the genetic test

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:32.700 align:middle line:90%
is going to manifest.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.310 align:middle line:84%
But it might set up
an area of weakness

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:39.300 align:middle line:84%
in the structure, the energetic
structure, which is worth

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:40.610 align:middle line:90%
looking at and taking steps.

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And also, we all
have cancer cells in our bodies.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.540 align:middle line:84%
We have so many
potentials lying there.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.010 align:middle line:84%
The notion that
you learn that you

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:49.890 align:middle line:84%
have this particular
genetic effect in your body,

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:52.740 align:middle line:84%
like Angelina Jolie and
the breast cancer gene,

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.330 align:middle line:90%
and took pro action--

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:57.900 align:middle line:84%
was proactive and had her
breasts removed and replaced

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and everything, which I
really was very concerned

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.100 align:middle line:90%
about that message.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: I don't
agree with that message,

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:06.520 align:middle line:84%
but I understand
where it comes from.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.790 align:middle line:90%
And it comes from most places--

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:11.400 align:middle line:84%
it comes from the place that
most imbalance comes from,

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.900 align:middle line:90%
and that is fear.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.370 align:middle line:90%
It comes from fear.

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Fear energy is
incredibly destructive.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:19.770 align:middle line:90%
So you asked about cancer.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Cancer is highly chaotic in
the body, so I would suggest--

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:27.660 align:middle line:84%
and this is the topic of
a new book I'm writing--

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.690 align:middle line:84%
look to see where the
chaos is in your life,

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:35.160 align:middle line:84%
and look to mitigate that
because you can internalize it

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.450 align:middle line:90%
very easily.

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:41.598 align:middle line:84%
And women do this all
the time, more so in--

00:23:41.598 --> 00:23:44.850 align:middle line:84%
societally, we're the ones
that bear the burdens.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, that burden
will come back.

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Those chickens do
come home sometimes,

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.400 align:middle line:84%
and you really
should watch that.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Everybody.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, that is true.

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:53.675 align:middle line:84%
You know, at the
time, and I wondered--

00:23:53.675 --> 00:23:55.530 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is just my
personal thought on it--

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:58.740 align:middle line:84%
that it really stirred
the women of the world up

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.800 align:middle line:84%
and created grave
anxiety and concern when

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.380 align:middle line:84%
she made that move because
one of the interesting things

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.330 align:middle line:84%
about her character,
it seems, is

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:09.000 align:middle line:90%
she is hands down a risk taker.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.470 align:middle line:90%
She paints outside the box.

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:13.270 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't appear to be
someone that lives in fear.

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:15.150 align:middle line:84%
So then you have to
get down to the notion,

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:16.890 align:middle line:90%
was it just an upgrade?

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:18.510 align:middle line:90%
Using that excuse.

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.000 align:middle line:84%
In which case, all these
people feared for nothing.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.250 align:middle line:84%
So you get these
messages, and you really

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:24.900 align:middle line:84%
have to look at who
the messenger is

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.860 align:middle line:84%
and what might be
going on there, too.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.800 align:middle line:84%
But it stirred a
lot of people up.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.150 align:middle line:90%
And she's not the only one.

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:32.950 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot having these
surgeries all the time.

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not one to say no
to that if that makes sense

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.080 align:middle line:90%
and it makes someone--

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:40.200 align:middle line:84%
if it lessens a
fear response, sure.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.190 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: Our bodies and
our energy systems react

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.830 align:middle line:90%
to our minds and our emotions.

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:49.180 align:middle line:84%
So find those thoughts
that feel good.

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.125 align:middle line:84%
And if it feels good to do
that, who are we to say no?

00:24:52.125 --> 00:24:53.107 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:24:53.107 --> 00:24:54.315 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, that's fine.

00:24:54.315 --> 00:24:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, if a
person wants to enhance

00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:00.030 align:middle line:84%
what they feel the aesthetics of
their bodies are, yeah, do it.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:01.700 align:middle line:90%
That's one's personal decision.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.450 align:middle line:84%
But I was just concerned
that maybe that's

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:06.600 align:middle line:84%
what it was but it was being
heralded as something else that

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.850 align:middle line:84%
caused a lot of disturbance
and fear in people,

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.470 align:middle line:84%
and we won't know
the answer to that.

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it's out there,
and I like the fact

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.380 align:middle line:90%
that you're answering to that.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.210 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: And I
take every client--

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:21.120 align:middle line:84%
every reading I do is
individual to the client.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:25.350 align:middle line:84%
It's never a one and
done for everyone.

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Again, that's what I
wave my flag against.

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:34.890 align:middle line:84%
That personalized health care,
I can't think of anything

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:37.970 align:middle line:84%
better than looking
in your physiology,

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.720 align:middle line:84%
looking in your energy
system, and saying,

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.400 align:middle line:90%
this is what's personal to you.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And it has nothing to
do with anybody else.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And because some people are
wired pretty strangely--

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there are people--

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and even the intuitive
is like, what?

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:53.200 align:middle line:84%
I know when people have
tried to read me, it's like,

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.480 align:middle line:90%
what is going on here?

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.290 align:middle line:84%
You don't even
live in your body.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:59.070 align:middle line:84%
So you get strange folks
coming through, too,

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and you have to try to
fit that overlay in.

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And from my understanding,
as the Earth pop

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.950 align:middle line:84%
continues populating, we're
getting stranger and stranger

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:08.750 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:09.833 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Hey, you know--

00:26:09.833 --> 00:26:10.656 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:10.656 --> 00:26:13.290 align:middle line:84%
--if you're in a body, there's
a reason to be in a body.

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:14.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We'll figure
out the other overlay.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And so, I mean, in
that sense, whether you

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:22.150 align:middle line:84%
live inside, spirit wise,
inside or just loosely

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.402 align:middle line:84%
attached to the body, you
still have the same issues

00:26:24.402 --> 00:26:25.360 align:middle line:90%
you're contending with.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Well, you got a body.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:26.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You got a body.

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:27.880 align:middle line:90%
You had parents.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.528 align:middle line:84%
You have the imprints
from ancestors.

00:26:29.528 --> 00:26:30.820 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: You have past lives.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people
watching this will say,

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:34.692 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I don't really live
in my body much either,

00:26:34.692 --> 00:26:36.490 align:middle line:90%
so that's why I brought that up.

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: Well, I can tell
you that living in your body is

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.360 align:middle line:84%
something your
body really likes.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, have to negotiate
that one next time down--

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:47.710 align:middle line:90%
next time down the road.

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:49.960 align:middle line:90%
Another thing is the notion--

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:54.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the whole epidemic
of digestive issues

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:55.623 align:middle line:90%
across the board.

00:26:55.623 --> 00:26:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Across the board.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.710 align:middle line:84%
So there has to be some
common theme there.

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: [LAUGHS] I love that
you're asking me about common

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:02.830 align:middle line:90%
themes.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:03.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, what I see-

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Just so most people
can see themselves in the story

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:06.220 align:middle line:90%
here and there.

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:06.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.295 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Of course.

00:27:07.295 --> 00:27:08.860 align:middle line:90%
Stress, oh, my god.

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Stress is probably
the number one

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.660 align:middle line:84%
messer-upper of
digestive systems,

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.650 align:middle line:90%
and stress is a big word.

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:19.780 align:middle line:84%
It's from the tiniest stress
to the massive stress.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:23.440 align:middle line:84%
But our bodies are--
here's what I've learned.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies have this
funny dual nature.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.660 align:middle line:84%
They're both fragile and highly
resilient at the same time.

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:30.260 align:middle line:90%
It's really interesting.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And there comes a point where
a balance can get tipped.

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:35.770 align:middle line:84%
When that balance
gets tipped, you

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:37.595 align:middle line:84%
got to go forensically
back and see what--

00:27:37.595 --> 00:27:38.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Tipped it.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:39.887 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: --would
have tipped it.

00:27:39.887 --> 00:27:42.170 align:middle line:90%
And why not go the other way?

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:42.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:46.480 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, if there are
some practical solutions

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.177 align:middle line:84%
to not eat food when
you're wound up,

00:27:49.177 --> 00:27:50.635 align:middle line:84%
maybe that's a good
place to start.

00:27:50.635 --> 00:27:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: [LAUGHS]

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And when
you're wound up,

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:56.250 align:middle line:84%
maybe not throw down a triple
latte with all that acid.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Right.

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:57.883 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You know?

00:27:57.883 --> 00:28:01.760 align:middle line:84%
There have to be some kind
of common sorts of advice

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.240 align:middle line:90%
one can have.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.120 align:middle line:84%
We were talking at lunch
with a lovely woman

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.330 align:middle line:84%
here at Gaia who said, if
you just take 10 breaths--

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:11.750 align:middle line:84%
she's a nutritionist-- 10
breaths before you eat,

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.780 align:middle line:84%
just calm yourself so your
body can accept the food--

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, there's a simple one.

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: Well, what I
see is the vagus nerve.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Talk about that,
because that's becoming more

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:20.660 align:middle line:90%
known.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.690 align:middle line:84%
The vagus nerve is
a cranial nerve,

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:24.440 align:middle line:84%
meaning it comes from
the back of the head

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.870 align:middle line:84%
and goes all the way
down through the body,

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:28.160 align:middle line:90%
and it hits almost--

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.860 align:middle line:84%
it attaches to almost every
organ system in the body.

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:32.660 align:middle line:90%
It's phenomenal.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's funny because
not much has been spoken of it

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.500 align:middle line:90%
until the last 10, 20 years.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yes, exactly.

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And the vagus nerve's
ability to do its job

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.680 align:middle line:84%
and send good impulses
to your intestines,

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.450 align:middle line:84%
for example, or your
heart or your lungs

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:51.600 align:middle line:84%
has to do with your stress
level, plain and simple.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Now again, I'm not a
health care practitioner,

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:55.940 align:middle line:84%
so I'm just telling
you what I've seen.

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And I will always look
at the vagus nerve

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.328 align:middle line:84%
when I-- as well as
the digestive system.

00:29:00.328 --> 00:29:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When you're
looking at a person,

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.220 align:middle line:90%
how does that show up to you?

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: In any
possible visual.

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I see it like-- you
know how a violin string gets

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:10.730 align:middle line:90%
really, really tightly wound?

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:11.855 align:middle line:90%
It's going to have to snap.

00:29:11.855 --> 00:29:13.190 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it looks like that.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:16.230 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it looks like it's
just zapping all the time.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it looks like
it's not doing anything.

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So there's a number of
ways it can show up,

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:24.320 align:middle line:84%
but the information is what
I'm asking for, regardless of--

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What it's affecting.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:27.373 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: Yeah,
what is it affecting?

00:29:27.373 --> 00:29:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And very often, I see the lungs,
the heart, the digestive system

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:34.910 align:middle line:84%
just not working properly
because there's so much stress

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:38.960 align:middle line:84%
that is being projected through
the nervous system, particularly

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.370 align:middle line:90%
the vagus nerve.

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you said
it starts at the base

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.140 align:middle line:90%
of the cranium?

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: It's the
base of the cranium.

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:44.473 align:middle line:90%
It's a cranial nerve.

00:29:44.473 --> 00:29:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And they go down
through the body,

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:48.860 align:middle line:84%
and all over, and into the head
as well-- mostly in the head.

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.940 align:middle line:84%
But the vagus nerve
is so important.

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And so these breathing
techniques and what you eat

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:56.990 align:middle line:84%
and how you eat and
what your lifestyle is,

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:58.700 align:middle line:84%
these are really
important factors,

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.050 align:middle line:84%
and everybody gets to make
the choice themselves.

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: I can tell you, if
you want kind of a broad stroke,

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.420 align:middle line:84%
when people have digestive
issues and they come to me,

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:10.915 align:middle line:84%
broad stroke wise,
generally speaking,

00:30:10.915 --> 00:30:12.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask
the higher self,

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:16.400 align:middle line:84%
how are they metabolizing
gluten, dairy, and white sugar?

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.543 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:17.543 --> 00:30:18.710 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Fine white sugar.

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:20.120 align:middle line:90%
And you know, intuitively--

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.340 align:middle line:84%
I'll just tell you a
little anecdote here--

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:25.190 align:middle line:84%
I've been working with my higher
self since I was a kid, right?

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:28.727 align:middle line:84%
And so intuitively, in
my 20s, my body went, OK,

00:30:28.727 --> 00:30:29.810 align:middle line:90%
that's it for white sugar.

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:30.860 align:middle line:90%
No more.

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:31.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, what?

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:32.840 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.650 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:33.890 align:middle line:90%
Please.

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Please.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:34.925 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Let's negotiate.

00:30:34.925 --> 00:30:35.870 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: There
was no negotiation.

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And I started researching,
and I read some great books--

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:40.730 align:middle line:90%
you know, "Sugar Blues"--

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That
was a great book.

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: --a bunch
of other things.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, this is
not from my body.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: And I started making
my own brownies and things with

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.890 align:middle line:84%
honey and whatever-- things
that my body could assimilate.

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And I got off gluten
almost immediately

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:56.090 align:middle line:90%
after that, and dairy.

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was just things that
my higher self said, yeah,

00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.735 align:middle line:84%
I think your body would
probably appreciate it

00:30:59.735 --> 00:31:00.830 align:middle line:90%
if you didn't eat that.

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- you know, if I
can put a point on all of this,

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.860 align:middle line:84%
it's working with a medical
intuitive who can pinpoint these

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:10.790 align:middle line:90%
things for you--

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Really important.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because sometimes you
don't even have to give it up,

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.080 align:middle line:84%
but maybe you have
a different version.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example,
when I'm in Europe--

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.190 align:middle line:84%
I spend a fair amount
of time in England--

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:24.470 align:middle line:84%
well, in the British
Isles-- and I

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:26.750 align:middle line:84%
find that the dairy
doesn't seem to bother me.

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And even the grain
doesn't bother me

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:34.710 align:middle line:84%
because it's very low gluten
compared to our red wheat.

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yes.

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, and we're talking
about the agribusiness that

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:38.610 align:middle line:90%
goes on here.

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And everything
that's put on it.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:40.730 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: It's--

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:43.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, and that--
and so what I started doing,

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:46.100 align:middle line:84%
because I like to bake-- you
know, I cook and I bake--

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:50.480 align:middle line:84%
is I started buying my flour,
and even bringing it back

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.770 align:middle line:90%
in bags, organic flour from--

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Good for you.

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:56.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --yeah, from Britain,
and I'll even order it online.

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And it does seem to
make a difference,

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:00.730 align:middle line:84%
so I don't have to give
up my guilty pleasure.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:01.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:03.250 align:middle line:90%
Sugar's another issue still.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:06.760 align:middle line:84%
But even like the A2
milk, the A2 molecule

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.640 align:middle line:84%
in the milk from the
Jersey cows there

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:13.670 align:middle line:84%
is very different in how
our body is affected by it.

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: We've got
a lot to learn here.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.478 align:middle line:84%
But you know, these are the
kinds of things that-- yeah,

00:32:18.478 --> 00:32:21.020 align:middle line:84%
there are some people who can
eat baloney sandwiches on white

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:24.090 align:middle line:84%
bread every day and
live to 102, so really--

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:27.440 align:middle line:84%
and ideally, we want to
look to see how it's working

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.880 align:middle line:90%
for everybody individually.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.070 align:middle line:90%
So you can help with that.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:32.790 align:middle line:90%
No, this is exciting.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's get to the study
that's underway now

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:39.710 align:middle line:84%
because you're
really at the lead

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:41.620 align:middle line:90%
of these particular studies.

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:44.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've taken this upon
yourself as your life's work,

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.108 align:middle line:84%
so you're speaking
with authority on this.

00:32:46.108 --> 00:32:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Oh, thank you.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:48.980 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate hearing that.

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Yes, so this study has been a
year in the making, [LAUGHS],,

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:56.090 align:middle line:84%
I will say, and
it's underway now.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:57.230 align:middle line:90%
So excited.

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And we have four or
five of my graduates--

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.060 align:middle line:84%
we're still figuring
out how many--

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:06.920 align:middle line:84%
again, and a whole
cohort of integrative

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.740 align:middle line:84%
and conventional
medicine doctors

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:13.380 align:middle line:84%
who have brought
in their patients.

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:17.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's medical intuitives,
doctors, and their patients

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:18.400 align:middle line:90%
in one session.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.733 align:middle line:90%
This has never been done before.

00:33:19.733 --> 00:33:20.983 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: This is incredible.

00:33:20.983 --> 00:33:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: Never
been studied before.

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And we thought,
what a great model.

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:27.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, it's
a wonderful model.

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:28.430 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So tell us
how it's structured,

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:32.770 align:middle line:84%
what you're starting
to see, and so forth.

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:35.595 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: Well, the study
is going to start very soon,

00:33:35.595 --> 00:33:37.470 align:middle line:84%
but we're getting all
the stuff together now.

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And again, we'll have
about five doctors,

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:42.697 align:middle line:84%
and each doctor will
have five to 10 patients,

00:33:42.697 --> 00:33:43.530 align:middle line:90%
so we may have more.

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:46.260 align:middle line:84%
I think it'll be a total
of 40 patients altogether.

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:49.170 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have a
follow-up-- because these

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:53.130 align:middle line:84%
are patients that have
issues that haven't resolved,

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:56.860 align:middle line:84%
or issues that have been
impossible to diagnose.

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So do we start
with what Western medicine

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:03.580 align:middle line:84%
or allopathic medicines toolkit
says they think is going on?

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yep.

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:05.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, excellent.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.608 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: So we start there.

00:34:06.608 --> 00:34:09.835 align:middle line:84%
So the doctor and the patient
will have an initial--

00:34:09.835 --> 00:34:12.210 align:middle line:84%
basically a follow-up consult
because these are long term

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:15.070 align:middle line:84%
patients of these doctors,
and everything they've tried

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:15.870 align:middle line:90%
isn't working.

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:17.020 align:middle line:90%
That kind of thing.

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:20.070 align:middle line:84%
So they have a consult, and
then they measure that consult.

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:21.300 align:middle line:90%
When you work--

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.449 align:middle line:84%
I'm working with a wonderful
Institute of Noetic Science.

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:26.290 align:middle line:84%
These people know
their research,

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:28.239 align:middle line:84%
so everything is
very structured.

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:29.250 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:32.139 align:middle line:84%
So every step of
the way is measured.

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:34.239 align:middle line:84%
So they have that, the
doctor and the patient,

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:36.300 align:middle line:84%
and then they together
have a consult

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.800 align:middle line:90%
with a medical intuitive.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's a one
hour consult, which

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:44.040 align:middle line:84%
is not standard usual operating
procedure in health care.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.290 align:middle line:84%
It's usually 15 to 20
minutes, if you're lucky.

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:47.889 align:middle line:84%
Here, we're going
to do an hour--

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:50.639 align:middle line:84%
45 minutes with the medical
intuitive, the doctor,

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:53.370 align:middle line:84%
and the patient,
and then 15 minutes

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:56.100 align:middle line:84%
with the medical
intuitive and the doctor.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And we've been testing
out the protocol

00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:01.920 align:middle line:84%
a little bit before
the study gets going,

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.090 align:middle line:84%
and we found that the
doctors are like, well,

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:06.587 align:middle line:84%
we need more time with
the medical intuitive.

00:35:06.587 --> 00:35:07.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, yes, of course you do.

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:08.880 align:middle line:90%
We know you do.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:09.390 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:10.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.680 align:middle line:90%
But that's a good start.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.930 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: It's a great start.

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So with this,
under these conditions,

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:20.310 align:middle line:84%
will the intuitive be able to,
or are they encouraged to go

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:25.030 align:middle line:84%
so far back as to the seed, the
mind-body ancestral whatever

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.830 align:middle line:90%
comes up?

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And these doctors
have all agreed that this is

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:32.410 align:middle line:84%
worth investigating, so
they're there voluntarily.

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They want to learn.

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: They want to learn.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.830 align:middle line:90%
And they're intrigued by it.

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:40.147 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I've
worked with doctors,

00:35:40.147 --> 00:35:42.480 align:middle line:84%
and when medical intuitives
work with doctors, generally

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.400 align:middle line:84%
speaking, it's about what's
happening in the here and now--

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.400 align:middle line:84%
the physiology, what can
they take, what procedures,

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.200 align:middle line:90%
what tests.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.700 align:middle line:90%
That's really their focus.

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:54.330 align:middle line:84%
However, we wanted to
do this study, Regina,

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:59.640 align:middle line:84%
because we wanted them to hear
the genesis of these issues

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.810 align:middle line:84%
from the life
history perspective.

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:06.593 align:middle line:84%
If they interview their patient
or they intake their patient,

00:36:06.593 --> 00:36:08.010 align:middle line:84%
patients don't
generally tell them

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:09.843 align:middle line:84%
what happened when they
were five years old.

00:36:09.843 --> 00:36:12.340 align:middle line:84%
They tell them when the ache
and pain started or whatever.

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:14.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is new
information for them.

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And we wanted to
do it because we

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:19.960 align:middle line:84%
wanted to expand their
understanding of mind, body,

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:20.850 align:middle line:90%
and spirit.

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Isn't that great?

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:22.695 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:36:22.695 --> 00:36:24.430 align:middle line:90%
It means it's happening finally.

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:25.230 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Finally.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You know?

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:27.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And with a lot
of hard work on your part

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:28.550 align:middle line:90%
and the others.

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:31.060 align:middle line:84%
So The Practical Path, that's
the name of your school.

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yes.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk about that
for a bit in terms of what it

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:39.745 align:middle line:84%
offers, the training, how long
it takes, and is anybody--

00:36:39.745 --> 00:36:42.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if someone says, oh,
my god, I'd love to do that,

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:45.150 align:middle line:84%
are there some people that just
aren't really naturally aligned

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:47.700 align:middle line:84%
with it, or does
everyone, if they love it,

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.190 align:middle line:84%
ultimately kind of
find their talent?

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:53.190 align:middle line:10%
>> COLTER: Well, in terms of
medical intuition as a field,

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:56.053 align:middle line:10%
anyone and everyone who is
interested in it can do it.

00:36:56.053 --> 00:36:57.345 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of a calling, really.

00:36:57.345 --> 00:36:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.323 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: And there are
a lot of places to learn.

00:37:00.323 --> 00:37:03.630 align:middle line:84%
My school in particular, I
teach health care professionals,

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:05.110 align:middle line:90%
and that's a broad sweep--

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:07.910 align:middle line:10%
>> COLTER: --health
coaches, massage therapists,

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:10.380 align:middle line:10%
nutritionists, all the
way to medical doctors.

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:13.020 align:middle line:10%
So anyone within
that field can--

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:15.810 align:middle line:10%
or those fields can
come and they qualify.

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:17.480 align:middle line:90%
And it's a learning curve.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, talk
about how it starts,

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.345 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
people must think, oh,

00:37:21.345 --> 00:37:24.042 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any
intuitive capacities.

00:37:24.042 --> 00:37:25.750 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
must show up that way,

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:27.292 align:middle line:90%
though they desire them.

00:37:27.292 --> 00:37:28.750 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: Everybody
has intuition.

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:31.840 align:middle line:90%
It is a hardwired human trait.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.300 align:middle line:84%
We don't not have
intuition, and sometimes we

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:36.610 align:middle line:84%
know just because we get
a gut feeling, you know?

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Or we know what we know because
we know it and all of that.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.710 align:middle line:84%
So it is something
that I believe

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:43.810 align:middle line:90%
is developable in anyone.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:48.880 align:middle line:84%
I teach a subset of that,
which is the visual intuition--

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.520 align:middle line:84%
clairvoyance, which is
a very stigmatized word,

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.440 align:middle line:84%
but it just means
seeing clearly--

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.690 align:middle line:84%
because I want to see
into the physiology.

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:57.710 align:middle line:84%
I want to see down to
the cellular level.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:00.820 align:middle line:84%
So that's the skill set that
I teach for this broader

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:02.510 align:middle line:90%
picture of medical intuition.

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:04.810 align:middle line:84%
So those are very
pinpoint skills.

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's level one, which
is a four-month program, which

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:11.270 align:middle line:84%
is one weekend a
month for four months.

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:13.940 align:middle line:84%
It's an intensive
practicum hours program,

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.490 align:middle line:84%
so people have to
do their homework.

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And from there, people can go
into the level two program,

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.660 align:middle line:90%
which is a five month--

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.640 align:middle line:90%
same idea, one weekend a month.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:26.570 align:middle line:84%
I teach live online on
Zoom, so we get students

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:28.080 align:middle line:90%
from all over the world.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.543 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:38:29.543 --> 00:38:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're growing the
community that way, too,

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:32.450 align:middle line:90%
the worldwide community.

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
that's wonderful.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And that program's-- I would
call it really a one year

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:40.340 align:middle line:84%
program because of the practicum
and the certification that we

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:43.760 align:middle line:84%
offer is a 200
hour certification.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:48.350 align:middle line:84%
It fits all of the criteria for
correct certification in the US,

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:52.100 align:middle line:84%
which I really wanted to
structure that way so that we

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:55.500 align:middle line:84%
can present ourselves to
not only the medical world,

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.830 align:middle line:84%
but also to state
legislative boards

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:01.250 align:middle line:84%
and say this is a legitimate
training and certification

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:04.070 align:middle line:84%
process in a very
specific skill set.

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:07.250 align:middle line:84%
That's something that
the field of energy

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:11.840 align:middle line:84%
biofield work hasn't really
gotten quite together yet.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it's true.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's take it down
to the level of a mom and her

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.320 align:middle line:84%
child or whatnot, and they're
not in the healing arts.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.600 align:middle line:84%
They're not in the
medical profession.

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.610 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
about people who

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:29.730 align:middle line:84%
develop their own kind
of divination processes?

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:30.830 align:middle line:90%
And I say this--

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:35.060 align:middle line:84%
one of my main mentors in life
was a wild, wild Russian woman

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:38.360 align:middle line:84%
from the Bolshevik Revolution
named Madame Valabhji.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:41.963 align:middle line:84%
And when she died,
her family said,

00:39:41.963 --> 00:39:43.880 align:middle line:84%
please take whatever you
like from her estate,

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:48.530 align:middle line:84%
and I took her famed pendulum
she was given by a radionics

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:50.690 align:middle line:84%
practitioner in
Paris in the '40s.

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And she used that
throughout her children's

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:56.660 align:middle line:84%
upbringing to diagnose
allergies to food

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.410 align:middle line:90%
and simple things like this.

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:01.010 align:middle line:84%
So where along that
line of thinking

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:03.710 align:middle line:84%
would you suggest the
average person might just

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:07.220 align:middle line:84%
start learning how to
develop through divination

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.960 align:middle line:90%
their own intuition with health?

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: I love that.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.460 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Anything like that is of value,
and I can offer another course.

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:16.503 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:40:16.503 --> 00:40:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: I have a
course for everyone,

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:20.650 align:middle line:84%
and it's called The Medical
Intuition for Healing and Self

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:21.450 align:middle line:90%
Care.

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, perfect.

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:23.290 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:25.250 align:middle line:84%
These are, I would
say, fundamental tools

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:27.680 align:middle line:84%
in medical intuition
where you can develop

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:31.400 align:middle line:84%
that internal visual, so
to speak, for your body,

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:34.200 align:middle line:84%
and for your energy, and
for what works for you.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.760 align:middle line:84%
So I have students that come out
of that workshop, which is now

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:42.890 align:middle line:84%
going to be an online self-study
program, where anyone can learn

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:46.700 align:middle line:84%
how to ground their energy,
how to work with their energy,

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.880 align:middle line:84%
and then how to look
inside themselves to see

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.030 align:middle line:90%
what's going on.

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:53.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the stories that
come out of that workshop

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:56.000 align:middle line:84%
and that program are
hilarious and wonderful.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's wonderful.

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're about
out of time, but I

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:02.150 align:middle line:84%
guess one thing I want to take
away here that everybody can do

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:03.410 align:middle line:90%
is look for sources--

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:07.280 align:middle line:84%
I heard you-- look for the
sources of chaos and try to move

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.990 align:middle line:90%
away from transform--

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:10.040 align:middle line:90%
stop that.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:10.967 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:10.967 --> 00:41:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Just stop that.

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Just stop that.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, find out where your
life is out of balance

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:19.160 align:middle line:84%
and find the balance
there because these

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:22.350 align:middle line:84%
are direct lines to physical,
emotional, mental, spiritual

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:23.150 align:middle line:90%
health.

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:24.490 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Yeah.

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
breathe before eating.

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Make it a little bit of
a more sacred process

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:31.675 align:middle line:84%
than just slamming it down while
you're checking your email.

00:41:31.675 --> 00:41:33.425 align:middle line:84%
>> COLTER: That's a
great piece of advice.

00:41:33.425 --> 00:41:34.400 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Wendie,
thank you so much,

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:38.968 align:middle line:84%
and I'll be looking forward
to hearing how this new study

00:41:38.968 --> 00:41:40.010 align:middle line:90%
that's underway is going.

00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>> COLTER: Absolutely.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wonderful.

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Again, Wendie's book is
titled "Essentials of Medical

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Intuition, A Visionary
Path to Wellness."

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.890 align:middle line:84%

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on "Open Minds."
