00:00:27.157 --> 00:00:29.240 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: We all
love a good ghost story,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.369 align:middle line:10%
so imagine hearing ghosts
in their own voices.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.710 align:middle line:10%
Michael Esposito has
made a scientific study

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.550 align:middle line:10%
of picking up voices of
disincarnate entities

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.680 align:middle line:10%
in other frequency ranges.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Highly skilled in
audio recording,

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.880 align:middle line:84%
he has an amazing collection
of these voice prints.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And he's with us today to
speak about the phenomena.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's an
amazing phenomenon.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.210 align:middle line:84%
We all every now
and then think we're

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.720 align:middle line:84%
hearing something
in the background,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.550 align:middle line:84%
but you've actually been able
to prove it by picking it up.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.284 align:middle line:84%
And off camera
just a second ago,

00:00:58.284 --> 00:00:59.700 align:middle line:84%
we were talking
about the intrigue

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.769 align:middle line:84%
we all have with the notion
of ghosts from the time

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:03.560 align:middle line:90%
we're a little kid.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking about some
of the ghostly things we do.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.240 align:middle line:90%
Please share.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MICHAEL ESPOSITO: Yeah.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.690 align:middle line:10%
You know, you had
mentioned when we

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.180 align:middle line:10%
were children, some
of the games we

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.890 align:middle line:10%
used to play that would
deal very much with the idea

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.800 align:middle line:10%
of-- mystery of what's beyond.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So we're captivated,
even at a very early age,

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.246 align:middle line:84%
when basically our whole
lives are ahead of us.

00:01:22.246 --> 00:01:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.328 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: We're
still captivated,

00:01:24.328 --> 00:01:26.350 align:middle line:90%
but what comes on after this?

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.490 align:middle line:90%
Where do we go from here?

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.600 align:middle line:90%
What happens after this?

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.641 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you played
a particularly beastly

00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:32.750 align:middle line:84%
little game that had you
sleeping on your stomach

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.892 align:middle line:84%
for years I mean,
this stuff goes deep.

00:01:34.892 --> 00:01:35.600 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.810 align:middle line:90%
I suppose they affect you.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.380 align:middle line:84%
The Bloody Mary one, where you
say it in the mirror enough,

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.310 align:middle line:84%
you turn around-- if
she appears behind you,

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.900 align:middle line:90%
she'll stab you in the heart.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.165 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's really funny.

00:01:46.165 --> 00:01:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: For years,
I slept on my stomach,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.748 align:middle line:84%
figuring, well, if I
sleep on my stomach,

00:01:49.748 --> 00:01:52.540 align:middle line:90%
she can't stab me in the heart.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Makes sense.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.340 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going to ask you about
this, but on that same subject,

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.810 align:middle line:84%
what about playing
with the Ouija board

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.040 align:middle line:90%
when we're little kids?

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: You know, we got
one as a Christmas present

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.520 align:middle line:90%
when we were young.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And we played around
with it a little bit,

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.450 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't as
interesting as the Legos.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's boring, a little.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.740 align:middle line:84%
I know as you get
older, people play them.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.935 align:middle line:84%
When I was in high school,
I dabbled in the tarot deck.

00:02:22.935 --> 00:02:23.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.059 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:28.115 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: And I used the major
and minor arcanas of the tarot.

00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And I tried to do everything
right and everything.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And I started having a
lot of really bad luck.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.460 align:middle line:90%
Just negative things.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.110 align:middle line:84%
So I figured I would have
to burn them or whatever.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.030 align:middle line:90%
I got rid of them.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:90%
So this was in high school.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I didn't start
playing with the Ouija board

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.385 align:middle line:90%
until I was older.

00:02:44.385 --> 00:02:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I was in my
early adult years.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I didn't
quite know what to make of it.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.630 align:middle line:84%
But the thing would
take off so fast,

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.370 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't really keep my
fingers on the planchette.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.660 align:middle line:84%
It just took off,
circling the board

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.630 align:middle line:84%
until it would just
kind of go off the board

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.600 align:middle line:90%
and do its own thing.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And I never really
thought of it.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.390 align:middle line:84%
I never felt any negativity
coming from that.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.547 align:middle line:84%
But I know there are people that
do warn if you don't know what

00:03:07.547 --> 00:03:09.630 align:middle line:84%
you're doing, and you don't
know what's around you

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.370 align:middle line:84%
and what you're tapping into,
what your frequency ranges are,

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.220 align:middle line:84%
probably best not to
play with some of this.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: My research
partner, Heidi Harman, and I

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.315 align:middle line:84%
did a investigation
outside of Chicago

00:03:21.315 --> 00:03:25.280 align:middle line:84%
in Illinois that we
labeled the SS House, where

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.920 align:middle line:84%
a woman, who was-- apparently
she had three PhDs as well,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.601 align:middle line:84%
but she'd been using the
Ouija board for decades.

00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:35.725 align:middle line:90%
She was kind of antisocial.

00:03:35.725 --> 00:03:38.050 align:middle line:84%
All of her best friends
came through it.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.866 align:middle line:84%
And she named one of them
SS, or he named himself SS.

00:03:41.866 --> 00:03:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: And so this
is where we got SS House.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.230 align:middle line:84%
But she eventually got a
real boyfriend-- you know,

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.210 align:middle line:84%
got a boyfriend, and she
started getting attacked.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.520 align:middle line:84%
I've got film footage
of her back just being

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.615 align:middle line:90%
scratched into ribbons.

00:03:56.615 --> 00:03:57.573 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, goodness.

00:03:57.573 --> 00:04:00.200 align:middle line:84%
It's a very similar story
through Andrea Perron

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.450 align:middle line:84%
and her family's experience
in their house back east.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Right.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.700 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.410 align:middle line:84%
There was scratching
on the foot of the bed.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:84%
There was a door that had a
doorstop, and it slammed open.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And it embedded the doorstop so
deep in the cinder block wall,

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.709 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't even pull it out.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:18.334 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:18.334 --> 00:04:19.839 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: And the
voices were very negative.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
talk about some of the places

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:90%
you've been.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Later in this
interview, we're going

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.060 align:middle line:84%
to be playing some
of the voice prints.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.140 align:middle line:84%
We're going to kind of set
up the phenomena beforehand.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.260 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, I mean, when

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.150 align:middle line:84%
I was playing with
the Ouija board,

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.100 align:middle line:84%
I didn't play with it for very
long because very quickly,

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.420 align:middle line:90%
it-- not typed out.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.802 align:middle line:84%
It tapped out or whatever it--
what do you call it when it--

00:04:43.802 --> 00:04:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Stopped reacting?

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.680 align:middle line:90%
Or it stopped moving?

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it was reacting.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.710 align:middle line:90%
It was going over the letters.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.504 align:middle line:84%
It was creating words,
whatever that's called.

00:04:50.504 --> 00:04:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it started
creating words,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.820 align:middle line:90%
and it simply said go get a pen.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I went and got a pen
and sat with blank paper,

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.180 align:middle line:90%
and then started doing--

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Automatic writing.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -- what was
called automatic writing.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I was kind of done with
the Ouija board pretty quickly.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And then automatic writing
gave way to other things.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was, for me, the
beginning of communicating

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:10.850 align:middle line:90%
with other realms.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was always very
peaceful and positive.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.951 align:middle line:84%
I never felt anything dark,
or there were no dark messages

00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:18.700 align:middle line:90%
that came through.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.745 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't have any natural
fear of any of the phenomena.

00:05:21.745 --> 00:05:24.910 align:middle line:90%
But that isn't always the case.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: I'm amazed that
the Ouija board told you

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.620 align:middle line:90%
to get into automatic writing.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.250 align:middle line:84%
I've long time said that we all
have psychic ability-- and kind

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.900 align:middle line:84%
of like superheroes, where you
pick your particular tool that

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.880 align:middle line:90%
works for you.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Not all tools work for every
psychic structure, construct.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.014 align:middle line:84%
And some people are
very good at dowsing.

00:05:49.014 --> 00:05:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Some people are good
at the Ouija board.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Some people are good
at tarot reading.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.946 align:middle line:84%
Some people are good
at recording EVP.

00:05:56.946 --> 00:05:57.820 align:middle line:90%
There are sensitives.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.692 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We all have our
sensitivities, so to speak.

00:06:00.692 --> 00:06:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Right,
like superheroes

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.152 align:middle line:90%
with different powers.

00:06:03.152 --> 00:06:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And for
me, it was really

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.782 align:middle line:84%
interesting because
whoever the entity was

00:06:06.782 --> 00:06:08.490 align:middle line:84%
that was speaking
through the Ouija board

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.080 align:middle line:84%
was trying to set up
communication on another level.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And so once I got
the paper, I thought,

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to participate
in this consciously.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.420 align:middle line:84%
So I put my hand here,
and I went like this,

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.480 align:middle line:90%
and just didn't do anything.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.660 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't even watching.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.490 align:middle line:90%
And boom, my hand took off.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.660 align:middle line:90%
It start going.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.870 align:middle line:90%
And I felt repeat patterns.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at it
later, and it was

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.620 align:middle line:84%
doing letters it was
doing O's, E's, L's, and T

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.300 align:middle line:90%
in straight lines.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.270 align:middle line:90%
They were perfect.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.600 align:middle line:84%
One was laid exactly on
top of the other one.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.590 align:middle line:90%
That's cool.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And then the dialogue began,
and which went on for a while

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.190 align:middle line:84%
until I didn't
need that anymore.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And then I just
kind of listened.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: So the
entity that led you

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.740 align:middle line:84%
to automatically writing knew
what your psychic ability-- you

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.550 align:middle line:90%
strength was before you did.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it
was pretty crazy.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.650 align:middle line:84%
They just kind of
take me from one thing

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:57.370 align:middle line:90%
to the next pretty quickly.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:57.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.809 align:middle line:84%
You just kind of felt,
she shouldn't be this.

00:06:59.809 --> 00:07:00.850 align:middle line:90%
She should be doing that?

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, let's make
it more efficient until we

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:03.230 align:middle line:90%
don't need anything.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: That's amazing.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:04.375 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:04.375 --> 00:07:05.390 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty cool.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I enjoyed it.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.940 align:middle line:84%
But I had other friends who
it scared the bejesus out of

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.280 align:middle line:84%
because they did get some
negative messages and such.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.494 align:middle line:90%
So just setting up.

00:07:12.494 --> 00:07:14.410 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go into
a little bit more of it

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:15.618 align:middle line:90%
and your recordings in a bit.

00:07:15.618 --> 00:07:17.980 align:middle line:84%
But how did this
originally happen for you?

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Because you're really driven
toward esoteric recordings

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.260 align:middle line:90%
on every level.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.690 align:middle line:84%
I've always been
more on, I guess,

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:31.040 align:middle line:90%
the audio science end of things.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.290 align:middle line:84%
I was building
computers from scratch.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was building
a studio computer,

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:41.140 align:middle line:84%
a mid-tower, 32-channel
German Terratec.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of
like we all do.

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah, just building
our own computers, you know?

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.823 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: So I was
building this computer.

00:07:46.823 --> 00:07:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was into modding
computers, which

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.700 align:middle line:84%
was popular at that time, and I
wanted to kick up the frequency

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:54.690 align:middle line:90%
ranges.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.690 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I wanted
the active response

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.795 align:middle line:84%
of the frequency ranges
on my recording unit

00:07:58.795 --> 00:08:02.860 align:middle line:84%
that I was going my computer
to be below 20 hertz

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.780 align:middle line:90%
and above 20 kilohertz.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And why was that?

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: It's the
normal human range.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:08.230 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: And I know
that as a recorder,

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:14.090 align:middle line:84%
it picks up all the
frequencies anyway, regardless.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.157 align:middle line:90%
It's like a blind/deaf person.

00:08:16.157 --> 00:08:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Literally, it just picks
up everything it's given.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.460 align:middle line:84%
It's just we're not able
to actively hear it,

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.950 align:middle line:84%
or the mechanics of
the recorder aren't

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:29.224 align:middle line:84%
actively able to process certain
ranges in a balanced mode.

00:08:29.224 --> 00:08:30.390 align:middle line:90%
So I was trying to fix that.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you were trying
to create very specific ranges

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.789 align:middle line:90%
that you would be able to--

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:34.080 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yes.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yes, exactly.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And so I was trying to open
up these ranges a little bit.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.710 align:middle line:10%
I ran into this work
by Friedrich Jurgenson,

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:48.120 align:middle line:10%
who was a Swiss researcher who
did work on frequency levels

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:53.380 align:middle line:10%
in the '50s, and '60s, and
'70s, and experienced something.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:59.240 align:middle line:10%
He was a Vatican painter and
archaeologist for the Vatican,

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.150 align:middle line:10%
and he was an opera singer.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:05.989 align:middle line:84%
And he discovered Electronic
Voice Phenomena for himself--

00:09:05.989 --> 00:09:07.530 align:middle line:84%
which wasn't the
first time, but he's

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.484 align:middle line:90%
one of the greater pioneers.

00:09:09.484 --> 00:09:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how
did that happen?

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.342 align:middle line:90%
Is he something he backed into?

00:09:12.342 --> 00:09:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.505 align:middle line:84%
He was taking a break, and
he was recording bird song

00:09:15.505 --> 00:09:22.430 align:middle line:84%
in his summer house in
Sweden, and captured

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:26.800 align:middle line:84%
these voices that
were talking to him

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.220 align:middle line:90%
and calling him little Friedel.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And that was what his
father used to call him.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And so he was
immediately hooked.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.412 align:middle line:10%
So I ran into the work of some
collections done by-- actually,

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:40.870 align:middle line:10%
the record label
I'm signed to now,

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.986 align:middle line:10%
Touch Records out of
London, the work that they

00:09:43.986 --> 00:09:45.736 align:middle line:10%
did with Electronic
Voice Phenomena-- it's

00:09:45.736 --> 00:09:49.890 align:middle line:10%
a experimental music label.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And they handle a lot of really
prominent European artists

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and musicians, and
specific worked

00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:03.280 align:middle line:84%
on as archivist or collections
compiled by Carl Michael von

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Hausswolff out of
Stockholm and Leif Elggren,

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle line:90%
also out of Stockholm.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Raymond Cass out of
England, and Jurgenson,

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:84%
and Constantine [INAUDIBLE],
who's Latvian, of these EVP.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.086 align:middle line:84%
So I started to listen to
them, and one of the issues

00:10:20.086 --> 00:10:20.710 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't get.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:21.540 align:middle line:90%
It was sold out.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So I contacted the label, and
we arranged a new release of it,

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.680 align:middle line:84%
of the record, so I
could get a copy of it.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.290 align:middle line:84%
So we put out a
new edition of it.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.850 align:middle line:90%
And so I started to try it.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.655 align:middle line:84%
And from the minute I tried
it, I was getting these voices.

00:10:36.655 --> 00:10:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was such a
phenomenal thing for me

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.150 align:middle line:84%
that I was able to capture
these voices that were clearly

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.065 align:middle line:84%
not there when we
were recording,

00:10:44.065 --> 00:10:45.380 align:middle line:90%
or when I was recording.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You couldn't hear?

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: And not only that,
it wasn't in the ambiance

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.300 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't some
noise from outside,

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.400 align:middle line:84%
because I was noting
special attention to room

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.800 align:middle line:84%
noises, ambient noises from
outside, possible radio waves,

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.030 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was capturing
very clear voices

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.630 align:middle line:84%
that seemed like they
were right next to me.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you said it
started from the beginning.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is from the beginning
of when you set your intention

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.145 align:middle line:90%
to record these voices?

00:11:11.145 --> 00:11:12.728 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah,
from the very moment

00:11:12.728 --> 00:11:14.200 align:middle line:90%
I started recording them.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was obviously
some kind of a conscious

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.864 align:middle line:90%
response going on--

00:11:18.864 --> 00:11:19.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yes.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.505 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --from the
beings themselves.

00:11:21.505 --> 00:11:23.440 align:middle line:84%
They knew what you
were there for.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.690 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like that's why
you had that kind of success

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:26.250 align:middle line:90%
early on.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.280 align:middle line:90%
They said, OK.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:27.780 align:middle line:90%
He's ready.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Right.

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:29.390 align:middle line:90%
He's ready to--

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's ready to hear us.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: It
could very well be.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.231 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: I've
captured some-- what

00:11:33.231 --> 00:11:38.820 align:middle line:84%
they call residual, or residual
EVP, or "Stone Tape" EVP.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.100 align:middle line:84%
But it also, the interactive
ones from the very beginning.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So they seemed to know
I was ready to do this.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about the notion

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.406 align:middle line:90%
of residual versus intelligence.

00:11:49.406 --> 00:11:50.922 align:middle line:84%
We were going to
go there anyway--

00:11:50.922 --> 00:11:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Sure.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and the
BBC-- what's it called?

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:53.800 align:middle line:90%
Stone?

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: "The Stone Tape."

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "Stone Tape."

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Was a--

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what that
means, and where people

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.980 align:middle line:90%
might be able to find that.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:06.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Around '71,
'72, maybe 3, even-- the BBC

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.300 align:middle line:84%
used to put out Christmas
shows, like little miniseries.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: And for
some reason in England,

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.340 align:middle line:84%
whenever you do have
something regarding Christmas,

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.100 align:middle line:84%
it always has to do
with ghosts and spirits.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.709 align:middle line:84%
And I guess this is probably
how they see Christmas,

00:12:21.709 --> 00:12:23.750 align:middle line:84%
or maybe it's the Dickinson
in them or something.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.305 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:26.305 --> 00:12:29.220 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Rather, the Dickens.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:34.390 align:middle line:84%
But this one particular series
was called "The Stone Tape,"

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:38.710 align:middle line:84%
and that the juxtaposition
of the whole show

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.130 align:middle line:84%
was that these
scientists were going

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.530 align:middle line:90%
to rent this English cottage.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.760 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
develop a new recording

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.640 align:middle line:84%
medium to compete
with the Japanese, who

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:53.520 align:middle line:84%
were gaining ground in new
cassette tape or something.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And the actual
building was haunted.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And they kept capturing
these images of this woman

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.210 align:middle line:90%
in these audio, this woman.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And they realized
that this was energy

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.850 align:middle line:84%
that had happened sometime
in the past that was actually

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:15.000 align:middle line:84%
captured in the porous
material of the stone.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.520 align:middle line:84%
So they realized they've
discovered their new recording

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:84%
medium had to do with the
porousness of these materials

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.230 align:middle line:84%
and how they were able to
capture this energy from ghosts

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.470 align:middle line:84%
of the past, if you will,
or images of the past.

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:30.920 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Now, why did they
make that assumption that it was

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.507 align:middle line:10%
the stone that was holding--

00:13:32.507 --> 00:13:34.340 align:middle line:10%
>>ESPOSITO: The image
kept repeating itself.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, on the stone.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:36.730 align:middle line:90%
In the stone.

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:37.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Around the stone.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:37.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Around the stone.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:38.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.048 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: This
ghost-- the workers that

00:13:40.048 --> 00:13:43.610 align:middle line:84%
were building laboratory
in this country estate

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:44.924 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't work in this one room.

00:13:44.924 --> 00:13:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.724 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: And
so they would try

00:13:47.724 --> 00:13:49.365 align:middle line:84%
and-- it was like
this ghost in there.

00:13:49.365 --> 00:13:50.820 align:middle line:84%
It keeps walking
across the hall.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:51.361 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:51.361 --> 00:13:52.760 align:middle line:90%
So this was a visual image.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.665 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: It was
a visual image,

00:13:53.665 --> 00:13:54.956 align:middle line:90%
but there was the audio within.

00:13:54.956 --> 00:13:58.760 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea is we've
got this new recording.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.940 align:middle line:84%
It's the same idea, the concept
of what these ghosts are

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.300 align:middle line:90%
being captured on.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what about
the notion of, as you

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:09.600 align:middle line:84%
said, residual
versus intelligence,

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.080 align:middle line:90%
or active intelligence?

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.540 align:middle line:84%
What is the difference
between the two?

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Well, we have
to talk about energy, then.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:17.560 align:middle line:90%
We need to talk about energy.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Yes,
it's about energy.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.370 align:middle line:84%
That was-- going to talk to you
about it a little bit later,

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:22.490 align:middle line:90%
but let's go there.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: The best I can
describe residual Electronic

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Voice Phenomena is the energy
you feel that you might have

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.850 align:middle line:84%
walked into a room just
after two people had

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:35.846 align:middle line:90%
a really horrible fight.

00:14:35.846 --> 00:14:38.095 align:middle line:84%
And you walk in, and you
have that oppressive feeling.

00:14:38.095 --> 00:14:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know
what happened in there.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:42.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: You weren't
there for the fight,

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:44.810 align:middle line:90%
but you feel the oppressiveness.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.936 align:middle line:84%
You feel the
thickness in the room.

00:14:47.936 --> 00:14:50.455 align:middle line:84%
You knew something
happened there.

00:14:50.455 --> 00:14:53.940 align:middle line:84%
That energy is the
same energy that,

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.640 align:middle line:84%
at another time
or another place,

00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:00.870 align:middle line:84%
could be a residual EVP or a
residual visual apparition,

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:01.479 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:15:01.479 --> 00:15:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: And one
of my colleagues

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.220 align:middle line:84%
I used to work with
a long time ago,

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.130 align:middle line:84%
he used to know this house
where this man murdered

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:12.680 align:middle line:90%
his entire family.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And he would go on
the exact anniversary,

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and the time and date-- he
had all the information--

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:21.430 align:middle line:84%
and record on the front
porch, and would almost always

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:26.150 align:middle line:84%
get sounds of screaming
and horrible sounds,

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.370 align:middle line:84%
because he knew
when to expect them.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's also some
atmospheric, and maybe even

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:41.648 align:middle line:84%
solar factors that come into
play here, as far as-- I

00:15:41.648 --> 00:15:43.544 align:middle line:90%
used to be a commodity broker.

00:15:43.544 --> 00:15:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And when I was a
commodity broker,

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.876 align:middle line:84%
we used to trade grains
based on "The Farmer's

00:15:46.876 --> 00:15:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Almanac" on the tides coming
in and out and the moon phases.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.850 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people believe
in that kind of gravity

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:54.405 align:middle line:90%
in that kind of situation.

00:15:54.405 --> 00:15:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think a lot of the
residual EVP and stuff, when

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.885 align:middle line:84%
the atmospheric pressure,
the atmospheric situation

00:16:00.885 --> 00:16:02.157 align:middle line:90%
is just right, when the--

00:16:02.157 --> 00:16:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it makes
sense, because when

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:05.850 align:middle line:84%
you're having to
use pressurization

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:07.410 align:middle line:90%
to get the files to begin with.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Right.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:08.239 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:08.239 --> 00:16:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's also based on
energy, and if energy

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.410 align:middle line:90%
is either resting or kinetic.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:14.990 align:middle line:90%
So it can never be destroyed.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:16.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's either
resting or kinetic,

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.790 align:middle line:84%
that it would make sense that
under the same conditions that

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.487 align:middle line:84%
was kinetic the last time,
or active, it would be again.

00:16:23.487 --> 00:16:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, could
this be something

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.850 align:middle line:84%
that's affected by
something as ordinary

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.500 align:middle line:90%
as barometric pressure?

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Absolutely.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:31.200 align:middle line:90%
No, absolutely.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Barometric pressure,
temperature.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what would be
more ideal barometric pressure

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.569 align:middle line:90%
ranges to pick up these EVPs?

00:16:39.569 --> 00:16:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: I would
imagine-- and it's just

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.000 align:middle line:90%
a theory I develop [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.160 align:middle line:90%
We don't know anything.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.600 align:middle line:84%
We're only creating
postulates and theorems,

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:53.320 align:middle line:84%
and trying to collect enough
evidence in a contained

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.320 align:middle line:84%
environment, where
someone down the line

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.880 align:middle line:84%
will come up with
the answers, not us.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:05.140 align:middle line:84%
But my ideas would be that there
would be atmospheric situations

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:10.560 align:middle line:84%
that emulated the same ones
when the action initially

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.079 align:middle line:90%
took place.

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: So there
was a rainy, stormy day

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.880 align:middle line:84%
with the high barometric
pressure the day

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:19.990 align:middle line:90%
that it happened.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Under a certain
circumstances and

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:27.010 align:middle line:84%
a certain geomagnetic
pressure, if you will,

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:28.474 align:middle line:90%
it may repeat itself.

00:17:28.474 --> 00:17:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Or may free itself
up from porous materials,

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:38.580 align:middle line:84%
like wooden floors or stone
walls, that it's settled in.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:43.350 align:middle line:84%
You realize, of course, when
you speak, binaural hearing--

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.540 align:middle line:90%
we hear in three dimensions.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.650 align:middle line:84%
We get echolocation, like
we see in three dimensions,

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.050 align:middle line:84%
because our eyes that
are at different angles,

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:52.227 align:middle line:90%
we can see in three dimensions.

00:17:52.227 --> 00:17:53.810 align:middle line:84%
If we had one eye,
we'd see everything

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.540 align:middle line:84%
flat in one dimension
or two dimensions.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:57.379 align:middle line:90%
Same with hearing.

00:17:57.379 --> 00:17:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Our first ear picks up
the original sound source,

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:03.524 align:middle line:84%
and our second ear picks up
the reflection of the echo.

00:18:03.524 --> 00:18:04.940 align:middle line:84%
When something
reflects, the noise

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:08.570 align:middle line:84%
reflects off of an object,
part of it reflects off of it,

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.070 align:middle line:84%
and part of it gets
absorbed into the porousness

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.260 align:middle line:90%
of the material.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So that part that gets
absorbed is the part

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.910 align:middle line:84%
that I'm interested
in, in residual EVP,

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:23.440 align:middle line:84%
because that's the part
that I try and figure it

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.530 align:middle line:90%
using either whole tone.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:29.950 align:middle line:84%
I've done experiments using the
whole tone, your tuning forks,

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:33.590 align:middle line:84%
or different types of
energies or waveforms,

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:38.600 align:middle line:84%
to try and regenerate or
reactivate this resting energy,

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.590 align:middle line:90%
this resting audio material.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you
speak up residual--

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:48.570 align:middle line:84%
I remember I was taking
notes on your work--

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:53.370 align:middle line:84%
is this what you correlate
to phantom limb pain?

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Is that part of that
residual effect?

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yes, exactly.

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:59.810 align:middle line:84%
There's a school in
Lausanne, Switzerland

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.320 align:middle line:90%
that does a lot of work.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.480 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a robotics
school, but they

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.630 align:middle line:84%
do a lot of work on phantom limb
pain and phantom limb movement,

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and actually discovered
that part of the brain

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle line:84%
that actually, a lot of
that phantom limb movement

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.250 align:middle line:90%
information is stored.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, the information
itself is electronic,

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.640 align:middle line:90%
so it's not in the brain.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.250 align:middle line:84%
It's actually that
low-level static electricity

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.740 align:middle line:90%
that we all carry.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.310 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is a vet
or somebody, a vet,

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.226 align:middle line:84%
has lost an appendage,
but still feels

00:19:35.226 --> 00:19:37.100 align:middle line:84%
like he can reach down
and pick up something.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or still
feels pain in it.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Or still
feels pain in it as well.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.230 align:middle line:84%
That information is
encoded by a persistence

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:50.590 align:middle line:84%
of memory of the energy
that used to be his hand.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:54.730 align:middle line:84%
So we know that we don't lose
that persistence of memory.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:20:00.470 align:middle line:84%
We don't lose that
image in our minds.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:02.621 align:middle line:84%
I really hate saying
in our minds because--

00:20:02.621 --> 00:20:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
fair to say mind.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Mind needs a new
description in that case.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Right.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.020 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, because--

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like
the intelligence

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:09.340 align:middle line:90%
that permeates everything.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah, the
gray matter in our head.

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:84%
The brain is actually
just a storage device.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: I liken
it to a flash drive.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.955 align:middle line:84%
There's no information
on the flash drive.

00:20:18.955 --> 00:20:21.455 align:middle line:84%
It's all the electricity in the
flash drive that carries it,

00:20:21.455 --> 00:20:22.372 align:middle line:90%
and it's just stored--

00:20:22.372 --> 00:20:24.538 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A processing unit,
as some people call it.

00:20:24.538 --> 00:20:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And the same school in Lausanne,
Switzerland, by the way,

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.030 align:middle line:84%
just came up with a
couple of other things

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:30.821 align:middle line:90%
they're working on.

00:20:30.821 --> 00:20:33.440 align:middle line:84%
One is that the heart
is the processing

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:38.310 align:middle line:84%
unit, cognitive processing unit,
long before the brain does.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:39.532 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:39.532 --> 00:20:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: So when people
think with their heart really do

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.060 align:middle line:90%
think with their heart.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And it acts independently
of the brain

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.890 align:middle line:90%
under a lot of circumstances.

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:50.171 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it precedes
the brain's reaction.

00:20:50.171 --> 00:20:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Before then.

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:51.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:52.240 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:52.823 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:52.823 --> 00:20:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: And a lot
of that could very well

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:58.460 align:middle line:84%
be because it's actively
acting as a cognitive processor

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:02.545 align:middle line:84%
before the brain's developed
any kind of functional ability.

00:21:02.545 --> 00:21:03.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:03.919 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:03.919 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:10%
So then let's transition
over to active intelligence

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.120 align:middle line:10%
versus residual.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Here we go.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:15.030 align:middle line:84%
In active Intelligence,
our energy

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:20.770 align:middle line:84%
has a thumbprint as unique
as our DNA or fingerprints

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:21.810 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And this very same school
just published a report

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:30.010 align:middle line:84%
talking about how when
we have DNA passed down

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:31.790 align:middle line:90%
through our generations.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.050 align:middle line:84%
When you give birth to a child,
you not only pass down DNA,

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:39.220 align:middle line:84%
but you pass down fragments
of that small level

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.060 align:middle line:84%
static electricity that
carries all that memory

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.690 align:middle line:90%
from your ancestors.

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:48.740 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of these cases of
past life memories and things

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.070 align:middle line:84%
like that could very
well be just fragments

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:54.310 align:middle line:84%
of ancestral knowledge that's
actually physically passed

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:57.770 align:middle line:84%
down through our
birth or our children.

00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:00.480 align:middle line:84%
So we have these little
fragments of memories.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.180 align:middle line:84%
As my working deals very much
with memories and fragments

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:09.860 align:middle line:84%
of memories, as well as it
does with ghosts, if you will.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Does the thinking process stop
when we die, is the question.

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:19.900 align:middle line:84%
We know that there's certain
months of residual energy.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.840 align:middle line:84%
But is there also inactive
kinetic energy that's still

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:28.920 align:middle line:84%
maintains that cognitive
processing ability,

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.600 align:middle line:90%
remembering that it could speak.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Remembering it has desires,
that it needs to eat.

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:38.060 align:middle line:84%
There's so many questions
that-- what do we retain?

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.084 align:middle line:90%
What do we give up?

00:22:39.084 --> 00:22:42.380 align:middle line:90%


00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Actually, in the work I did,
I found some reports just

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:50.360 align:middle line:84%
recently done by
some PhDs in-- I want

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.680 align:middle line:90%
to say they were in Harvard.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.420 align:middle line:84%
Might have been Harvard, or
it could have been in Yale.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.080 align:middle line:84%
But the idea was they were
looking at schizophrenia

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.830 align:middle line:90%
and schizophrenics.

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:04.130 align:middle line:84%
They claim often that
ghosts steal their thoughts

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:05.950 align:middle line:90%
or ghosts give them words.

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, that people
are telling them to do things.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Right, and the dead.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And the paper suggests that very
possibly that schizophrenics

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:19.020 align:middle line:84%
suffer from actually
having one cognitive foot

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.320 align:middle line:84%
on the living and one
cognitive foot within the dead.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That makes sense.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: And they're
flipping back and forth.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:27.790 align:middle line:84%
I did a record based on
that using recordings

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:33.450 align:middle line:84%
from insane asylums
around the United States.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.210 align:middle line:90%
And the lecture I wrote--

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I can't really
quite fathom how that goes,

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:40.360 align:middle line:90%
but what came of it?

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Well, it was
interesting because as in life,

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:44.440 align:middle line:90%
as in death.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the
confusion that you

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:52.065 align:middle line:84%
would imagine schizophrenics
have, the EVP also

00:23:52.065 --> 00:23:53.190 align:middle line:90%
carried that schizophrenic.

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I was wondering.

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
fascinating, if you

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:58.000 align:middle line:84%
were recording
someone who's going

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.860 align:middle line:84%
through their own physical
episode, so to speak,

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:04.530 align:middle line:84%
or outbursts, and then
dialing into the background

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:06.100 align:middle line:90%
of what's going on around them.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:06.780 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: To see if
there's any duality, or--

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:07.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is that what you did?

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:08.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: No, that is
not something I've done yet

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.300 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
lack of access--

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
would think that--

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.341 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: --now
that they've closed

00:24:16.341 --> 00:24:17.600 align:middle line:90%
all the asylums and stuff.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It would be
fascinating because it would

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:19.889 align:middle line:90%
bear out--

00:24:19.889 --> 00:24:21.950 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: That's a
very brilliant idea, yes.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:25.030 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: --what these people
are actually experiencing.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: I've done
the same with dream--

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:34.330 align:middle line:84%
of sleep talkers, that have
vivid dreams and sleep talk.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:37.140 align:middle line:84%
I've done some work,
live experimentation,

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.805 align:middle line:84%
with sleep talk
along the same lines

00:24:39.805 --> 00:24:41.080 align:middle line:90%
as what you're suggesting.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And was
there some evidence--

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.166 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yes.

00:24:43.166 --> 00:24:44.955 align:middle line:10%
Yes, there is interaction.

00:24:44.955 --> 00:24:46.042 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:24:46.042 --> 00:24:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, it goes back
to the schizophrenia.

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:52.080 align:middle line:84%
One of the things about
schizophrenics-- in fact,

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.380 align:middle line:84%
the whole-- excuse
me, the whole piece

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:59.720 align:middle line:84%
was done based on psychedelic
drugs, psychedelic music,

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:03.090 align:middle line:84%
and schizophrenia--
because of course, LSD,

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:05.660 align:middle line:84%
and DMT, which is
naturally occurring,

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.270 align:middle line:84%
were designed not only
to treat schizophrenia,

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:09.620 align:middle line:90%
but to emulate schizophrenia.

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:10.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: And
psychedelic music

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.040 align:middle line:84%
was designed to
imitate LSD and DMT.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.140 align:middle line:90%


00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:22.040 align:middle line:84%
I try and keep everything
very clean as far as my work,

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:28.060 align:middle line:84%
as far as a nice, solid
linking of processes

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:31.870 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't jump outside
of the realm of my field

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:33.490 align:middle line:90%
of this particular project.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote a lecture called
"The Housekeeper's Dilemma."

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And the housekeeper's
dilemma's just the housekeeper

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:44.000 align:middle line:84%
cleans her house, turns around,
and the house is dirty again.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So the housekeeper never really
gets caught up on the housework

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.570 align:middle line:84%
because every time she turns
around, it's dirty again.

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:51.801 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Now,
schizophrenics suffer this

00:25:51.801 --> 00:25:54.880 align:middle line:84%
because rational
men-- or people,

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.760 align:middle line:84%
when they find themselves
a new environment,

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.400 align:middle line:84%
they have to order
their environment

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.490 align:middle line:90%
to be able to function again.

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:03.430 align:middle line:84%
So when we pass on, when
we die and our energy's

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:05.620 align:middle line:84%
in a new environment,
that energy's

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:09.700 align:middle line:84%
going to need to be able
to order itself somehow

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.110 align:middle line:90%
to be able to function.

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, schizophrenics can never
find that order, that function,

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.980 align:middle line:84%
ability, because
they're flipping

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:21.105 align:middle line:84%
between the living and the
dead, one foot in this one side

00:26:21.105 --> 00:26:22.481 align:middle line:90%
and one foot in the other.

00:26:22.481 --> 00:26:24.106 align:middle line:84%
So every time they
turn around, they're

00:26:24.106 --> 00:26:27.070 align:middle line:84%
in an entire different
environment, structurally.

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One of the things, the
persistence of intelligence--

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:32.700 align:middle line:84%
you talk about that when
we die, this persistence

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:33.440 align:middle line:90%
of intelligence.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:38.560 align:middle line:84%
So when you're recording, do
you feel that you're generally

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.390 align:middle line:84%
interfacing more with this
active intelligence rather

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:44.680 align:middle line:90%
than residual?

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Some of both.

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:49.942 align:middle line:84%
There's quite a bit of
active intelligence.

00:26:49.942 --> 00:26:52.150 align:middle line:84%
There's the phenomenon that
I experience occasionally

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:54.442 align:middle line:90%
called voice borrowing.

00:26:54.442 --> 00:26:55.525 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Voice borrowing?

00:26:55.525 --> 00:26:56.691 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Voice borrowing?

00:26:56.691 --> 00:26:57.759 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:26:57.759 --> 00:26:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Obviously,
there are three ways

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:02.000 align:middle line:90%
we can affect an environment.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And looking at Sheldrake's
work, and that we

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:13.160 align:middle line:84%
can affect the environment
as a researcher,

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:17.290 align:middle line:84%
we can affect ourselves
going into the environment,

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:20.407 align:middle line:84%
or we can affect the
object of our study.

00:27:20.407 --> 00:27:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And those are basically
the three ways

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:25.060 align:middle line:84%
we can affect a study, affect
some sort of research we're

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.080 align:middle line:90%
doing.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:33.090 align:middle line:84%
So given that, when you
step into a situation,

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.070 align:middle line:84%
you're adding something
to the environment.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And in a lot of cases, it's our
waveform, our voices-- energy.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.070 align:middle line:90%
Waveform is energy.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: So a lot
of times, this energy,

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:48.460 align:middle line:84%
this persistence of memory
trying to communicate,

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:52.950 align:middle line:84%
a lot of time, they'll use that
active energy to manipulate.

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they come
back, mimicking your voice,

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:55.900 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:56.734 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Exactly.

00:27:56.734 --> 00:27:57.233 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:57.233 --> 00:27:58.490 align:middle line:10%
There's a really famous one--

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:00.573 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Just structuring
it with their thoughts,

00:28:00.573 --> 00:28:03.100 align:middle line:10%
or whatever you want to
call that, using your voice.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:03.995 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Exactly.

00:28:03.995 --> 00:28:04.495 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:04.495 --> 00:28:08.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's one where
you hear this-- I'm talking.

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:10.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, look,
I'm sorry, guys.

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:12.120 align:middle line:84%
I forgot some
equipment downstairs.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.470 align:middle line:90%
I have to go get it.

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:15.425 align:middle line:90%
And over me, you hear my voice.

00:28:15.425 --> 00:28:17.620 align:middle line:90%
You hear it go, roo-roo-roo.

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:20.556 align:middle line:84%
Roo, there are
maggots all over here.

00:28:20.556 --> 00:28:21.430 align:middle line:90%
And then roo-roo-roo.

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But it's your voice.

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:23.384 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah, it's my voice.

00:28:23.384 --> 00:28:24.633 align:middle line:90%
And I clearly didn't say that.

00:28:24.633 --> 00:28:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: And it's
right over my voice.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, OK.

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:35.460 align:middle line:10%
So along that line, I'm
flashing to a lecture

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.950 align:middle line:10%
I listened to many
years ago that was

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:40.650 align:middle line:10%
by the entity, the
Abraham entity.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:43.340 align:middle line:10%
Esther Hicks channels
in a group of beings

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.420 align:middle line:10%
called Abraham, right?

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:45.170 align:middle line:10%
>>ESPOSITO: Right.

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:47.720 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And they were
discussing the notion

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.180 align:middle line:10%
of communication with the dead.

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And their explanation was
that essentially that being

00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:01.810 align:middle line:84%
is reconstituted as a
result of your desire

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:03.030 align:middle line:90%
to interface with that.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:07.650 align:middle line:84%
That that human desire, or it
can be love, or expectation,

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:13.170 align:middle line:84%
any of those things will start
essentially reconstituting

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:17.150 align:middle line:84%
that entity, or bringing
that intelligence back

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:22.500 align:middle line:84%
into a cohesive form that
can be communicated with.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: I mean, not to
play Frankenstein here, but let

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:28.440 align:middle line:90%
me take that one step further.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Of course you've
heard of the theories

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:34.021 align:middle line:84%
that if an object is
not observed by humans,

00:29:34.021 --> 00:29:35.770 align:middle line:84%
that physically they
start to break apart.

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: A tree that's in
the forest that no one has ever

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:42.325 align:middle line:84%
seen doesn't exist because
its molecular structure,

00:29:42.325 --> 00:29:44.689 align:middle line:84%
or its atomic structure,
has actually--

00:29:44.689 --> 00:29:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Requires observation.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:48.063 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Requires
observation to keep together.

00:29:48.063 --> 00:29:54.190 align:middle line:84%
So in that, then yes, we do
recreate our own entities.

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, fish or whales, which
are very high intelligence,

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:01.480 align:middle line:84%
aren't trying to
capture EVP of humans.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Once human existence
is gone, then there

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.080 align:middle line:84%
will be the end of the
existence of anything

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:11.940 align:middle line:84%
that we set our
observation to, including

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.390 align:middle line:84%
our ancestry, if you will,
or persistence of memory,

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.950 align:middle line:90%
or our ancestry of the dead.

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:20.900 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right so
our need to have

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:24.250 align:middle line:10%
to have this sense
of continuity might

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:27.510 align:middle line:10%
be the very factor that's
reconstituting these entities

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:28.500 align:middle line:10%
on the other side.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.445 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: We're creating
our own living family tree.

00:30:31.445 --> 00:30:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet,
that can still

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.530 align:middle line:84%
be classified as
active intelligence.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Exactly,
because it doesn't die.

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:42.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.470 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
you and the entities,

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:48.610 align:middle line:84%
and the dialogue
with the entities,

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:52.250 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes you're
just picking them up.

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:53.830 align:middle line:84%
You're there and
you're recording it.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:57.587 align:middle line:84%
And you use something as simple
as this little device here?

00:30:57.587 --> 00:30:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: I've used all kinds.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.280 align:middle line:84%
I've got about maybe
300 of these things.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:04.397 align:middle line:84%
These are little
Dictaphone recorders.

00:31:04.397 --> 00:31:06.480 align:middle line:84%
The one thing I have found,
and people have always

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.955 align:middle line:84%
asked me about equipment--
and I've used open reel.

00:31:08.955 --> 00:31:12.360 align:middle line:84%
I've got several huge
rack-mount open reels,

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and microcassette recorders,
big cassette recorders.

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Many open reels, the
little portable ones.

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:24.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm mean, the '60s Dictaphones,
digital storage devices

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:27.870 align:middle line:90%
like this, and what have you.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:30.180 align:middle line:84%
The one thing I would
say is the cheaper,

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.430 align:middle line:84%
the better because
noise reduction.

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:33.890 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:34.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:34.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah.

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:35.690 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't want to
use Bose equipment,

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:37.370 align:middle line:84%
for instance, because they
have a lot of really good noise

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:38.320 align:middle line:90%
reduction in it.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.395 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
you be eliminating

00:31:39.395 --> 00:31:41.090 align:middle line:84%
the very frequencies
you're looking for.

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Right.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.250 align:middle line:84%
What'd signal to
a sound engineer,

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:46.230 align:middle line:84%
a typical sound
engineer, is noise to us.

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And what's noise to us
is-- or a signal to us

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:50.917 align:middle line:90%
is noise to a sound engineer.

00:31:50.917 --> 00:31:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:51.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:52.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: And So we're
anti-sound engineers.

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:55.672 align:middle line:90%
The source, yeah.

00:31:55.672 --> 00:31:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So, OK.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.930 align:middle line:90%
So now you've recorded this.

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in this
process, are you ever able

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.210 align:middle line:90%
to-- I don't know.

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:05.750 align:middle line:84%
If you're not
hearing or sensing,

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:07.000 align:middle line:90%
this might not make any sense.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.620 align:middle line:84%
But do you ever go into any
kind of dialogue with entities?

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Some are--
this is perceived dialogue,

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:17.960 align:middle line:84%
because unless you play
back the recordings,

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.800 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE], which is
sometimes we've done.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:24.207 align:middle line:84%
So we've built dialogue
over a stop-go method.

00:32:24.207 --> 00:32:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:25.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Sort
of what a-- what

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:29.240 align:middle line:84%
do we call that in
filming, in animation,

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:32.010 align:middle line:84%
when they call that
process-- the stop animation

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:32.740 align:middle line:90%
or what have you.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:32.854 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:32.854 --> 00:32:33.300 align:middle line:84%
I know what you're
talking about.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Sort of a
stop animation way, yeah.

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:38.180 align:middle line:10%
I've built
conversations that way--

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.750 align:middle line:10%
or with the help of a medium,
like work with Robbie Thomas

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:41.385 align:middle line:10%
is wonderful.

00:32:41.385 --> 00:32:42.200 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.835 align:middle line:10%
>>ESPOSITO: I love to work
with talented mediums.

00:32:44.835 --> 00:32:46.210 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Because
he can tell you

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:47.710 align:middle line:10%
what's going on
on the other side,

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:48.970 align:middle line:10%
and you can ask questions.

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And he's the
interpreter, so to speak.

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Exactly.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.160 align:middle line:90%
There's a great example of that.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:33:00.780 align:middle line:84%
We are at Rico D's, which
was a Al Capone brothel back

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:03.380 align:middle line:90%
in the day outside Chicago.

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And we're recording,
and Robbie asks,

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.480 align:middle line:90%
what is your favorite holiday?

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.030 align:middle line:90%
And there's a pause.

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.160 align:middle line:90%
And then Robbie says, Christmas.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, in between him saying
that and the response,

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.870 align:middle line:84%
you hear this
voice go Christmas.

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:19.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: So you really feel
someone who's got to talent

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:24.530 align:middle line:90%
like Robbie has--

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.010 align:middle line:90%
Lovely man.

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: --is
able to help you

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.900 align:middle line:84%
make a smoother
transition or a smoother

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.206 align:middle line:90%
purported conversation.

00:33:34.206 --> 00:33:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
less stop and go.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah, which
is interesting too,

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:40.580 align:middle line:84%
because, you know,
again, I deal a lot

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:45.270 align:middle line:84%
in quantum physics of
microsound theory in sound,

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:48.230 align:middle line:90%
and I work a lot in science.

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:53.225 align:middle line:84%
So to use a medium
for me is kind of--

00:33:53.225 --> 00:33:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He suffers a lot from
other people in investigation

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:58.640 align:middle line:90%
work too, like a medium.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.912 align:middle line:90%
But the guy is valuable.

00:33:59.912 --> 00:34:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Very.

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:01.290 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting too
is this wouldn't normally

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:07.770 align:middle line:84%
be a tool I'd use, but I think
it's important as a researcher

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:10.638 align:middle line:84%
not to disavow any
possible tools.

00:34:10.638 --> 00:34:11.513 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:34:11.513 --> 00:34:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Especially in this area.

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah,
you'd only be doing

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:15.850 align:middle line:84%
yourself and the rest of
the world a disservice.

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
entities themselves,

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:20.286 align:middle line:84%
when you're in dialogue
with them, some of them

00:34:20.286 --> 00:34:21.320 align:middle line:90%
are kind of crafty.

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:24.199 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they don't
always tell the truth.

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:26.540 align:middle line:90%
Some of them fake.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:29.480 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about some of
the behaviors of entities

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.380 align:middle line:10%
once they have your attention.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Well, there's a
famous researcher, Sarah Estep,

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:40.159 align:middle line:84%
one of the American
pioneers, who purportedly

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:42.170 align:middle line:90%
spoke with Beethoven.

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And he performed a
little concert for her.

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:47.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's obviously voices.

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:51.469 align:middle line:84%
I try not to, myself, make
any kind of, say, this

00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:52.880 align:middle line:90%
is that person or that person.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.300 align:middle line:84%
I've had too many
years' experience.

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:58.130 align:middle line:84%
If you were dying
for communication

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:01.080 align:middle line:84%
from the other side, and
someone was talking to you,

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.280 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted you
to be Joan of Arc.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'd be
whoever-- yeah, you'd be--

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.750 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Wouldn't
you be Joan of Arc?

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:07.500 align:middle line:90%
Sure. [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So they lie.

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah. [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
misrepresent themselves,

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:12.482 align:middle line:90%
just to be able to be engaged.

00:35:12.482 --> 00:35:13.232 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Right.

00:35:13.232 --> 00:35:15.802 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's
malicious, not

00:35:15.802 --> 00:35:17.010 align:middle line:90%
that that doesn't happen too.

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:19.810 align:middle line:84%
But I think that
it's more just you

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:21.310 align:middle line:90%
should take it for face value.

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:24.200 align:middle line:84%
As a researcher,
you should say these

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:28.290 align:middle line:84%
are voices, the
humanoid in form.

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:30.660 align:middle line:84%
I worked with
speech pathologist,

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:34.620 align:middle line:84%
out actually, out
of Minnesota, that

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:37.210 align:middle line:84%
helped me develop
a lot of the sounds

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:41.240 align:middle line:84%
only humans can make so
I could help separate

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.120 align:middle line:90%
and look at what I'm capturing.

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:48.280 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: So we as humans,
we have a certain structure

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:54.830 align:middle line:84%
that makes glottal stops or
tapping the t's, certain noises

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:55.950 align:middle line:90%
that can't be ambient.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:59.991 align:middle line:84%
Certain noises that can't be
anything but created by human

00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:00.490 align:middle line:90%
thought.

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:02.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:04.310 align:middle line:10%
So one question I
think that comes up

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:06.920 align:middle line:10%
for a lot of people when
you're talking about dealing

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.910 align:middle line:10%
in the realm of what were called
disincarnate entities, ghosts,

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:15.780 align:middle line:10%
and so forth, is are you
tapping into a higher or lower

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:16.760 align:middle line:10%
frequency realm?

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.269 align:middle line:90%


00:36:19.269 --> 00:36:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: That's an
interesting question,

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.070 align:middle line:84%
because I know a lot of
people talking about,

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:26.200 align:middle line:84%
well, it's a higher frequency
and it's a lower frequency,

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.470 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:31.720 align:middle line:84%
But you have to remember that
frequency is nothing more

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.015 align:middle line:90%
than a rate of oscillation.

00:36:33.015 --> 00:36:35.402 align:middle line:90%


00:36:35.402 --> 00:36:36.610 align:middle line:10%
There's no single frequency--

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:37.490 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: There's
no judgement on it.

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah.

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:38.133 align:middle line:90%
Well, no.

00:36:38.133 --> 00:36:38.420 align:middle line:90%
I know--

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:39.136 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just saying
because, you know,

00:36:39.136 --> 00:36:40.840 align:middle line:84%
they had the astral
realm is just

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.700 align:middle line:90%
slightly quicker than this.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.950 align:middle line:10%
And then the causal
realms, and all the realms

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:47.220 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness,
there is a kind

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.720 align:middle line:10%
of a layered effect of the
speed of oscillation, right?

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Well, right.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:53.600 align:middle line:10%
I always thought that
was interesting too,

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:58.040 align:middle line:10%
because a lot of the
shaman, and a lot

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:03.460 align:middle line:10%
of the medicine men in the
West-- I've done a lot of work

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.880 align:middle line:10%
with Chukchi shaman because
some of the first recordings

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:11.170 align:middle line:10%
were in 1901 and 1902
on Edison wax cylinder

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:16.070 align:middle line:10%
by Vladimir [INAUDIBLE] at a
joint US-Russian expedition

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:19.310 align:middle line:10%
to Siberia, northern
Siberia and Alaska.

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:22.537 align:middle line:84%
And they were recording
Chukchi shaman doing

00:37:22.537 --> 00:37:23.620 align:middle line:90%
an invocation of the dead.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And their ancestors?

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.628 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah.

00:37:24.628 --> 00:37:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Actually got voices in
English and Russian.

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:29.380 align:middle line:84%
When they were done,
all the Westerners

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.730 align:middle line:84%
in the village-- and
almost got laughed out

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.930 align:middle line:84%
of the scientific
community in 1902.

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:36.305 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
not surprisingly.

00:37:36.305 --> 00:37:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: But
the whole idea is

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:44.190 align:middle line:84%
a lot a shaman and
these medicine men

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:47.165 align:middle line:84%
and stuff, a lot of
the natural drugs

00:37:47.165 --> 00:37:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and whatever they
take to help put them

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:52.140 align:middle line:84%
in tune with the spirit
world, like peyote

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:58.060 align:middle line:84%
or what have you, actually
don't speed up their frequency,

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.190 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:00.730 align:middle line:90%
It slows it down.

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:01.702 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:38:01.702 --> 00:38:03.660 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm asking
that question, because we

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.400 align:middle line:84%
make the assumption that
if it's non physical,

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.410 align:middle line:84%
that it's bumping up
in frequency range.

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: It could be
higher and faster, right.

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:10.276 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But not necessarily.

00:38:10.276 --> 00:38:11.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: No.

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even if you're
working intuitively and going

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:15.470 align:middle line:84%
and getting information,
sometimes it's

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:18.810 align:middle line:84%
more to your advantage
to be able to communicate

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:22.960 align:middle line:84%
with others, to go slow
your frequencies down

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.810 align:middle line:90%
to reach into a certain range.

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So I just bring that up
because of the assumption

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.620 align:middle line:90%
that we generally have.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:29.370 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Right.

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And it'd be interesting to
take a look at the higher

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:34.350 align:middle line:84%
versus lower
frequencies actually

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:36.750 align:middle line:90%
have to do with distance.

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Whales communicate
hundreds of miles

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:42.550 align:middle line:84%
through very, very
low frequencies.

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And yet, higher
frequencies are usually

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:47.192 align:middle line:90%
considered shorter in duration.

00:38:47.192 --> 00:38:48.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
interesting, yeah.

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:50.691 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: But I'm crossing
myself here, though.

00:38:50.691 --> 00:38:53.470 align:middle line:84%
I have to be careful
because in my microsound,

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:56.400 align:middle line:84%
the tenets of microsound theory,
which is in quantum physics,

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:59.070 align:middle line:84%
says it's not true that the
shorter duration of sound

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.900 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have to be
higher frequency.

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:03.345 align:middle line:84%
It actually can be a
lower audible frequency

00:39:03.345 --> 00:39:06.210 align:middle line:84%
to humans, just not
building enough pressure

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.965 align:middle line:90%
to be heard by the ears.

00:39:07.965 --> 00:39:10.864 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a very heavy
tenant of my postulates.

00:39:10.864 --> 00:39:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:13.571 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: So I kind of
have to be careful here.

00:39:13.571 --> 00:39:16.770 align:middle line:84%
But in a normal theory
about rate of speed as far

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:18.972 align:middle line:90%
as light waves or audio waves--

00:39:18.972 --> 00:39:20.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
distance, right.

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Right.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.439 align:middle line:90%
Is distance, is the measurement.

00:39:23.439 --> 00:39:25.980 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because it's a
different type of transmission

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:27.660 align:middle line:10%
if you slow your
frequencies down

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:30.370 align:middle line:10%
in the way you get
information versus raising

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:31.490 align:middle line:10%
the frequencies up.

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:34.635 align:middle line:84%
The transmission is
experientially different.

00:39:34.635 --> 00:39:35.510 align:middle line:90%
That's what I notice.

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Right.

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:36.290 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:38.490 align:middle line:90%
And the observation is too.

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:43.570 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people talk about
Rorschach audio or pareidolia,

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:46.356 align:middle line:84%
where you have to make--
it sounds like something,

00:39:46.356 --> 00:39:46.930 align:middle line:90%
but it's not.

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:48.330 align:middle line:90%
It's something else.

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:52.570 align:middle line:84%
That's a throwback from when
we, as hunters and collectors,

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:55.070 align:middle line:84%
we had to-- or hunters
and gatherers, rather, we

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:57.860 align:middle line:84%
had to be careful to know,
when we're out hunting,

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.085 align:middle line:84%
if that something that's
going to be food for us

00:40:00.085 --> 00:40:02.780 align:middle line:84%
is something that wants
us to be food for it.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:04.190 align:middle line:90%
So we had make a snap decision.

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:06.318 align:middle line:84%
Is that a saber-toothed
tiger, or is that

00:40:06.318 --> 00:40:08.060 align:middle line:90%
a gazelle or whatever?

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:11.240 align:middle line:84%
So we had to shorten
our observation

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:14.032 align:middle line:84%
to make quicker
decisions to act upon.

00:40:14.032 --> 00:40:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For survival.

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Right.

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:16.321 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:16.321 --> 00:40:18.140 align:middle line:10%
What about the
notion of when you

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:20.875 align:middle line:10%
listen to these recordings,
entities talking

00:40:20.875 --> 00:40:23.260 align:middle line:10%
to one another, where
it's not just an entity,

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.207 align:middle line:10%
but maybe a couple having
dialogue themselves?

00:40:25.207 --> 00:40:26.040 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Chatter.

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:26.664 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:26.664 --> 00:40:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yes.

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:32.530 align:middle line:84%
The experience alone-- in
fact, interesting places.

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:35.280 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, you'll
get one, two, or even

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.470 align:middle line:84%
more entities chattering
among themselves.

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:39.210 align:middle line:90%
I find that a lot in cemeteries.

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.810 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense.

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:41.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah.

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean, oddly enough.

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.614 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:42.614 --> 00:40:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Especially
in family plots,

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and predominantly
Jewish cemeteries.

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:50.135 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of chatter.

00:40:50.135 --> 00:40:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A lot of dialogue.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.880 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah, a lot of
dialogue, a lot of chatter.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.492 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Why do you suppose?

00:40:54.492 --> 00:40:55.950 align:middle line:84%
What would be a
different journey--

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Maybe
they've got more inside.

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:57.526 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they're tighter.

00:40:57.526 --> 00:40:58.990 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they're closer knit.

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Closer clan
wise or something.

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.140 align:middle line:84%
I've been working on
this thing, in fact.

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:06.470 align:middle line:84%
This stuff I did at my
forum is based on the idea

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:09.980 align:middle line:84%
that if our energy
is passed down

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:13.050 align:middle line:84%
through the bloodline,
our persistence of memory

00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:14.990 align:middle line:84%
and our ancestral
memory, then it

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:17.290 align:middle line:84%
should be easier to communicate
with our own ancestors

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:21.240 align:middle line:84%
than separate
entities of the dead--

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:24.380 align:middle line:84%
so that our energy, your
energy with your mother,

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:26.700 align:middle line:84%
your great grandmother,
your great aunt,

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.550 align:middle line:84%
or great-great
aunt, or whatever,

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:32.779 align:middle line:84%
has a connection that you
don't have with, say, me.

00:41:32.779 --> 00:41:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And something else is
just popping up here.

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me
that belief would

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:40.120 align:middle line:84%
be a big factor in this,
the belief of the entity

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:43.130 align:middle line:84%
themselves, and
maybe even the belief

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:44.750 align:middle line:90%
of the family of the entity.

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:47.550 align:middle line:10%
So for example, if
you're in a family that

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:49.380 align:middle line:10%
believes in an
afterlife, believes

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:51.890 align:middle line:10%
in the notion of
leaving the body

00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:54.400 align:middle line:10%
and, OK, if you're Catholic,
maybe go purgatory for awhile,

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.690 align:middle line:10%
but you move onto another realm.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So you've been
released and you're

00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:01.920 align:middle line:84%
gone, versus a belief system
where it's dust to dust,

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and the only thing you have
is the memory of that person.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.530 align:middle line:90%
That's all that remains.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:10.770 align:middle line:10%
That could also, it
seem, somewhat dictate

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:13.150 align:middle line:10%
the reconstitution
of these beings,

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:14.202 align:middle line:10%
depending on your belief.

00:42:14.202 --> 00:42:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Belief
is a gatekeeper.

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:19.770 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Belief allows you
to let certain ideas or concepts

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:22.320 align:middle line:90%
in and keep others out.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And because of
that, I think it may

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:28.260 align:middle line:84%
hinder some of what we're
getting as far as communication

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:31.890 align:middle line:84%
or whatever based on
their belief structure.

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:38.160 align:middle line:10%
I did a investigation
in Rome near the Vatican

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.550 align:middle line:10%
at a Catholic Church
and museum called

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:42.530 align:middle line:10%
Museum of Purgatory Souls.

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:46.060 align:middle line:10%
Now, these objects were
all captured and found,

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:49.430 align:middle line:10%
collected in the
1300, 1400, 1500s

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:52.970 align:middle line:10%
by a priest who
actually collected them

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:55.770 align:middle line:10%
between the late
1800s, early 1900s,

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:57.940 align:middle line:10%
where he actually
died in his museum.

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:00.180 align:middle line:84%
But they're all pieces of
carbon, pieces of wood,

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:05.920 align:middle line:84%
that have symbols of crosses
or handprints burnt into them,

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.014 align:middle line:90%
which usually accompanied--

00:43:08.014 --> 00:43:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like the
Shroud of Turin, or--

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.263 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah,
very much like that.

00:43:11.263 --> 00:43:16.780 align:middle line:84%
But they usually accompanied
a apparition of someone

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:19.910 align:middle line:84%
to either a clergy
person or a family member

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:22.459 align:middle line:84%
requesting prayers to help
get them out of what they

00:43:22.459 --> 00:43:23.500 align:middle line:90%
considered the purgatory.

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:24.625 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Purgatory, right.

00:43:24.625 --> 00:43:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Exactly.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And the voices in that were
absolutely bloodcurdling.

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I bet they were.

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And speaking of voices,
we have a few more things

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:34.854 align:middle line:84%
we can talk about
that I think by now,

00:43:34.854 --> 00:43:36.770 align:middle line:84%
people are wanting to
hear some of the voices.

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:37.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Certainly.

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:37.700 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:39.386 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So let's set this up.

00:43:39.386 --> 00:43:41.135 align:middle line:84%
There are a few different
places you went.

00:43:41.135 --> 00:43:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And one place you
used to go, we don't

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.405 align:middle line:84%
have that recording right now--
maybe we'll dig it up in time--

00:43:45.405 --> 00:43:48.370 align:middle line:84%
was you went to a sanatorium,
the Waverly Hills Sanatorium.

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:49.745 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Right.

00:43:49.745 --> 00:43:50.550 align:middle line:90%
One of many.

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:51.717 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, one of many.

00:43:51.717 --> 00:43:52.716 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: One of many.

00:43:52.716 --> 00:43:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you kind of go
where there's a haunted effect.

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:58.500 align:middle line:90%
And one of them was Hazel Green.

00:43:58.500 --> 00:43:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us
about Hazel Green?

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Because we might-- well,
let's get back to that one.

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Let's go first to
the ladies singing

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:07.060 align:middle line:90%
because I like that one.

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: OK.

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:07.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:08.800 align:middle line:90%
Can we go to that one first?

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:11.610 align:middle line:10%
So we have a woman singing.

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And let's go ahead
and listen to that,

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:16.380 align:middle line:90%
because it's arpeggio, right?

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:17.505 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah, arpeggio.

00:44:17.505 --> 00:44:18.005 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:18.005 --> 00:44:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Separate notes of a chord.

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
it's very distinct.

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah.

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.500 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
why I thought maybe

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.670 align:middle line:84%
we should start with that one,
because there's no mistaking

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:25.650 align:middle line:90%
that as singing.

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:26.030 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Sure.

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's go
ahead and listen to that.

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:28.754 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
really important

00:44:28.754 --> 00:44:31.630 align:middle line:84%
to point out that as people
are listening to this,

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:35.280 align:middle line:84%
we're going to play each one
a few times over and over.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you can scroll back
while you're watching this

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:41.030 align:middle line:84%
and listen to them again
until you attune your ears.

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:43.230 align:middle line:84%
It's like defocusing
your vision.

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:45.810 align:middle line:84%
You have to defocus
your attunement

00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:48.350 align:middle line:84%
so that you're actually hearing
clearly what they're saying.

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:49.620 align:middle line:84%

go too far for that.

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:55.476 align:middle line:90%

The location's in
Atchison, Kansas.

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:12.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a half a block over
from where Amelia Earhart was

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:14.170 align:middle line:90%
born and raised.

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:17.436 align:middle line:84%
And it was built,
as well as some

00:46:17.436 --> 00:46:18.810 align:middle line:84%
of the other houses
in the block,

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:25.230 align:middle line:84%
by an Irish immigrant, Finney,
and later became a doctor.

00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:27.920 align:middle line:90%
And they built the house.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:31.310 align:middle line:84%
It was one the very
first houses in Atchison,

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:34.730 align:middle line:90%
the very beginnings of the city.

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And later on, in the
early '90s, a couple

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:44.080 align:middle line:84%
moved in-- a young couple,
Deb and Tony Pickman.

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very famous
story, Tony just getting

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:51.080 align:middle line:90%
scratched and shredded horribly.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.580 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it happen
a million times.

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:54.960 align:middle line:84%
I've done many investigations
with both of them.

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I've
got film footage

00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:01.270 align:middle line:84%
of him getting burnt on his
stomach and other people

00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:02.470 align:middle line:90%

>>REGINA: What happened in
that house that turned it

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:07.330 align:middle line:90%
into such a negative vortex?

00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: There's been so many
people with different ideas.

00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:12.490 align:middle line:84%
I think there's an
elemental there.

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: An elemental?

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: By elemental, not
in the Celtic or Gaelic sense

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:22.370 align:middle line:84%
of elementals, but more in the
idea of Emanuel Swedenborg's

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:24.556 align:middle line:90%
concept of a punisher spirit.

00:47:24.556 --> 00:47:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:27.870 align:middle line:84%
What we would consider
demonic in nature of sorts?

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:28.995 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: No, no, no, no.

00:47:28.995 --> 00:47:29.830 align:middle line:90%
Not demonic.

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:34.215 align:middle line:84%
Actually an entity that
was maybe angelic, even.

00:47:34.215 --> 00:47:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:35.798 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah.

00:47:35.798 --> 00:47:38.480 align:middle line:84%
It's an entity that's never
been a male or female.

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:39.590 align:middle line:90%
Never been alive or dead.

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just a pure elemental.

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:40.840 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:42.190 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Always been there.

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And Emanuel Swedenborg,
in the late 1400s,

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:50.610 align:middle line:84%
spoke to spirits of the living--
or rather, spirits of the dead

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:53.450 align:middle line:90%
and angels on a daily basis.

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And I recorded in
hi summer house

00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:58.650 align:middle line:84%
in Stockholm, where
he did most of this.

00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And one night, he
had a dream-- and was

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:04.815 align:middle line:84%
the late 1400s-- that a
spirit was choking him.

00:48:04.815 --> 00:48:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And he woke up, and this ghost
of this human was choking him.

00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And what we called this punisher
angel, a punisher spirit,

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:15.500 align:middle line:84%
came down and ripped the
spirit to shreds to save him.

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And in Japanese
animation, there's

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:22.822 align:middle line:84%
a anime called "Yu
Yu Hakusho" that

00:48:22.822 --> 00:48:24.030 align:middle line:90%
deals with spirit detectives.

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:26.530 align:middle line:84%
You know, the idea
is to keep the souls

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:29.390 align:middle line:84%
from the living and the
demons from interacting--

00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:31.220 align:middle line:84%
or the souls of the
dead and the demons

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:33.170 align:middle line:84%
from interacting
with the living.

00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And this whole
concept of these-- I

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:43.220 align:middle line:84%
liken them more to a
jail guard, or a NCO,

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.690 align:middle line:90%
like a drill sergeant.

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And they gather up
souls of the dead

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:52.100 align:middle line:84%
to keep them in line
from interacting

00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:53.766 align:middle line:90%
with humans, with the living.

00:48:53.766 --> 00:48:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: And these
become very intense places

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.124 align:middle line:84%
after a while with the
souls that build up there.

00:48:59.124 --> 00:49:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And you usually get
a lot of voices that

00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:03.160 align:middle line:90%
say things like, he's coming.

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:03.990 align:middle line:90%
We can't talk.

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:06.320 align:middle line:90%
We're not allowed to speak.

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:07.300 align:middle line:90%
He'll be mad.

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:08.570 align:middle line:90%
We can't talk around him.

00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:08.694 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:49:08.694 --> 00:49:10.340 align:middle line:84%
So there's fear
among those things.

00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: There's fear
among this stronger entity.

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And I've found it in a few
places-- not every place,

00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:19.480 align:middle line:84%
obviously, but a
few places where

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.145 align:middle line:90%
that seems to be relevant.

00:49:21.145 --> 00:49:22.491 align:middle line:90%
And again, it's speculation.

00:49:22.491 --> 00:49:23.116 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:23.116 --> 00:49:23.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:24.301 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: I don't know.

00:49:24.301 --> 00:49:27.310 align:middle line:84%
But it seems that we have
these what I call elementals

00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:30.780 align:middle line:84%
that-- its purpose to gather
up spirits of the dead

00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:33.407 align:middle line:84%
to keep them from interacting
on an active basis

00:49:33.407 --> 00:49:34.629 align:middle line:90%
with the humans.

00:49:34.629 --> 00:49:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:36.412 align:middle line:90%
But makes sense.

00:49:36.412 --> 00:49:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Which is odd
too because the Sallie

00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:40.635 align:middle line:84%
House has had such great
interaction with the living.

00:49:40.635 --> 00:49:41.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:42.706 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:49:42.706 --> 00:49:43.309 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:43.309 --> 00:49:44.850 align:middle line:84%
We're going to listen
to another cut.

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:46.224 align:middle line:10%
I believe this is
from the Sallie

00:49:46.224 --> 00:49:49.965 align:middle line:10%
House, in which the entity
is saying they don't bleed.

00:49:49.965 --> 00:49:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Right.

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They don't bleed.

00:49:51.730 --> 00:49:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: They don't bleed.

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And no one knows
what the context for this is.

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Actually, I do.

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You do?

00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:56.488 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: I do.

00:49:56.488 --> 00:49:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us
the context for this.

00:49:58.450 --> 00:50:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: We were going down
to do filming for interviews

00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:05.780 align:middle line:84%
for other TV series "A Haunting"
for their episode of the Sallie

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:06.680 align:middle line:90%
House.

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And the camera crew was
going to meet us at the house

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:11.190 align:middle line:90%
and do the interviews there.

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And when we got
to the airport, we

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.570 align:middle line:84%
got a phone call
from the camera crew

00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:18.420 align:middle line:84%
that they decided that the
walls were too white, that they

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:21.340 align:middle line:84%
were going to do them at
the hotel, the interviews.

00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And so we decided to
stop by the Sallie House

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:25.170 align:middle line:84%
before we went
over to the hotel.

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:26.700 align:middle line:90%
And I'm talking.

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling my research
partner-- I'm telling them--

00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:32.800 align:middle line:84%
you know, I hate
to tell you this,

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.439 align:middle line:84%
but these walls
are not too white,

00:50:34.439 --> 00:50:36.230 align:middle line:84%
because they're like
a horsehair thatching,

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:38.410 align:middle line:84%
so they're kind of
a grayish white.

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And then you hear this
voice go, they don't bleed.

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:44.614 align:middle line:84%
Now, later we find out that
somehow, the cameraman ended up

00:50:44.614 --> 00:50:45.280 align:middle line:90%
in the basement.

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And something very,
very horrible,

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.580 align:middle line:84%
which I won't talk
about, happened.

00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, we'll
talk about other things.

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.340 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
talk about that.

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:52.315 align:middle line:90%
Let's listen to the file.

00:50:52.315 --> 00:50:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: OK.

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:53.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's go ahead
and play it a couple of times.

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And then people can go
back and scroll back

00:50:58.170 --> 00:50:59.102 align:middle line:90%
and listen repeatedly.

00:50:59.102 --> 00:50:59.810 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Sure.

00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's an option.

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:03.138 align:middle line:10%
>>ESPOSITO: I hate to
say this, but these walls

00:51:03.138 --> 00:51:04.864 align:middle line:10%
are not too white.

00:51:04.864 --> 00:51:08.329 align:middle line:10%
>>They don't bleed.

00:51:08.329 --> 00:51:10.287 align:middle line:10%
>>ESPOSITO: I hate to
say this, but these walls

00:51:10.287 --> 00:51:12.259 align:middle line:10%
are not too white.

00:51:12.259 --> 00:51:15.620 align:middle line:10%
>>They don't bleed.

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:17.120 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And a lot
of them come out

00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:18.917 align:middle line:10%
as these whispers
in the background.

00:51:18.917 --> 00:51:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Correct.

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:20.250 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah.

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:25.386 align:middle line:84%
And you can't really get a
very good, strong location.

00:51:25.386 --> 00:51:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Like when you hear
that clip, you

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:29.510 align:middle line:84%
can hear me off to the
left of that audio device,

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:31.350 align:middle line:90%
so you know where I am.

00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:34.190 align:middle line:84%
But the they don't bleed
seems to encompass--

00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:39.100 align:middle line:10%
Now, there are people who
would go into this environment,

00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.560 align:middle line:10%
and they do get sick-- I
mean, aside from scratching

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:42.700 align:middle line:10%
and so forth.

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:46.550 align:middle line:10%
These are really energetically
toxic environments.

00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:47.800 align:middle line:10%
>>ESPOSITO: A lot of them are.

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:50.060 align:middle line:10%
As toxic as the nuclear reactor.

00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:52.107 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
let's talk about kind

00:51:52.107 --> 00:51:55.420 align:middle line:84%
of the range of some of what
happens to people after they've

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:58.020 align:middle line:84%
been there and they
leave the place.

00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah.

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:03.050 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my research
partner, Heidi Harman,

00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:06.480 align:middle line:84%
she's a-- was a good choice
for a research partner

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:10.150 align:middle line:90%
because she's a Reiki master.

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:13.990 align:middle line:84%
She's a energy worker,
studied energy healing

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:18.090 align:middle line:84%
and a plethora of other
metaphysical sciences,

00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:19.650 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And since I handle more
the scientific end,

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.720 align:middle line:84%
I usually let her
develop the work

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.197 align:middle line:90%
we do on the more holistic--

00:52:28.197 --> 00:52:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a good balance.

00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:30.905 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: It's
a great balance.

00:52:30.905 --> 00:52:31.890 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect.

00:52:31.890 --> 00:52:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And she has this idea, and we've
kind of developed the theory

00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:38.660 align:middle line:84%
together, that when
you go to these places,

00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:41.980 align:middle line:84%
you pick up bits and
fragments of these energies

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:43.360 align:middle line:90%
from everywhere you go.

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:46.110 align:middle line:84%
So as a researcher,
you're really

00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:50.040 align:middle line:84%
picking up pieces of energy
from all the places you get.

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us researchers
have been finding--

00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:55.670 align:middle line:84%
the active researchers who've
been to hundreds of places,

00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:59.380 align:middle line:84%
that they're getting cancer,
and they're getting really sick

00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:01.290 align:middle line:84%
from different things,
because they're not

00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:02.560 align:middle line:90%
clearing this energy out.

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:04.389 align:middle line:90%
They're not changing--

00:53:04.389 --> 00:53:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let that be a
warning for anyone intrigued

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:07.179 align:middle line:90%
with this.

00:53:07.179 --> 00:53:09.222 align:middle line:84%
Learn how to master your
own energy and clear it.

00:53:09.222 --> 00:53:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Absolutely.

00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:11.410 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Try and leave as much
behind as you can.

00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you have
another recording here

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:18.020 align:middle line:90%
from, again, Sallie House.

00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:19.712 align:middle line:10%
It's called "Die Here."

00:53:19.712 --> 00:53:20.670 align:middle line:10%
>>ESPOSITO: "Die Here."

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:21.100 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: "Die Here."

00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:22.683 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this will
give you a good idea

00:53:22.683 --> 00:53:24.457 align:middle line:10%
of what's going on, right?

00:53:24.457 --> 00:53:26.540 align:middle line:10%
And that's the kind of
entity you're dealing with.

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:31.468 align:middle line:10%
So let's go ahead a couple
times and play "Die Here" clip.

00:53:31.468 --> 00:53:33.424 align:middle line:90%
>>Die here.

00:53:33.424 --> 00:53:35.380 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:37.336 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:53:37.336 --> 00:53:40.759 align:middle line:90%
>>Die here. [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:40.759 --> 00:53:43.693 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:53:43.693 --> 00:53:46.140 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:48.640 align:middle line:90%
>>[INAUDIBLE]

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:52.417 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Somebody's
playing something on a laptop.

00:53:52.417 --> 00:53:53.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: But you hear the
first voice is that die here,

00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:57.990 align:middle line:90%
the-- what I call the old woman.

00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Raspy old voice, yeah.

00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:00.121 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: The old
hag, if you will.

00:54:00.121 --> 00:54:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And the other one, a
very panicked woman,

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:07.295 align:middle line:84%
over the transmissions
from the laptop.

00:54:07.295 --> 00:54:10.112 align:middle line:84%
You hear, wha-- wha--
why here, or die here.

00:54:10.112 --> 00:54:10.736 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:54:10.736 --> 00:54:10.820 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:11.460 align:middle line:90%
You hear her.

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: There's
just panic in her voice.

00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:13.523 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:13.523 --> 00:54:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>>And the state of
emotion on it was

00:54:15.070 --> 00:54:19.600 align:middle line:84%
so-- you have very
evil-sounding,

00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:22.590 align:middle line:84%
a very malicious-sounding
older woman.

00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:26.967 align:middle line:84%
And then this woman reacting
to her in just sheer terror.

00:54:26.967 --> 00:54:27.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:27.550 --> 00:54:27.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And again, we'll have
people go back and listen.

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:31.930 align:middle line:84%
That was pretty obvious,
though, that particular one.

00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:33.230 align:middle line:90%
You have many, many more.

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:35.810 align:middle line:10%
We just chose a
few because people

00:54:35.810 --> 00:54:37.780 align:middle line:10%
can go and check
in with your work,

00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:40.545 align:middle line:10%
and listen to other interviews.

00:54:40.545 --> 00:54:42.610 align:middle line:84%
You have other types
of files available too

00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:43.730 align:middle line:90%
that people can listen to.

00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Oh, yes.

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:45.196 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So yeah,
a lot of stuff.

00:54:45.196 --> 00:54:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: There's
just thousands.

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:46.546 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:54:46.546 --> 00:54:48.970 align:middle line:84%
We just picked a few to
kind of give a taste of it.

00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:51.290 align:middle line:84%
But we only have a
few minutes left.

00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:54.570 align:middle line:84%
But what about that place
we go when we're starting

00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:56.590 align:middle line:90%
to drop off into dream time?

00:54:56.590 --> 00:54:58.327 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Twilight.

00:54:58.327 --> 00:55:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, I know that
happens with me sometimes.

00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:03.500 align:middle line:84%
I'll be starting to go to sleep,
and people, little beings,

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:06.520 align:middle line:84%
will come up and tell me things,
or I'll hear things-- or maybe

00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:10.150 align:middle line:84%
be watching a family almost
like in a negative, people

00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:13.000 align:middle line:84%
talking, and listening
on their conversations.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.437 align:middle line:90%
What's happening there?

00:55:14.437 --> 00:55:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Well, it's the same.

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:17.650 align:middle line:84%
I tend to solve
most of my problems,

00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:21.615 align:middle line:84%
or come up with creative
ideas, as I'm either waking up

00:55:21.615 --> 00:55:23.050 align:middle line:90%
or as I'm drifting off to sleep.

00:55:23.050 --> 00:55:23.633 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:55:23.633 --> 00:55:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: And so our twilight
on both ends, if you will.

00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:30.410 align:middle line:84%
When we're in full sleep,
we're busy with REM,

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:35.010 align:middle line:84%
and we're actually purging
our brains and our stress

00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:37.400 align:middle line:84%
and everything through
our dream state.

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:40.210 align:middle line:84%
But that twilight, when we're
preparing to fall asleep

00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:44.847 align:middle line:84%
and when we're just waking
up is very interesting,

00:55:44.847 --> 00:55:46.430 align:middle line:84%
because our consciousness
is somewhere

00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:50.780 align:middle line:84%
between the consciousness of
the everyday world, where it's

00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:54.640 align:middle line:84%
the suppressed
consciousness, because we've

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:55.930 align:middle line:90%
got our obligations.

00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:58.754 align:middle line:84%
We've got the kids to get
to school or whatever.

00:55:58.754 --> 00:56:00.837 align:middle line:84%
Going to work, and this
problem, and that problem.

00:56:00.837 --> 00:56:05.300 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, we're inundated
with this real compression.

00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And the freedom of
our dream state's

00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:10.310 align:middle line:84%
when we're just
purging everything,

00:56:10.310 --> 00:56:12.120 align:middle line:90%
so we don't hold onto anything.

00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:13.670 align:middle line:84%
So we're in this
unique situation,

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:15.405 align:middle line:90%
where our observation is keen.

00:56:15.405 --> 00:56:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But our frequencies
are shifting as well.

00:56:17.530 --> 00:56:18.510 align:middle line:90%
Our brainwaves are shifting.

00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:20.260 align:middle line:10%
>>ESPOSITO: Our
brainwaves and frequencies

00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:21.300 align:middle line:10%
are shifting completely.

00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:25.350 align:middle line:84%
So we're in a good
position to acknowledge

00:56:25.350 --> 00:56:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and to allow in observations
of things we would usually

00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:32.380 align:middle line:84%
either suppress or
toss out at a time

00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:34.995 align:middle line:84%
when our actual frequencies
are shifting over.

00:56:34.995 --> 00:56:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:38.310 align:middle line:10%
I find that a fascinating area,
because we're actually maybe

00:56:38.310 --> 00:56:41.437 align:middle line:10%
hearing maybe some of what you
were picking up on recordings.

00:56:41.437 --> 00:56:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: In real
time, [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:43.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In real time.

00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Sure.

00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:44.485 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:56:44.485 --> 00:56:45.380 align:middle line:90%
A lot of that.

00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:46.550 align:middle line:90%
We only have a minute left.

00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:48.349 align:middle line:84%
What are you working
on right now?

00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:49.140 align:middle line:90%
What's coming next?

00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Oh, next.

00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:52.932 align:middle line:90%
Some concerts.

00:56:52.932 --> 00:56:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is this ongoing
research, by the way?

00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:56.220 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You just
keep doing this?

00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:57.053 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Oh yeah.

00:56:57.053 --> 00:57:01.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm doing a concert
for the 100th anniversary

00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:04.060 align:middle line:84%
of the Eastland
disaster in Chicago.

00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
Poland to do some work

00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:11.600 align:middle line:84%
with some vampire graves
that they found out there,

00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:13.210 align:middle line:90%
and a show, a concert.

00:57:13.210 --> 00:57:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Vampire graves?

00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:15.160 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Yeah.

00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:17.610 align:middle line:84%
The distrust for
the hills people.

00:57:17.610 --> 00:57:20.940 align:middle line:84%
They would consider
them vampires,

00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:24.300 align:middle line:84%
and would take their heads and
bury them between their knees.

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Put their mouths
full of poppy seeds,

00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:28.730 align:middle line:90%
because vampires are OCD.

00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:30.780 align:middle line:84%
So the vampire would
wake up and have

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:32.600 align:middle line:84%
to count all the poppy
seeds in his mouth

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.520 align:middle line:84%
before he could wreak
havoc on this town.

00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:37.730 align:middle line:10%
And by the time he got all
the poppy seeds counted,

00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:40.188 align:middle line:10%
it would be daylight, and he'd
have to return to his grave.

00:57:40.188 --> 00:57:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:41.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:42.800 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to be
doing recordings there.

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:43.633 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: So yeah.

00:57:43.633 --> 00:57:46.350 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, then next year,
doing the 100th anniversary

00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:48.610 align:middle line:84%
of the Cabaret
Voltaire in Zurich,

00:57:48.610 --> 00:57:50.955 align:middle line:84%
and the 100th anniversary
of the Dada art movement,

00:57:50.955 --> 00:57:53.190 align:middle line:84%
with recordings from
the Cabaret Voltaire.

00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:55.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, it sounds
absolutely fascinating work

00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:55.960 align:middle line:90%
that you're doing.

00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:56.680 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:57.470 align:middle line:90%
And we need people--

00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.602 align:middle line:90%
>>ESPOSITO: Thank you.

00:57:57.602 --> 00:57:57.810 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me on.

00:57:57.810 --> 00:57:59.935 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that are taking
the scientific approach

00:57:59.935 --> 00:58:03.000 align:middle line:84%
in doing this, as well as people
who are just directly listening

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.230 align:middle line:90%
in, like Robbie.

00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:05.480 align:middle line:90%
It requires both.

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:07.156 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate what you do.

00:58:07.156 --> 00:58:08.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Michael.

00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:10.054 align:middle line:84%
>>ESPOSITO: Thank
you for having me on.

00:58:10.054 --> 00:58:11.220 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Fascinating stuff.

00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:12.970 align:middle line:10%
