>>REGINA MEREDITH: Let's
start at the beginning.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.157 align:middle line:84%
You remember before
you were born.

00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:12.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MAREN MUTER: I do.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And the big flash that sent
me off into becoming a human.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.340 align:middle line:84%
The first time I wrote
about mitochondrial DNA,

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.253 align:middle line:90%
I think I was seven.

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:21.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] I don't know.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I think I reside, like,
halfway here and halfway there.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Between--

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Between the veil.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: I started humming
and followed the hum.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.530 align:middle line:90%
I followed the frequency out.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.740 align:middle line:84%
But I remember thinking,
oh, I need to go back,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.240 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going
to get in trouble.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: My dad would
be so mad if I die.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Exactly.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.910 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: She was in the
shower, and I opened the door,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, Misha, you're
going to die of cancer.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.230 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You wanted to
take it away from her.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: I would have
completely taken it.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
wasn't the reaction.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: No.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.280 align:middle line:84%
I do believe we all
have expiration dates,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.600 align:middle line:84%
but our spirit and our
consciousness doesn't die.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.105 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: And so if
we're fighting death

00:00:57.105 --> 00:00:58.980 align:middle line:84%
and we're fighting all
of these other things,

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.920 align:middle line:84%
then all we're doing in
our whole life is fighting.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens when you
see someone where you know,

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:84%
this is what you're
going to die from?

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.540 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.460 align:middle line:10%
Every now and then,
someone comes along

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.370 align:middle line:10%
that defies what it is to
be a conscious human being.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.500 align:middle line:90%
One such woman is Maren Muter.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.210 align:middle line:84%
I approached Maren
for this interview

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.540 align:middle line:84%
after reading her musings from
her childhood in a book titled

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.070 align:middle line:90%
"The Book of Buried Letters."

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.430 align:middle line:10%
Her letters, written between
the ages of four to 17,

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.140 align:middle line:10%
were profound in
their understanding

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.770 align:middle line:10%
of DNA, the cosmos,
frequency, nature, and love.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.900 align:middle line:84%
She says these
streams of information

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.420 align:middle line:84%
come to her from the
other side of the veil.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And now we have
her with us today.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.080 align:middle line:90%
Maren, I'm so happy.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.942 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed you
before on my site,

00:01:44.942 --> 00:01:47.400 align:middle line:84%
but this is the first time the
Gaia audience has really had

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.320 align:middle line:90%
a chance to get to know you.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.030 align:middle line:90%
And I tell everybody about you.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Now I tell everybody
about your chocolate

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.850 align:middle line:90%
too, which we'll get into later.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.150 align:middle line:84%
But first of all,
Maren, welcome.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being on the show.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.870 align:middle line:84%
And what I said was very
true, because you see life

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.989 align:middle line:84%
from another perspective, from
where your consciousness lives.

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:08.789 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Yes.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.670 align:middle line:90%
That is very true.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
it, I have to say

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.290 align:middle line:84%
in reading these letters
but also your more current

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.300 align:middle line:84%
writing you're going to
be publishing shortly,

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.640 align:middle line:84%
and just speaking with you,
getting to know you a bit,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.335 align:middle line:90%
there's a type of refine--

00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:26.460 align:middle line:84%
and I don't mean to embarrass
you, but a refinement

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.250 align:middle line:84%
and beauty that shines through
from such a place of clarity

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.410 align:middle line:84%
that it's very, very
rare, which is why I said

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.390 align:middle line:90%
what I said to introduce you.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.172 align:middle line:84%
So to let people get to
know you a little bit,

00:02:36.172 --> 00:02:37.380 align:middle line:90%
let's start at the beginning.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.230 align:middle line:84%
You remember before
you were born.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: I do.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's
talk about that,

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.500 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll get into
a bit of your childhood

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.400 align:middle line:90%
in these letters.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Sure.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.850 align:middle line:10%
Well, even in "The Book
of the Buried Letters,"

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle line:10%
I talk about my
in-utero memories,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:10%
right on the inception, and
the big flash and the big bang

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.130 align:middle line:10%
kind of firework that sent
me off into becoming a human,

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.090 align:middle line:10%
I guess.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.170 align:middle line:10%
And throughout the
development of my body,

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.217 align:middle line:10%
I was remembering different
sounds, different movements,

00:03:12.217 --> 00:03:13.800 align:middle line:10%
the tightening of
the belly, you know,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.910 align:middle line:10%
and things like that of
what my mother was doing.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.030 align:middle line:84%
But I think one of the
most interesting memories

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.270 align:middle line:84%
that I have was I remembered
my mother holding me.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was always told my
mother didn't hold me.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.550 align:middle line:84%
So I was adopted
at birth, and I was

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.490 align:middle line:84%
told that I was taken right
from the delivery room

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.910 align:middle line:84%
and basically delivered
to my adoptive parents.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.500 align:middle line:84%
But there was
something saying, nope.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.350 align:middle line:84%
I know my mother, my
biological mother held me.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.810 align:middle line:84%
And years later, I
end up meeting her.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And I actually asked her--
one of the first questions

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.670 align:middle line:84%
was, well, did you ever
have a chance to hold me?

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.180 align:middle line:84%
She says, nobody is ever
supposed to know that.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.640 align:middle line:84%
It was a mistake from
the attending nurse.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.140 align:middle line:84%
They had just switched
shifts, and they were bringing

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.735 align:middle line:90%
all the babies to the moms.

00:03:58.735 --> 00:04:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And my biological
mother was supposed

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.250 align:middle line:84%
to be taken off of
the maternity ward.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.620 align:middle line:84%
But they brought me into her
for feeding, and she held me.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And then they realized what they
did, and she said, oh my gosh.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.399 align:middle line:84%
30 seconds later,
they took you away.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:18.649 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what was your
memory of that experience?

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: My memory
of that experience

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.640 align:middle line:84%
was the sound of her
voice, the scent.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.620 align:middle line:90%
Or it was just--

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.990 align:middle line:84%
I guess it was more
energetic, and I'm

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.370 align:middle line:84%
attributing different
scents and stuff like that.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.820 align:middle line:84%
But I think it was
just the energy of her,

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.910 align:middle line:84%
it was so familiar in
utero, and then familiar

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.610 align:middle line:90%
on the exterior as well.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.470 align:middle line:84%
But when I met her, it
was really interesting.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.230 align:middle line:90%
It was very awkward at first.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.320 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] But she
made this sound.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.020 align:middle line:84%
She made this hum when she
was thinking of something.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And right then, it just
shot through my body

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.530 align:middle line:90%
like, oh my gosh.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.430 align:middle line:84%
It was like the duckling imprint
sound [LAUGHS] to follow her.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.433 align:middle line:90%
It was really special.

00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:00.350 align:middle line:90%
It was really magical.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and it's
funny you should word--

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to write this down.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.140 align:middle line:84%
It's funny you should use the
word hum, because that comes up

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.350 align:middle line:84%
repeatedly in your
musings and in your book,

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.670 align:middle line:90%
"The Book of Buried Letters."

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.070 align:middle line:84%
So you obviously weren't that
old when you were adopted out.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.870 align:middle line:90%
You were, what?

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:15.875 align:middle line:90%
Hours or a day?

00:05:15.875 --> 00:05:16.875 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Probably hours.

00:05:16.875 --> 00:05:19.160 align:middle line:84%
I think the adoption
papers and stuff were

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.850 align:middle line:84%
filed before I was even born, so
I was really adopted at birth.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
was five days old,

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.260 align:middle line:84%
they moved me from Omaha,
Nebraska, to Portland, Oregon,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.330 align:middle line:90%
where I grew up.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.320 align:middle line:84%
I had an older
sister at the time,

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.480 align:middle line:84%
and then after a few years,
we got more siblings.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.565 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was that
like, the transfer from

00:05:37.565 --> 00:05:41.180 align:middle line:84%
the familiarity of your natural
mother then to the adopted

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.320 align:middle line:90%
family at--

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.140 align:middle line:90%
well, at birth?

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: At birth.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's really
interesting, because I

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.460 align:middle line:84%
know that I'm not going to be
the only adoptive child that

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.550 align:middle line:84%
has maybe abandonment
or attachment issues.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Even at birth, we
don't necessarily

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.950 align:middle line:84%
recognize that that's
the cause until later,

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.770 align:middle line:84%
but studies have
started to show that.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.990 align:middle line:90%
And I was colicky.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.190 align:middle line:90%
I would cry a lot.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.620 align:middle line:90%
But I think looking back--

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.350 align:middle line:84%
and even at the time, I
was looking for something

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.800 align:middle line:90%
that I couldn't find.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was the
hum or the familiarity

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.030 align:middle line:90%
of the biological mother.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, my mother that I grew up
with, absolutely wonderful,

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.960 align:middle line:84%
and I was very lucky to have
the family that adopted me.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.135 align:middle line:84%
But there was always
something that was missing.

00:06:28.135 --> 00:06:29.510 align:middle line:84%
There was always
something that--

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beyond your reach.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Yep.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.730 align:middle line:90%
Just on the other side.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:33.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: And that's
very hard, especially

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.960 align:middle line:84%
because I was the only adopted
child out of the family.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.640 align:middle line:90%
Everybody else was natural.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to describe that
or to bring that up and talk

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.790 align:middle line:84%
to your parents about it, that
there's something missing.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And you want to ask
these questions, but--

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you were
so different anyway,

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:55.880 align:middle line:90%
as it was soon to be learned.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.205 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:06:58.205 --> 00:07:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: They were
probably like, oh my gosh.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.205 align:middle line:90%
What the heck did we adopt?

00:07:01.205 --> 00:07:02.005 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.320 align:middle line:90%
What do we do with this one?

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.760 align:middle line:90%
So you knew you were different.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you understood.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.972 align:middle line:84%
And you were
gathering information

00:07:08.972 --> 00:07:11.180 align:middle line:84%
that most people never have
access to in their lives.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.310 align:middle line:84%
They just-- we do,
but we don't know

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.550 align:middle line:84%
how to access it, because you
were moved over into a place

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.570 align:middle line:90%
you call the veil.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.670 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let's
talk about that space

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.710 align:middle line:84%
where you gather knowledge
information and such from.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Yeah.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, it is--

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:26.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.565 align:middle line:84%
I think I reside, like,
halfway here and halfway there.

00:07:29.565 --> 00:07:30.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] Pretty much.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:30.905 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Between.

00:07:30.905 --> 00:07:31.988 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Between the veil.

00:07:31.988 --> 00:07:33.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.020 align:middle line:84%
So I've learned that there's
different frequencies

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.880 align:middle line:84%
that my brain can actually tune
into so that I can actually

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.790 align:middle line:84%
open up information
and see infinity.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that when I was
actually very young, probably

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.690 align:middle line:90%
two or three years old.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.500 align:middle line:84%
I would start playing
around with sound,

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.710 align:middle line:84%
with these hums, and different
frequencies and vibrations.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And I learned that
I could follow them.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when I
didn't follow them,

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.280 align:middle line:84%
they would just open
up and show me things.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And I could just disappear and
not have to be in this body.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
you also actually

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.080 align:middle line:84%
basically killed yourself
at one point with them.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.940 align:middle line:84%
So share with us what
happened when you

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.270 align:middle line:90%
were trying to follow the hum.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Yeah.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:21.330 align:middle line:84%
So I was humming at
night, and my dad's office

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.890 align:middle line:84%
was on the other
side of the wall.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:25.153 align:middle line:84%
And normally, I would
knock three times,

00:08:25.153 --> 00:08:26.820 align:middle line:84%
and my dad would knock
three times back,

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:90%
and it was this kind of--

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Little
good night ritual.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Yeah.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.480 align:middle line:90%
Kind of game that we played.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.809 align:middle line:84%
And on this particular
night, I started humming,

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:36.940 align:middle line:90%
and followed the hum.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.120 align:middle line:84%
I followed the
frequency out and went

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.210 align:middle line:84%
into this incredibly
vast space that

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:50.600 align:middle line:84%
had everything from geometry
to consciousness and everything

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.400 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.817 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept going, and I
kept going, and I kept going.

00:08:53.817 --> 00:08:58.720 align:middle line:84%
I was, like, taking
myself out beyond space.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel my
heart slowing down,

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:07.810 align:middle line:84%
and I could feel my lungs
slowing down to just a whisper.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And you can kind of feel
gravity take over your body

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.330 align:middle line:90%
and press you down.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.930 align:middle line:84%
So I was feeling that, and I
was also feeling completely

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.440 align:middle line:90%
disconnected at the same time.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.120 align:middle line:90%
So I let that go.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:20.920 align:middle line:90%
I let my heart go.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.940 align:middle line:90%
I let my lungs go.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.298 align:middle line:90%
And I just said, meh.

00:09:23.298 --> 00:09:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were about three?

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: I was about three.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.040 align:middle line:90%
And I got out there.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think my dad must
have come in to check on me.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:33.552 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] But I
remember thinking,

00:09:33.552 --> 00:09:36.010 align:middle line:84%
oh, I need to go back, because
I'm going to get in trouble.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] My dad
will be so mad if I die.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:39.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Exactly.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.200 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even think about
dying, but I was just

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.492 align:middle line:90%
like, oh, I've got to get back.

00:09:42.492 --> 00:09:44.290 align:middle line:90%
So I turned around.

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like-- this
was one of the only times

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.130 align:middle line:84%
where I felt like I just kind
of had to pull myself back.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:84%
So there wasn't really a
thread or a rope or anything

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.270 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.990 align:middle line:84%
I just say that it
was kind of like that,

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:03.790 align:middle line:84%
like I was pulling
myself back into my body.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.170 align:middle line:90%
But that was due to the hum.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And then from then, I realized
that I can go out there

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and I can come
back, and I started

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.150 align:middle line:84%
practicing what I
didn't know at the time

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:90%
was a transcendental meditation.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And I have been doing
that my whole life

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:19.700 align:middle line:90%
now, since I was about three.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.023 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about the
letters, because you

00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:24.940 align:middle line:90%
started them so young.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.880 align:middle line:84%
You started them at four,
so not long after this.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.328 align:middle line:84%
What prompted you to
start writing, number one?

00:10:32.328 --> 00:10:33.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Well, I couldn't draw.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.577 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: Like, I
couldn't draw pictures,

00:10:36.577 --> 00:10:38.900 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't make
music, and I really

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:44.030 align:middle line:84%
couldn't express what I was
seeing and experiencing.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.100 align:middle line:90%
And my older sister--

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.960 align:middle line:84%
she was six years
older than I was.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So she was doing homework
and things like that,

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.885 align:middle line:84%
and I would just
go into her room

00:10:53.885 --> 00:10:56.930 align:middle line:84%
and ask her what she was
doing, and kind of looked

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.610 align:middle line:84%
at her letter books
and stuff like that.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.952 align:middle line:84%
And she showed me
how to spell my name.

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh,
that was pretty cool.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.930 align:middle line:90%
That's who I am.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:11.200 align:middle line:84%
So then I went out to the woods
and found her hiding something.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.070 align:middle line:90%
I was up in a tree.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.510 align:middle line:90%
She didn't know I was there.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.765 align:middle line:84%
And she was hiding a
cigar box with her friend,

00:11:16.765 --> 00:11:18.620 align:middle line:84%
and it had pictures
and stuff like that.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:19.660 align:middle line:90%
But I was like, oh, wow.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.060 align:middle line:84%
There must be really great
candy or something in that.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.950 align:middle line:84%
So I climbed down the
tree after they left.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:28.630 align:middle line:84%
And literally right when
I pushed the log over

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:32.320 align:middle line:84%
and I pulled the
little pencil box out,

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:84%
it was like something
opened up, and I

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.020 align:middle line:90%
knew what I was supposed to do.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I ran inside and I got
my mother's jar of buttons

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and dumped them out
into her sewing kit,

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.302 align:middle line:84%
and took the jar and a
pencil and a piece of paper,

00:11:47.302 --> 00:11:48.260 align:middle line:90%
and went up to my room.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And I went and asked
my sister and I said,

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.850 align:middle line:84%
I need to know how to
spell three things.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:52.900 align:middle line:90%
And she said, what?

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And I said, can you
spell the word dear?

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.805 align:middle line:84%
And so she spelled
the word dear.

00:11:56.805 --> 00:11:58.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but can you
put it on a piece of paper?

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.220 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yes.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, and can
you spell the word flower?

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.630 align:middle line:90%
And she said, OK.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And I said, can you
spell the word lady?

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:08.890 align:middle line:90%
And then she did.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:10.910 align:middle line:90%
And I believe I said thank you.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:11.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.200 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] But I zipped right
out and went into my room

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:19.690 align:middle line:84%
and shut the door and practiced
over and over and over again.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:21.640 align:middle line:90%
Dear flower lady.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And I would just trace
it until it was perfect.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
was for purpose?

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: That was for purpose.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.033 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The flower lady.

00:12:30.033 --> 00:12:32.550 align:middle line:84%
No, I have to say, when someone
picks this book up and reads

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:36.660 align:middle line:84%
it, first people are saying
in the chapter with the bandit

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.330 align:middle line:84%
and all this and your missing
jar of letters, it's like,

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.418 align:middle line:90%
is this her imagination?

00:12:41.418 --> 00:12:42.960 align:middle line:84%
What happened--
what's going on here?

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:44.700 align:middle line:90%
It was you.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.580 align:middle line:90%
But also the flower lady.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
flower lady for a moment.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So people have contacts
when they read this book.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:52.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Yep.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.000 align:middle line:84%
So the flower lady
was actually somebody

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.710 align:middle line:84%
that I knew from
a previous life,

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.270 align:middle line:84%
from a previous
iteration of life.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And I was writing
her my observations

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.500 align:middle line:84%
of what was going
on in this life

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:84%
and what I was seeing
in the world around me.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And pretty much as if I was at
camp and I was writing home.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us a little
bit about the flower lady,

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.950 align:middle line:84%
what you remember
about her from before.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: Well, we
lived in the woods.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And so I know that we lived
in the woods together.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.380 align:middle line:84%
She was taken when
I was quite young.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.660 align:middle line:84%
So I must have
been an early teen,

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.300 align:middle line:84%
and it was a long time
ago, because there were not

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.620 align:middle line:90%
cars or anything.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.760 align:middle line:90%
I remember horses.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.770 align:middle line:90%
And we lived next to a brook.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.890 align:middle line:90%
And these men came and took her.

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is my
memory of the ending.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was by the brook, kind of
in the trees or in the brush,

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.180 align:middle line:84%
and I watched this, and
I just stayed there.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And I literally remember hiding
and hunkering down and not

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.750 align:middle line:90%
moving for hours.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And so that-- but I
knew it was important.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:59.310 align:middle line:84%
There was something important
about our relationship.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Whether she was my mother
or whether I was just

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.900 align:middle line:84%
living with her, I
don't know the dynamic

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.010 align:middle line:90%
of that relationship.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.903 align:middle line:84%
You know, she could have
been an aunt or just

00:14:06.903 --> 00:14:08.070 align:middle line:90%
the nice witch in the woods.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:09.130 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.570 align:middle line:84%
But I remember I actually
finished that iteration of life

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:19.085 align:middle line:84%
in that shack, and I lived
to be quite old, I believe.

00:14:19.085 --> 00:14:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
lived in harmony

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:25.710 align:middle line:84%
with nature in the forest and
gathering herbs and mushrooms

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:26.610 align:middle line:90%
and flowers?

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's how the
flower lady lived,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.180 align:middle line:84%
and she must have
taught you some of that.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.763 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: Yeah, she
taught me all that.

00:14:31.763 --> 00:14:34.860 align:middle line:84%
It was just such a
natural understanding

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.255 align:middle line:84%
of how we can use
nature and what to make

00:14:37.255 --> 00:14:38.130 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:41.070 align:middle line:90%
And I do remember bartering.

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:46.200 align:middle line:84%
I do remember going with
her to barter at neighbors,

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.970 align:middle line:90%
like, way far away.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.625 align:middle line:90%
But I remember that.

00:14:50.625 --> 00:14:52.750 align:middle line:84%
There was something else
that was really important,

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:53.430 align:middle line:90%
and I forgot it, so--

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:54.513 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, that's OK.

00:14:54.513 --> 00:14:56.520 align:middle line:84%
But what about-- did she
actually bake things?

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: She did.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.020 align:middle line:90%
Pies.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:58.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to ask you.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Did the flower lady
really bake those pies?

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: She really baked pies
and she really baked bread,

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.270 align:middle line:90%
and I do remember that.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.950 align:middle line:84%
But I do remember vividly
the pies were something

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:09.750 align:middle line:90%
that we bartered.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Or if somebody happened by, we
always had something to share.

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:16.500 align:middle line:90%
And we weren't super vocal.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not that
we were talking a lot.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:19.620 align:middle line:90%
We really didn't sing a lot.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.420 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.990 align:middle line:90%
It was just quiet.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.370 align:middle line:90%
And I do remember that.

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:24.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, so now it gives a context,
because every single letter

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:31.260 align:middle line:84%
starting at age four, it was
addressed to the flower lady.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.840 align:middle line:84%
So you learned how to
obviously fashion other words

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.380 align:middle line:90%
and write over time.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And so when you were four
is some of the first-- let

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.860 align:middle line:84%
me just see what I
can find in here.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.140 align:middle line:84%
We'll pull a couple
of these stories.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to go past
the bandit part, which

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.720 align:middle line:90%
is wonderful.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.710 align:middle line:84%
It's like a bandit in the woods
and what happened with him,

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:51.090 align:middle line:90%
but that's a little bit longer.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:52.100 align:middle line:90%
And go into--

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:52.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.370 align:middle line:84%
"Dear Flower Lady,
I know I can fly.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:59.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm just not very
aerodynamic yet.

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.950 align:middle line:90%
From the dandelion, me."

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:03.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.270 align:middle line:84%
"Dear Flower Lady, I
used to actually not

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.070 align:middle line:84%
like color because
everyone was always

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.540 align:middle line:90%
asking me to pick my favorite.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.590 align:middle line:84%
So I picked yellow,
but I like all colors,

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and I don't see
them with my eyes.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:14.077 align:middle line:90%
I feel them."

00:16:14.077 --> 00:16:15.660 align:middle line:84%
So here's where we're
starting to dial

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:19.900 align:middle line:84%
into frequency, which gets much
more obvious as you get older.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.280 align:middle line:90%
So this is where you started.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.770 align:middle line:90%
So you felt compelled.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Like, after you
found these, you had

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.270 align:middle line:84%
to start writing what you knew,
what you felt in the time.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:29.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Yeah, I did.

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:32.473 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I was
very awkward as a child,

00:16:32.473 --> 00:16:34.890 align:middle line:84%
because I was kind of like one
of those puppies that trips

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.098 align:middle line:90%
over their ears all the time.

00:16:36.098 --> 00:16:39.990 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So people really
didn't see this side of me.

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And I hid it for a long time,
because I was also dyslexic--

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.610 align:middle line:90%
am dyslexic.

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And so the translation
between what I wrote in here

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:53.100 align:middle line:84%
and what people saw
publicly didn't correlate.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.810 align:middle line:90%
It didn't go together.

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a lot
of miscommunications.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And people thought then I
was lying, and I wasn't.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.440 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.099 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:06.260 align:middle line:84%
You were just seeing
from that veil.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: I was just seeing--

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.083 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Life from
a different level.

00:17:09.083 --> 00:17:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: I just saw life from
such a different place that I

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:12.470 align:middle line:90%
just--

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and to communicate or to
talk with other people

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:17.849 align:middle line:90%
was very hard for me to do.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So the real me was
writing these letters

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.150 align:middle line:90%
and basically writing home.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.579 align:middle line:84%
One of the funny things
is when we were retrieving

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:30.450 align:middle line:84%
these letters, the people
that owned my childhood house,

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.940 align:middle line:84%
they were the original ones
that actually bought the house

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.260 align:middle line:90%
after my family moved.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And they were
there for 30 years.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And just recently, the
house was for sale.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And I went up there
and told them.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.000 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I think I left
some stuff in the attic.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, you didn't
leave anything in the attic.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.230 align:middle line:84%
I said, really, I think
there's some letters up there.

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I crawled up, and
the fireplace goes up,

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.910 align:middle line:84%
and then you have the
eaves kind of butting up

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:57.990 align:middle line:90%
against the fireplace.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And between there,
there's a space,

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.370 align:middle line:84%
and there was letters in
there, and I pulled them out.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
day, the homeowner

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:05.550 align:middle line:90%
said, oh, can you come back?

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Because we want to hear
the story of the letters.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:12.450 align:middle line:84%
So we went back, and I actually
crawled up in the attic

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.940 align:middle line:84%
with her, and we went on
a hunt for more letters,

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.310 align:middle line:84%
and we actually ended
up finding four more.

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, and
here's a jar with--

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: Yeah, so this is a
jar of some of the letters.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.280 align:middle line:90%
The jar is very clean now.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: But--

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's that old lid.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:28.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: It was caked.

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:29.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:32.230 align:middle line:84%
It was caked with dirt
and things like that.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.580 align:middle line:84%
But like this one,
this particular one

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:39.120 align:middle line:84%
is just a compilation
of a whole bunch

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.660 align:middle line:90%
of thoughts that went in there.

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And then everything from
drawings to writings to I

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.010 align:middle line:90%
don't know what.

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:50.100 align:middle line:84%
But [LAUGHS] it just
goes on and on and on.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.200 align:middle line:90%
And I would take--

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were prolific, and
you had such neat handwriting.

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Depends on the time.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:01.363 align:middle line:84%
Each letter, even each age group
had multiple different forms--

00:19:01.363 --> 00:19:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'll just
put this over here,

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.590 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to be
hard to get them back in.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Sorry.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:05.933 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:19:05.933 --> 00:19:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: They had multiple
different handwritings

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:10.120 align:middle line:84%
depending on what I
was writing about.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle line:84%
So if I was in my
doctor mode, [LAUGHS]

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.130 align:middle line:90%
I would write very, very small.

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And then if I was in
poetry mode, my writing--

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Big and loopy?

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:18.585 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Big, loopy.

00:19:18.585 --> 00:19:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: And so that's--

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:20.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.397 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you were
able to touch in on all

00:19:23.397 --> 00:19:24.480 align:middle line:90%
of these different topics.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.918 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when
I was reading this,

00:19:26.918 --> 00:19:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I just thought, first of all,
the purity and sweetness of it.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.918 align:middle line:84%
But also your own
struggles, trying

00:19:30.918 --> 00:19:33.640 align:middle line:84%
to fit in a world you didn't
belong were clear there.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.270 align:middle line:84%
But there are a few
things you wrote.

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:39.010 align:middle line:90%
We'll choose a couple here.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:39.810 align:middle line:90%
Here's one.

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:41.480 align:middle line:84%
So you would have
been about seven.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.280 align:middle line:84%
"Dear Flower Lady, what happens
when the heart forgets love,

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.110 align:middle line:90%
the feeling of love?

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Can it know when love is there?

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.340 align:middle line:90%
Will the warmth return?

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Does the heart harden so
tight it's gone forever?

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.080 align:middle line:90%
Please don't let me harden."

00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So what was happening
in the field of love

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:04.300 align:middle line:90%
that was affecting you?

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: At that time, I think
I had a dream of connection.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And I was seeing a lot
of connection to nature

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:19.270 align:middle line:84%
and how humanity
harmonized with nature.

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:22.540 align:middle line:84%
But then I was also
seeing a lot of things

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.240 align:middle line:84%
on how people interacted
and treated each other.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed to me that
when people were frightened,

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.830 align:middle line:84%
when people didn't
understand something,

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:34.575 align:middle line:90%
they would shut down and close.

00:20:34.575 --> 00:20:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
you were seeing

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:36.820 align:middle line:90%
this energetically in people.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: I was just seeing it.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And I wondered at
the time, well,

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.290 align:middle line:84%
if people shut down
enough, will they actually

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:46.130 align:middle line:90%
be able to open up again?

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And for me, the marriage
between humans and nature

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:53.430 align:middle line:90%
is one in the same.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:57.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we share this frequency,
and we're weaving this tapestry

00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:59.190 align:middle line:90%
everywhere that we are.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.720 align:middle line:90%
Like, we literally can't--

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.230 align:middle line:84%
I cannot remove Regina from
that chair right there,

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:08.250 align:middle line:84%
because I can't isolate
you from your surroundings.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.860 align:middle line:84%
But if we start shutting
down, are we going

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.050 align:middle line:90%
to forget how woven we are?

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a lot of
society is shut down now.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Yeah.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:18.103 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And that's why this--

00:21:18.103 --> 00:21:19.770 align:middle line:84%
that's why I wanted
to ask you about it.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:20.677 align:middle line:90%
The very next page--

00:21:20.677 --> 00:21:22.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm only going to
read a few of these.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.390 align:middle line:84%
"When I was little, my dad
shared a piece of chocolate

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:25.190 align:middle line:90%
with me.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I wonder sometimes when
I remember it like magic.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:33.660 align:middle line:84%
I always chose chocolate when I
get the chance to get a candy,

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:37.050 align:middle line:84%
and it's always to
feel the magic again.

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like a secret that
my dad doesn't even

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.550 align:middle line:90%
know why I pick the chocolate.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:44.070 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the
same when we buy it.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not the same as
when we just go buy it.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:52.410 align:middle line:84%
The food of the gods is maybe
because the gods are holding me

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:54.240 align:middle line:90%
when I hold the chocolate."

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, this developed a lifelong
love affair with chocolate.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And you for yourself
and a handmade way,

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:06.690 align:middle line:84%
you make chocolate that
is the food of the gods.

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And I had the
privilege of having

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:10.980 align:middle line:84%
a little piece of
that chocolate,

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.780 align:middle line:84%
and I told you,
honestly, I don't

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.970 align:middle line:84%
think I've ever had a
better chocolate in my life.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:16.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like something
in you-- why?

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.510 align:middle line:84%
What was it about
you and chocolate?

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:20.645 align:middle line:84%
And what was feeding
you at that time

00:22:20.645 --> 00:22:22.770 align:middle line:84%
in your life besides your
connection with your dad?

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:23.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Yeah.

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was on
the Oregon coast--

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.990 align:middle line:84%
and I'll never forget it-- in
a little town called Neskowin.

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And they have a little
convenience store,

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.440 align:middle line:90%
and we went down there.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.970 align:middle line:90%
My dad and I walked down there.

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And we got a couple treats,
and about halfway back, he

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.940 align:middle line:84%
opened the bag and gave me
this little piece of something

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.920 align:middle line:84%
that I really hadn't
ever seen before.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.045 align:middle line:90%
And the smell was just--

00:22:48.045 --> 00:22:51.320 align:middle line:90%


00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.070 align:middle line:84%
at three-- I mean,
this is the wrong word,

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.570 align:middle line:84%
but it was almost
orgasmic, I mean,

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:56.130 align:middle line:90%
because everything opened up.

00:22:56.130 --> 00:23:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Every vessel in my body,
everything opened up.

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And when I brought
it to my mouth,

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:07.710 align:middle line:84%
it was like it transported me
to the other side of the veil.

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:09.408 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it literally
opened everything.

00:23:09.408 --> 00:23:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Truly the
food of the gods.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:12.742 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: It was truly
the food of the gods.

00:23:12.742 --> 00:23:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And I always wanted
that feeling.

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:19.800 align:middle line:84%
I never wanted to be
separated from whatever

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.350 align:middle line:84%
this connection is
to the other side,

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:25.620 align:middle line:84%
because that's for
me what's harmonic,

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and that's for me what
makes sense in my life,

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:33.003 align:middle line:84%
and that's for me how I
can process and explain.

00:23:33.003 --> 00:23:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and also, you've
helped a great number of people

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.190 align:middle line:84%
over the last couple
decades and more.

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And let's bring that
together with the chocolate.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:41.767 align:middle line:84%
One of the people
you were helping

00:23:41.767 --> 00:23:43.020 align:middle line:90%
was toward the end of life.

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.487 align:middle line:84%
And was he the CEO
of Levi Strauss?

00:23:45.487 --> 00:23:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: I believe
he was the CEO of--

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of Levi Strauss.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:50.790 align:middle line:84%
He was a powerful
man, and he was dying.

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And he had been exposed to
your chocolate at one point.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And you tell the rest of the
story when it was time to pass.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:23:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Yeah.

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:02.220 align:middle line:10%
So at the end of his
life, his oncologist

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:06.450 align:middle line:10%
was a very dear friend
of mine at the time.

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:12.500 align:middle line:10%
And I had given my friend,
the oncologist, chocolate.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And he started sharing it
with some of his patients.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And this man happened to
be one of the patients.

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:23.380 align:middle line:84%
So on his deathbed, one
of his very last requests

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:24.970 align:middle line:90%
was for this chocolate.

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:27.640 align:middle line:90%
So I make a fresh batch.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting it
overnighted to him.

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And literally, I
think it must have

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:35.290 align:middle line:84%
been the last hours of his
life, he spent with his wife

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:37.120 align:middle line:90%
and he savored the chocolate.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't
that amazing that he

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:43.000 align:middle line:84%
would have had the
presence to even request it

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.950 align:middle line:84%
when he was that close to
going beyond the veil, right?

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Yep.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:50.320 align:middle line:84%
So he was staying at the Ritz
Carlton in Sarasota, Florida.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And literally, the oncologist
drove it over there,

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.220 align:middle line:84%
gave it to the bellman who
gave it to the wife who took it

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.750 align:middle line:90%
upstairs, and that was it.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what a delicious
way for him to make that

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.200 align:middle line:90%
transition.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.350 align:middle line:84%
So it really-- I mean,
it brings up a whole--

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.840 align:middle line:84%
we all-- I mean, most of
us watching-- the people

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.880 align:middle line:84%
watching this, our friends, also
appreciate chocolate and love

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.680 align:middle line:90%
chocolate.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's a wonderful
world, because now we're

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.730 align:middle line:84%
in an era where it's being used
so creatively in so many ways.

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:22.270 align:middle line:84%
But it seems that once it
gets into kind of production,

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:25.010 align:middle line:84%
factory production, it
can still be delicious,

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:26.560 align:middle line:84%
but it's not having
that same energy

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.680 align:middle line:84%
that something is handcrafted
by someone like you has.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.230 align:middle line:84%
So it took you to
the other side.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.150 align:middle line:84%
You helped him go
to the other side,

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.760 align:middle line:84%
and you continue to
enjoy and practice

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.330 align:middle line:90%
with your own chocolate today.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you're really lucky,
a person gets a piece of it.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:42.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.190 align:middle line:84%
So let's move there,
because that's

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:46.690 align:middle line:84%
your frequency
and your intention

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and your love going into it, and
your total sense of aesthetics

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.130 align:middle line:90%
and balance.

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:53.505 align:middle line:84%
So let's move to when
you're a little older now,

00:25:53.505 --> 00:25:55.630 align:middle line:84%
there's a situation that
happened with your sister.

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:57.812 align:middle line:84%
And again, you were
seeing things about people

00:25:57.812 --> 00:25:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and blurting them out,
and your family probably

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:01.690 align:middle line:84%
didn't appreciate
your observations,

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:04.283 align:middle line:84%
which would come true from
a very young age, right?

00:26:04.283 --> 00:26:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: That's right.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.290 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:08.392 align:middle line:84%
On this particular
instance, I believe

00:26:08.392 --> 00:26:10.100 align:middle line:84%
I think I know what
you're talking about.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're
talking about your sister.

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:12.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Yeah.

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:16.060 align:middle line:84%
So my sister used
to give me a quarter

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.190 align:middle line:90%
to give her back massages.

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was a really great way
to earn money to go buy candy.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Always candy.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:23.817 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Always candy.

00:26:23.817 --> 00:26:25.180 align:middle line:90%
I had the biggest sweet tooth.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.407 align:middle line:84%
So she was laying in front
of the fire on this--

00:26:27.407 --> 00:26:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and it was a Sunday
morning, because I

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:31.460 align:middle line:84%
remember my dad was watching
"Sunday Morning with Charles

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:32.260 align:middle line:90%
Kuralt."

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was giving her
a back rub, and there

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:39.430 align:middle line:84%
was an ar-- there was
a region from her lower

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:43.210 align:middle line:84%
back to her upper thighs that
didn't feel normal to me.

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:45.880 align:middle line:84%
So pretty much, when I
would give her a massage,

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.585 align:middle line:84%
I would just pretend that I was
going through her bloodstream

00:26:48.585 --> 00:26:49.460 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And on this day,
it was different.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.830 align:middle line:90%
It was completely different.

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And I remember feeling it
just today as it was then.

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And I would pause, and she
said, Maren, keep going.

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'd be like, there's
something happening here,

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.740 align:middle line:90%
and there's something different.

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And then she kind
of got frustrated

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:09.590 align:middle line:90%
and she's like, oh, forget it.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:12.860 align:middle line:84%
But I kept hovering
over that spot.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And it really stuck with me for
about two weeks, I would say.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:19.740 align:middle line:90%
And it was just in my mind.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.330 align:middle line:90%
I was like, what is wrong?

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:22.160 align:middle line:90%
What was I feeling?

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:22.960 align:middle line:90%
What was I feeling?

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.760 align:middle line:90%
What was I feeling?

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And one morning I woke up
and I was like, it's cancer.

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And at this-- you don't really
know what cancer is, especially

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:33.320 align:middle line:90%
at 11 years old.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.290 align:middle line:90%
But she was in the shower, and--

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:38.520 align:middle line:90%


00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.167 align:middle line:90%
sorry.

00:27:41.167 --> 00:27:43.000 align:middle line:84%
She was in the shower,
and I opened the door

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.310 align:middle line:90%
and I was like, Misha.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And she looks out
and she says, what?

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:52.720 align:middle line:84%
I said-- and inside, first
of all, I want to say this.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.940 align:middle line:84%
I was hoping what
I was going to say

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.040 align:middle line:90%
is what her response would be.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm rubber, you're glue.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you say bounces
off me and sticks to you,

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:03.253 align:middle line:90%
because I would have taken it.

00:28:03.253 --> 00:28:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You wanted to
take it away from her.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: I would have
completely taken it.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that
wasn't the reaction.

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: No.

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:10.540 align:middle line:90%
And she was very upset.

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And I told her, I said, Misha,
you're going to die of cancer.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:18.347 align:middle line:84%
And she was very upset and
told me to get out, and--

00:28:18.347 --> 00:28:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It ruined
your relationship.

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:22.033 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: It pretty much
ruined our relationship.

00:28:22.033 --> 00:28:24.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not that we didn't
care or love for each other.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.620 align:middle line:90%
We just-- there was nothing--

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was too
traumatizing for her, actually.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.340 align:middle line:90%
But what happened then?

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: So as I
wrote in the book,

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:35.740 align:middle line:84%
it was just in what I
called the recipe phase.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:38.560 align:middle line:90%
So it was just barely there.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.290 align:middle line:84%
It was just barely
getting started.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And it took a few years,
six to 10 years for it

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:47.320 align:middle line:90%
to actually present itself.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And she was diagnosed
with ovarian cancer.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.870 align:middle line:90%
She fought it valiantly.

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:54.640 align:middle line:90%
She would go into remission.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.500 align:middle line:84%
She did chemotherapies
and stuff like that.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:01.900 align:middle line:84%
But I think it was about 10
years after her diagnosis,

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.610 align:middle line:84%
she passed away
from ovarian cancer.

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:06.820 align:middle line:90%
I did get to go and say goodbye.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:10.900 align:middle line:84%
We rekindled and pretty
much had the opportunity

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.660 align:middle line:84%
to say what we needed to
say, and to say I'm sorry.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And I got to wash her hair
and give her a back rub.

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And I shared chocolate,
even though she

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.440 align:middle line:90%
wasn't a big chocolate girl.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:26.440 align:middle line:84%
But she did get to
share some chocolate.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there's
so much loaded in this,

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:29.890 align:middle line:90%
we could talk for hours more.

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:30.520 align:middle line:90%
And we will.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.590 align:middle line:84%
We'll have more of these
conversations, for sure.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:35.170 align:middle line:84%
But let's look at it,
because as you said,

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.090 align:middle line:90%
this was in the recipe phase.

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, you and I have
talked on camera

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.440 align:middle line:84%
and off camera,
you know, before.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that we were
talking about recently

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:52.310 align:middle line:84%
is that people come in with
expiration dates, so to speak.

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And you have these
potential dates

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:56.540 align:middle line:84%
where everything lines up where
you can exit if you want to,

00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:00.710 align:middle line:84%
or you can continue on,
take good care of yourself,

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and say you have the will
to go, reasons to live.

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you have another
potential expiration date.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we fight with
everything in Western culture

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.110 align:middle line:84%
to avoid our expiration
dates, and we start

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:13.350 align:middle line:90%
fighting when we're young.

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:16.640 align:middle line:84%
We start instilling fear in
people when they're very young.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:20.090 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
expiration dates.

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And you have one
very dramatic story,

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:25.640 align:middle line:84%
and don't let us get away
without your explaining

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.440 align:middle line:90%
how disease starts.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And you see it from these early
phases, what it looks like

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:34.070 align:middle line:84%
and what it takes to nurture
it or how it can take over us,

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.880 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: OK.

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:37.370 align:middle line:84%
I do believe we all
have expiration dates,

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:41.030 align:middle line:84%
and there's things
that we can do

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:44.760 align:middle line:84%
to make us more comfortable
until that expiration date.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.110 align:middle line:84%
So if we got a cancer and
we weren't necessarily going

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:50.480 align:middle line:84%
to die of this cancer, even
if it went all the way down

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.960 align:middle line:84%
to stage 4, and then we
make a miraculous recovery,

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:57.530 align:middle line:84%
there's things that we
can do to lessen the pain,

00:30:57.530 --> 00:30:59.288 align:middle line:90%
lessen the impact of this.

00:30:59.288 --> 00:31:00.830 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not
going to die of it,

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:02.780 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to die of it,
no matter what you're doing.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: However,
if there's something

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.132 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to die of,
you're going to die of it.

00:31:08.132 --> 00:31:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is one
of those stories.

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is a wild story.

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: This is a wild story.

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:13.713 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People will tell
their friends about it.

00:31:13.713 --> 00:31:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: My father,
my adoptive father,

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:19.850 align:middle line:84%
was basically the Jack
LaLanne of Jack LaLanne's.

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:24.300 align:middle line:84%
We ate so healthfully, and he
worked out every single day

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.110 align:middle line:84%
and always went to the doctor
and monitored his heart

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:29.000 align:middle line:90%
and monitored his cholesterol.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.420 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, for 63 years.

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:35.720 align:middle line:84%
On February 23 at
age 63, my father

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:39.110 align:middle line:84%
went to the swimming
pool and got in the water

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:41.030 align:middle line:90%
and started swimming.

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And got out of the water,
looked at his friend,

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:48.530 align:middle line:84%
and basically said, time this,
of all the last words to say.

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And he laid back on the pool
deck and he passed away.

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:56.180 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting part of
the story is on February 23

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:58.000 align:middle line:84%
at age 63, his
father passed away.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:58.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't--
this is wild.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: And then before
then, his grandfather,

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:08.210 align:middle line:84%
at age 63 on February
23, passed away.

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:09.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
just unbelievable.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: So we all have these
little mini time clocks,

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:15.050 align:middle line:90%
and we see this scientifically.

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:17.105 align:middle line:84%
You know, we have
different proteins.

00:32:17.105 --> 00:32:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And as our cells regenerate,
they kind of shrink.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:24.140 align:middle line:84%
These little tails at the
end shrink, shrink, shrink,

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:25.850 align:middle line:90%
and then we expire.

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:28.940 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at
expiration dates,

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:31.650 align:middle line:84%
sometimes there's just not
much we can do about it.

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:33.635 align:middle line:84%
We just-- actually,
all the time.

00:32:33.635 --> 00:32:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When your
time's there, it's there.

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:36.427 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: That's right.

00:32:36.427 --> 00:32:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And I had someone tell me, well,
Merlin lived to 200 years old.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.180 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, we
can live forever

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:46.280 align:middle line:84%
and I said, well, let's
think about your statement

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.300 align:middle line:90%
here really quickly.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:52.160 align:middle line:84%
If Merlin lived to 200 years
old or 250 years old, whatever,

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.730 align:middle line:90%
did he live forever?

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:55.035 align:middle line:90%
He's-- no.

00:32:55.035 --> 00:32:56.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:00.620 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what we do,
we are an organic creature.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Our body is organic, and
it's made of the Earth.

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:04.490 align:middle line:90%
It literally is.

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Actually, more than the Earth,
it's made of the universe.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.730 align:middle line:84%
If you look at where all
the molecules were before,

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:12.500 align:middle line:90%
they created our body.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.780 align:middle line:84%
We have a little bit of
absolutely everything.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:17.720 align:middle line:84%
But because we're
organic, it has to expire,

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:23.660 align:middle line:84%
because it needs to go
back and feed basically

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:24.970 align:middle line:90%
the ecology, the--

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the ecosystem.

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And in old times, you were
just put in the ground

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.190 align:middle line:90%
and that happened.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Exactly.

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:31.470 align:middle line:84%
But our spirit and our
consciousness doesn't die.

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:33.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: So that continues.

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:38.000 align:middle line:84%
So we need to stop
pushing and creating

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.740 align:middle line:90%
so much fear on this death.

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:44.210 align:middle line:84%
If we learn to embrace it, and
we learn that it's OK to die,

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:47.960 align:middle line:84%
and that we aren't going to
be forgetting how much we love

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.590 align:middle line:84%
someone, and we're not going
to be forgetting our life here,

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:55.640 align:middle line:84%
but we get a continuation
of it, then we are actually

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.710 align:middle line:90%
going to be able to live.

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because if
we're so afraid of death,

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:01.175 align:middle line:90%
we're not living.

00:34:01.175 --> 00:34:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: We're spending
all our time, do this.

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:04.820 align:middle line:90%
We'll gain five more years.

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:06.290 align:middle line:84%
How do we know we're
getting five more years?

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:06.860 align:middle line:90%
We don't.

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:08.960 align:middle line:84%
But do this and do this
and do this and do this.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:12.389 align:middle line:84%
And we're pushing death
away, so we're fighting it.

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And so if we're
fighting death and we're

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:15.900 align:middle line:84%
fighting all of
these other things,

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.840 align:middle line:84%
then all we're doing in
our whole life is fighting.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: And that's
not-- there's

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.000 align:middle line:90%
nothing beautiful about that.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's enough
contention without having

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:25.550 align:middle line:90%
to push it away.

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:27.139 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And I happen to agree with
you on the whole notion

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.070 align:middle line:90%
of expiration dates.

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:33.679 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one
Vedic astrologer

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:37.668 align:middle line:84%
was talking to me about this and
said, well, we have multiple.

00:34:37.668 --> 00:34:39.710 align:middle line:84%
It might not just be one,
but maybe two or three.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Depending on where
we are in our life,

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:44.030 align:middle line:84%
we can choose to exit a little
earlier if we're kind of done.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Or if we have more
to do, then we

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:48.389 align:middle line:84%
have another one waiting
that we will exit on.

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And you also have
said in looking

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:55.820 align:middle line:84%
at people from the energetic
levels that most of us

00:34:55.820 --> 00:35:01.910 align:middle line:84%
come in programmed with what
we're likely going to die from.

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:02.870 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Yep.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:07.610 align:middle line:84%
So we all have
cancers inside of us.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:09.710 align:middle line:84%
We all have heart
disease inside.

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:15.180 align:middle line:84%
We all have every possible thing
to die of already inside of us

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:19.670 align:middle line:84%
at the DNA or
mitochondrial or even lower

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:23.500 align:middle line:90%
levels of your genetic makeup.

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And when we live, there
are certain things

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:33.880 align:middle line:84%
that are going to be triggering
these things to turn on.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.100 align:middle line:90%
So predis-- predispositions.

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:36.900 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.835 align:middle line:84%
I do stumble over my
words, so you're just--

00:35:38.835 --> 00:35:40.127 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, you're just fine.

00:35:40.127 --> 00:35:41.550 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: And it will
trigger those things.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.330 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it's environmental
and maybe it's biological

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:47.130 align:middle line:90%
within your body.

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or emotional.

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:48.617 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Or emotional.

00:35:48.617 --> 00:35:50.790 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to
trigger something

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:56.410 align:middle line:84%
that is going to onset the
length and this expiration

00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:57.210 align:middle line:90%
date.

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:58.312 align:middle line:90%
It's not wrong.

00:35:58.312 --> 00:35:59.520 align:middle line:90%
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.780 align:middle line:90%
It's just what happened.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's say that
you were a smoker,

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and you smoked for 30 years,
and you never got lung cancer.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:08.880 align:middle line:90%
And you're fine.

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.400 align:middle line:84%
Your lungs were--
you quit smoking,

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.250 align:middle line:84%
and everything-- you started
healing and it looked better.

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And then 10 years later,
you went to a concert

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.360 align:middle line:90%
and there was smoke everywhere.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:25.410 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, that smoke,
that secondhand smoke out

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:28.800 align:middle line:84%
there, triggered the lung
cancer that had already

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.860 align:middle line:84%
been developing environmentally,
that never showed up

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.270 align:middle line:90%
while you were smoking.

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:36.282 align:middle line:84%
But all you needed is
one more hit of smoke.

00:36:36.282 --> 00:36:37.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it
wasn't time yet.

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.115 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: It just
wasn't time yet.

00:36:39.115 --> 00:36:41.300 align:middle line:90%
But now it is, and there it is.

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
more gracious way

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:46.860 align:middle line:84%
of looking at life, to be able
to understand these things.

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And like you say,
just stop fighting it.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:49.380 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy your life.

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't mean
extreme, indulgent, woohoo!

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:55.740 align:middle line:84%
You drive 120 with a
blindfold on while I'm

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.745 align:middle line:84%
smoking, or taking, or
drinking, or whatever.

00:36:57.745 --> 00:36:58.620 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean that.

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:01.050 align:middle line:84%
It just means
living a good life,

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:02.490 align:middle line:90%
living a life without fear.

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:04.560 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk
about the recipe

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.610 align:middle line:84%
phase of when disease
is developing,

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:07.800 align:middle line:90%
because you have a really--

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.260 align:middle line:84%
you see it, and you
have an interesting way

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.790 align:middle line:84%
of working with people and
explaining things to them.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Yeah.

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:17.040 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it looks like
a garden in a sense.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:20.490 align:middle line:84%
This is making it as
very simple as I can.

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much, when I look out
and see absolutely everything

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.770 align:middle line:84%
in front of me, including us
sitting here at the table,

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:28.350 align:middle line:84%
we're part of this
incredible tapestry.

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And your tapestry is
right here, but it's

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.240 align:middle line:90%
part of this giant thing.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.790 align:middle line:90%
And below the tapestry is--

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:37.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to call the soil.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And the soil is pretty
much everything that's

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:41.410 align:middle line:90%
going on behind the scenes.

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:46.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's all this matrices and it
looks like geometric movement,

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:49.380 align:middle line:84%
and it's just glorious
underneath there.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:51.250 align:middle line:90%
And inside this soil--

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:54.420 align:middle line:84%
so underneath the top
tapestry where we're sitting

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:59.250 align:middle line:84%
is when I see illness
or when I see something

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:01.200 align:middle line:90%
that's starting to come up.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:05.160 align:middle line:84%
I can see it grow
just as a plant.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:08.220 align:middle line:84%
So when you see a
plant start growing

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.520 align:middle line:84%
and you can see the
little roots coming out

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.580 align:middle line:84%
and you can kind of see
when the stem is coming up.

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And then during that
time, you can kind of

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.328 align:middle line:84%
mute what's going
to be happening.

00:38:20.328 --> 00:38:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, if this is what
you're dying of,

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:24.387 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing we're going
to be able to do to stop it.

00:38:24.387 --> 00:38:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But if it's if--

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.512 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: If it's just
something that's happening,

00:38:27.512 --> 00:38:32.320 align:middle line:84%
we can mute and
retard that growth

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:36.450 align:middle line:84%
so it's not becoming
all over the place,

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:38.280 align:middle line:84%
and it's not taking
over, and it's not

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:42.280 align:middle line:84%
going to knock you out for
weeks or months or whatever.

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:44.970 align:middle line:84%
But once it comes up and
it starts sprouting--

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:47.650 align:middle line:84%
so now imagine it's
broken through the soil,

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:49.350 align:middle line:84%
and now it's
starting to sprout--

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:51.630 align:middle line:84%
then there's other
things that we can do.

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:56.060 align:middle line:90%
But we can reduce it, again.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:59.420 align:middle line:84%
We can-- it's almost like
mowing it down or chopping it

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:01.400 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it looks like.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.650 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't take
the root system away.

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:05.930 align:middle line:90%
It's just taking the very--

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Manifestation
and symptoms away.

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
when you see someone

00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:14.360 align:middle line:84%
where you know this
is forming, this

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.615 align:middle line:84%
is also what you're
going to die from?

00:39:16.615 --> 00:39:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: Well, I
don't tell them.

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I was
assuming you wouldn't do.

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:21.170 align:middle line:90%
There's no reason.

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:22.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: The reason
why I don't do that

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:25.670 align:middle line:84%
and I don't give timelines
when I talk to people

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:28.580 align:middle line:84%
is because I don't want
to set expectations.

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:31.370 align:middle line:84%
I want them to be able to
live and go through life

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:35.060 align:middle line:84%
and allow life to unfold
before them as it should,

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:38.840 align:middle line:84%
because that helps
create and keep

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:42.800 align:middle line:90%
this harmony of their lifespan.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:47.270 align:middle line:90%
It creates this unique--

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:48.620 align:middle line:90%
for me, it's magic.

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:52.040 align:middle line:84%
For us to be able to live here
and experience and do things,

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.810 align:middle line:90%
it is magic, and it's unfolding.

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's good or bad,
we get to be a part of this.

00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And the second you have somebody
telling you when and giving you

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:05.840 align:middle line:84%
a timeline, you stop seeing
the magic, and you stop--

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.360 align:middle line:90%
the hope kind of snuffs out.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Because we have in this
culture, in Western society,

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:16.190 align:middle line:84%
puts such a stigma on
the final, on the finale

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:18.530 align:middle line:90%
that it snuffs out hope.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:20.517 align:middle line:90%
And so that's not good.

00:40:20.517 --> 00:40:21.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's not good.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And I assumed you
would say that.

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
seems to me to be

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:29.220 align:middle line:84%
the kind of ethically
gracious thing to do.

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.447 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you can still
help people work with it.

00:40:31.447 --> 00:40:32.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Absolutely.

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like you say,
ameliorate some of the symptoms

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.120 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
suffering and all that

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.280 align:middle line:84%
without knowing what the
outcome's going to be.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.850 align:middle line:90%
That's perfectly legitimate.

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: And if
someone is-- they do

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:43.500 align:middle line:84%
know they're passing--
maybe they're in hospice

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:49.590 align:middle line:84%
or they did get walking
papers, I also work with them

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:52.320 align:middle line:84%
and help them in the
transition phase,

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.750 align:middle line:84%
and also help their families
in the transition phase.

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:57.720 align:middle line:84%
Because so many
times, I have actually

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.960 align:middle line:84%
dealt with people that have
had a loved one pass away,

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.860 align:middle line:84%
and someone had told them, if
you pray hard enough, if you

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.010 align:middle line:90%
do this, if you do that.

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And that person is saying, well,
if you do this and you do this,

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:10.440 align:middle line:84%
you do this, then you
don't have to die of this.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And what a disservice
it's doing, because then

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:18.900 align:middle line:84%
the survivors, number one, feel
like they weren't good enough.

00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And also the person
who passed away,

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:24.330 align:middle line:84%
their last moments were
feeling, I wasn't good enough.

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:25.860 align:middle line:90%
I obviously didn't do something.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's just very sad.

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's very sad.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.400 align:middle line:90%
Here's one.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.108 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think you were
a little bit older.

00:41:32.108 --> 00:41:35.830 align:middle line:84%
"Dear Flower Lady--" this
one is about mirrors, so--

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: I must
have been 12 or 13.

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 12 or 13.

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:38.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.530 align:middle line:84%
"I think there may be a reason
we cannot see our own face

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:42.490 align:middle line:90%
without a mirror.

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:44.320 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we're
not meant to focus

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.060 align:middle line:90%
on ourselves superficially.

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:48.010 align:middle line:90%
We're part of a canvas.

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:50.410 align:middle line:84%
When there isn't a mirror,
we can walk into a room

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:51.760 align:middle line:90%
and forget ourselves.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.370 align:middle line:84%
But with a mirror, people
tend to fuss about their hair.

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:56.080 align:middle line:84%
They apologize
for how they look.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.580 align:middle line:90%
They worry about their clothes.

00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.600 align:middle line:90%
They become a thing.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if mirrors
were actually windows

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:04.300 align:middle line:84%
to the landscape outside
with the Earth and the trees,

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:08.020 align:middle line:84%
with the lunar moths and with
the butterflies and the apple

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:10.510 align:middle line:84%
trees, with the rains
and lightning and the sun

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:12.040 align:middle line:90%
kissing the horizon.

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.320 align:middle line:84%
If that is what people
saw in the mirror,

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.610 align:middle line:90%
they would feel beautiful.

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:19.420 align:middle line:84%
They would feel part of
life, part of the hum.

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:22.300 align:middle line:84%
There is a reason we
don't see our own faces,

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:25.270 align:middle line:84%
because we're already
beautiful, and we're already

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:27.290 align:middle line:90%
part of life."

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And yet, how fixated are
we on looking in the mirror

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:31.600 align:middle line:90%
these days?

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Missing all the rest of it
that you're talking about.

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:35.800 align:middle line:90%
That was beautiful.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And because we just
have a little time left,

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:41.410 align:middle line:84%
I just want to say the
things you wrote on

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:45.160 align:middle line:84%
DNA were amazing, because they
were way ahead of their time.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.740 align:middle line:84%
You were talking about
the DNA inside of DNA.

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:53.050 align:middle line:84%
You also wrote on cancer and
that you saw in your mind

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:56.410 align:middle line:84%
that there will be a day
when a cancer cell can almost

00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:58.010 align:middle line:90%
be changed from the inside.

00:42:58.010 --> 00:42:58.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Correct.

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these
things have started

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:02.990 align:middle line:84%
coming to pass in
the world of science,

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:05.140 align:middle line:84%
but you were seeing this
decades ahead of this.

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Yeah.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:09.730 align:middle line:84%
I started writing
about biotechnologies

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:12.100 align:middle line:90%
in the late 1970s.

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And really, if you look at
the first cancer biotechnology

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:18.490 align:middle line:84%
experiments that we
had going on were right

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:21.200 align:middle line:90%
around 1998 or in 1989.

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.000 align:middle line:90%
One of those.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:22.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And what I wrote
about was literally

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:30.640 align:middle line:84%
being able to turn
on and off proteins.

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.040 align:middle line:90%
And then I also talked about--

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.575 align:middle line:84%
before I got to
the proteins, being

00:43:34.575 --> 00:43:35.950 align:middle line:84%
able to turn on
and off proteins,

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:38.080 align:middle line:84%
I also thought,
you know, is there

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.470 align:middle line:84%
a way that we could put
a virus inside and have

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:43.040 align:middle line:90%
the virus kill the cancer?

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: So we have two of
these things that I wrote about

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:49.390 align:middle line:84%
and I spoke about,
and now we have

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:51.790 align:middle line:84%
two of these things that
are really on the forefront

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:54.425 align:middle line:90%
right now of cancer research.

00:43:54.425 --> 00:43:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is amazing.

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:58.700 align:middle line:84%
But again, the place you go to
is the place that has access.

00:43:58.700 --> 00:43:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Correct.

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Infinite access.

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:01.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Yeah.

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
showing my friend,

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:06.010 align:middle line:84%
my oncologist friend
was actually with me

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:08.230 align:middle line:90%
when we were unburying--

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:10.480 align:middle line:84%
unearthing the letters, and
we started reading these.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And I remember for me,
it all makes sense.

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:17.110 align:middle line:84%
For me it's not like, oh, this
is profound, because it just

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:18.880 align:middle line:90%
kind of all makes sense.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:22.335 align:middle line:84%
But when he started reading
about mitochondrial DNA and--

00:44:22.335 --> 00:44:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That you were
writing about at, like, 13.

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Yeah.

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And the first time I wrote
about mitochondrial DNA,

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:28.600 align:middle line:90%
I think I was seven.

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:28.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:30.097 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's true.

00:44:30.097 --> 00:44:31.040 align:middle line:90%
That's in here.

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: And he started also
reading about different ways

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:38.060 align:middle line:84%
that we can combat
cancers and we

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:41.030 align:middle line:84%
can combat different things
like dementias and things

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:44.600 align:middle line:84%
like that, like Alzheimer's
by being able to turn

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.670 align:middle line:90%
on and off different proteins.

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:48.840 align:middle line:90%
And he was just astounded.

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:49.640 align:middle line:90%
He said--

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Here it is.

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:50.880 align:middle line:90%
We're here now.

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: Amazing.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, and so, why not?

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.350 align:middle line:90%
Let science flourish.

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:55.550 align:middle line:90%
Let us be comfortable.

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Let us live every
moment of life.

00:44:57.290 --> 00:45:01.070 align:middle line:84%
But don't think that we are
going to circumvent our soul's

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:02.990 align:middle line:84%
own plan for
ourselves, and I think

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:04.602 align:middle line:90%
that's an important message.

00:45:04.602 --> 00:45:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we can be more
comfortable, but may it all

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.790 align:middle line:90%
be like your dad.

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Have a nice, long swim
in his Jack LaLanne body,

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:12.900 align:middle line:90%
and boom, lie down and die.

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:13.710 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:14.510 align:middle line:90%
That's perfect.

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:16.370 align:middle line:90%
And what a wild story that is.

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:18.740 align:middle line:84%
I just so appreciate you
sharing that with us.

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:20.948 align:middle line:84%
We didn't get to some of
the other really interesting

00:45:20.948 --> 00:45:21.748 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:45:21.748 --> 00:45:23.330 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more
in the DNA story.

00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:25.130 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot that
you understand

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:28.550 align:middle line:84%
about parallel realities
and such and our living

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:31.820 align:middle line:84%
in parallel realities,
streams of the same thing

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:33.240 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.650 align:middle line:84%
So much more that we'll
have you back repeatedly

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:38.240 align:middle line:90%
to continue the story with you.

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.550 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted
everyone to have a chance

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:41.690 align:middle line:90%
to get to know you.

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: Oh, [LAUGHS]
thank you very much.

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:45.350 align:middle line:90%
It's been so nice being here.

00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And if I could just tell
people watching this--

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:49.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: --I would love
to be able to tell people

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:54.500 align:middle line:84%
that you are enough
just as you are,

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.030 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing
you need to change.

00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:00.050 align:middle line:84%
You're absolutely
stunning and beautiful.

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
not a bumper sticker.

00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:02.565 align:middle line:90%
You mean it.

00:46:02.565 --> 00:46:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: I really do.

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.273 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Looking at
it from all dimensions,

00:46:05.273 --> 00:46:08.960 align:middle line:84%
of all the iterations of you
that exist now, we're enough.

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.533 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: We are enough.

00:46:10.533 --> 00:46:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
for that, and that's

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.550 align:middle line:90%
very encouraging to people.

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And you're just a light
and an inspiration,

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:20.030 align:middle line:84%
but also a vast wealth of
information we haven't even

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:22.040 align:middle line:90%
begun to tap yet, so thank you.

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have another
book coming out too.

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: I do.

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MUTER: The book that will
be coming out very soon

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:33.740 align:middle line:84%
actually is called "Inside:
Past Life Connections."

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:36.530 align:middle line:84%
And it actually talks
about how past lives work

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:40.040 align:middle line:84%
and how we can actually
access and tap into them.

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And how past life therapies
are actually helping us today,

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:46.100 align:middle line:84%
but not necessarily
the way you think

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:47.990 align:middle line:90%
that they are helping us today.

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:51.080 align:middle line:10%
And then soon after that,
so a few weeks later,

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.850 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to have
a book on what is

00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:54.980 align:middle line:10%
parallel existences
and parallel lives,

00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:58.580 align:middle line:10%
and how all of these
ideas actually work off

00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:01.190 align:middle line:10%
of the same premises,
which is there

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:04.100 align:middle line:10%
is nobody connected to the
other side of the veil closer

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:05.000 align:middle line:10%
than you.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.870 align:middle line:10%
That means no one knows the
other side of the veil closer

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:11.450 align:middle line:10%
than you, and you have
direct access to it.

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:15.657 align:middle line:84%
And we can find ways
to open that up.

00:47:15.657 --> 00:47:16.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:17.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking forward to it.

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:19.752 align:middle line:84%
I've already read part of
one, and you're a very clear,

00:47:19.752 --> 00:47:21.110 align:middle line:90%
pristine writer, so thank you.

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I'm an
admirer of your work.

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:25.122 align:middle line:90%
>>MUTER: [LAUGHS] Thank you.

00:47:25.122 --> 00:47:26.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank
you so much, Maren.

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.220 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.800 align:middle line:84%
You can pick up Maren's
"Book of Buried Letters"

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.980 align:middle line:84%
at Amazon and other booksellers,
along with the new work

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:34.857 align:middle line:90%
we just discussed.

00:47:34.857 --> 00:47:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I think we'll be
seeing a lot of Maren

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:40.130 align:middle line:84%
in the future as a shining
light in a very confused world.

00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:42.080 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:43.580 align:middle line:10%
on "Open Minds."

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:47.830 align:middle line:90%
