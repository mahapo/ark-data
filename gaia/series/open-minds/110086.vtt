00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:30.350 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Many of the
kids being born into and raised

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.250 align:middle line:10%
in the world today have come
in with little in common,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.900 align:middle line:10%
energetically, from
previous generations.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Though there have always been
sensitives among us and seers,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.640 align:middle line:84%
the doors have been
blown wide open

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.760 align:middle line:84%
by these children
of the evolution,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.620 align:middle line:84%
as they're called by
author Meg Blackburn Losey.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Meg is with us today
to tell us that it's

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.730 align:middle line:84%
us, not these children,
who aren't keeping up.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.210 align:middle line:90%
But we can change that.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.079 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MEG BLACKBURN LOSEY:
I'm so thrilled to be here

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.045 align:middle line:84%
and can't wait to talk
with you about this.

00:00:57.045 --> 00:00:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I'm so
happy to have you here, too.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Because I just
love this subject.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.404 align:middle line:84%
I look at this-- what
an array of experiences.

00:01:06.404 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:84%
The only thing
they have in common

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.000 align:middle line:84%
is that they have nothing
in common from each other

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.650 align:middle line:84%
and also from what's
happened before,

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.340 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the most
beautiful light of the light

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.080 align:middle line:90%
or darkest of the dark.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.490 align:middle line:84%
It's all happening with
the little kids now.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.890 align:middle line:10%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Yeah,
it's quite a wide array.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.790 align:middle line:10%
And when I first started doing
this-- experiencing it I guess

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.250 align:middle line:10%
is a better word--
with the kids,

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.920 align:middle line:10%
I thought that I had discovered
a kind of a niche of children

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.190 align:middle line:10%
that were very cool,
very special, very gifted

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.260 align:middle line:10%
and that that was
all there was to it.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.380 align:middle line:90%
And that was a big deal.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And then, as I started
traveling around the world

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.710 align:middle line:84%
and talking about it and talking
to parents and caregivers

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.830 align:middle line:84%
and educators and
physicians and-- I

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:84%
get around a lot--
what I realized was

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.150 align:middle line:84%
this is a lot bigger
picture than I

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.720 align:middle line:84%
had a clue about back
then, that any of us did.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.062 align:middle line:90%
And you were one yourself.

00:02:05.062 --> 00:02:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Yes.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.061 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so let's
start with your own story,

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:10.187 align:middle line:90%
growing up.

00:02:10.187 --> 00:02:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
I didn't understand

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.360 align:middle line:84%
that being the way
I am wasn't normal.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.110 align:middle line:84%
And I always was
very frustrated.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.600 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm extremely intuitive.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And as I got older, more and
more of my abilities opened up.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.420 align:middle line:90%
And I can literally see energy.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.120 align:middle line:84%
I can literally
see inside a body.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.920 align:middle line:84%
I can watch a calorie
fire or look at DNA.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.990 align:middle line:84%
It's incredible
once you realize.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And just
before the camera came on

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.560 align:middle line:84%
you're saying wow,
you've got some chaos

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.518 align:middle line:90%
going on in your field.

00:02:39.518 --> 00:02:40.722 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yep.

00:02:40.722 --> 00:02:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
Yeah, I can't help it.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But you can't help it.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.800 align:middle line:90%
You see everything.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: But I
try not to be intrusive.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.450 align:middle line:84%
I actually apply
manners to that.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't think
just because you

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.264 align:middle line:84%
can do it that it should
thrown at everybody.

00:02:53.264 --> 00:02:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You should be
sharing, yes, exactly.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: I only
usually comment when asked.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.380 align:middle line:90%
But anyway--

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you were also
very inventive as a little kid.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Yeah,
I found ways to just deal

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.420 align:middle line:90%
with who I was.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Because I had a very
deep Catholic upbringing.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.480 align:middle line:90%
Of course, I am recovered now.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.745 align:middle line:84%
So there were so many of
those things in the background

00:03:14.745 --> 00:03:19.040 align:middle line:84%
that, being who I was, I
likened it to the saints

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.460 align:middle line:90%
they were teaching us about.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.160 align:middle line:90%
Because the saints heard voices.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.320 align:middle line:90%
And I have my whole life.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.800 align:middle line:84%
I've had visions
of my whole life.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.490 align:middle line:90%
I've had knowings my whole life.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.050 align:middle line:90%
But people didn't believe me.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.860 align:middle line:84%
So I can really relate to what's
happening with these kids.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And as I've grown
and realized there's

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.620 align:middle line:84%
really nothing to
defend, what I've learned

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.900 align:middle line:84%
is the more we
relax, the more we

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.130 align:middle line:84%
are available to our
own greater nature.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.756 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:45.756 --> 00:03:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
And so I tell people

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.830 align:middle line:84%
it's about learning about
ourselves intimately

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.780 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time,
releasing our defenses.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you have
problems, as a kid

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.560 align:middle line:84%
in particular, because
you were different?

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Because you're dealing with
these kids now, of course,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:84%
that's what you do
all day every day.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Did you have
problems as a child?

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: I did.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.290 align:middle line:84%
I knew when people
weren't telling the truth.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.220 align:middle line:84%
I knew when
something was not OK.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that a lot of what I
was being made to do wasn't OK.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And I used to stand up,
even in religion class,

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.690 align:middle line:84%
and say how can
you tell me this?

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:84%
How can this have
happened and you

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.940 align:middle line:84%
be so sure-- I can't
remember an example,

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.580 align:middle line:90%
because it happened a lot.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And the nuns would say oh,
well, it's in the Bible.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.264 align:middle line:90%
It has to be true.

00:04:38.264 --> 00:04:39.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: And I'm
sitting there thinking--

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.440 align:middle line:90%
and don't get me wrong.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm not anti-religion.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.770 align:middle line:84%
But my experience
was that I was being

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.070 align:middle line:84%
told things that were
very narrow in scope, when

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.060 align:middle line:90%
I knew so much more.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't understand
why what I knew wasn't OK.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
seeing with the kids,

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.500 align:middle line:84%
is we as a society-- some
of us, like you and me,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and others that are out
here doing the work,

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.100 align:middle line:84%
as I call it-- we
really get that there's

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.585 align:middle line:90%
something going on.

00:05:10.585 --> 00:05:13.620 align:middle line:84%
We're the bridge generation,
as I like to say.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.540 align:middle line:84%
We're the ones that had
abilities like I did as a kid.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.210 align:middle line:90%
And I shut up for a while.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.980 align:middle line:90%
Because people laughed at me.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.270 align:middle line:84%
I'd want to know how
to make something.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.109 align:middle line:84%
Like one year it was stuffing
for Thanksgiving dinner.

00:05:26.109 --> 00:05:27.400 align:middle line:90%
Well I don't care for stuffing.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.810 align:middle line:90%
So I don't make it.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.740 align:middle line:90%
But I had 40 people coming.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's a staple.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm walking
in the grocery store.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I need
to make stuffing.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.129 align:middle line:84%
And I started hearing
the ingredients--

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How to make it.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
--how to make it.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.452 align:middle line:84%
And everybody was raving
and wanted the recipe.

00:05:42.452 --> 00:05:43.660 align:middle line:90%
So I told them what happened.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:90%
And they laughed behind my back.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.380 align:middle line:90%
And it shut me up for a while.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also I
remember in your book

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.540 align:middle line:84%
you had said you invented a
little car that would come up

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.570 align:middle line:84%
to a parking spot, instead
of going through all

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.255 align:middle line:84%
those various points
on your wheel and in

00:05:55.255 --> 00:05:58.060 align:middle line:84%
and out, the wheels
turned sideways.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.451 align:middle line:84%
And it would just
slot itself in.

00:06:00.451 --> 00:06:00.950 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Yep, I did.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.550 align:middle line:90%
I did toothpaste dispensers.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.030 align:middle line:84%
I had a whole plethora of things
that I knew could be possible.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still seeing
them being invented.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.800 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of fun.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.591 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they're
all coming out now.

00:06:13.591 --> 00:06:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And so you say that
what we're witnessing

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.320 align:middle line:84%
is called fast
forward evolution now.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
We truly are, Regina.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.580 align:middle line:84%
We're having a fast forward
evolution of humanity.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.610 align:middle line:84%
This includes our bodies, our
minds, our consciousness--

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.390 align:middle line:84%
minds and consciousness
are not the same-- even how

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:35.280 align:middle line:84%
we internalize and apply
things in our lives.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And there are several things
that are causing that.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.604 align:middle line:84%
First of all, because
of all the technologies,

00:06:41.604 --> 00:06:44.020 align:middle line:84%
we're more highly intelligent
and informed than we've ever

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.890 align:middle line:90%
been.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Energetically, there
have been events

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.440 align:middle line:84%
happening that have changed
the tone of our harmonics.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.730 align:middle line:84%
We're created of
nothing but energy,

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.930 align:middle line:84%
all harmonically
assembled to reflect

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.340 align:middle line:90%
the beauty of each of us.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let me
insert a question in here.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.247 align:middle line:84%
I assume you're talking
about cosmic events that

00:07:03.247 --> 00:07:03.830 align:middle line:90%
have occurred.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
Cosmic events,

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.440 align:middle line:90%
multidimensional events.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA:
Multidimensional events.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.023 align:middle line:84%
And have you noticed that
those cosmic events are having

00:07:09.023 --> 00:07:13.930 align:middle line:84%
a direct translation into what's
being displayed from newborns

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:14.780 align:middle line:90%
and young children?

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Yes.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In relation to it?

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Absolutely.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.810 align:middle line:84%
It's part of what's
making it possible.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.570 align:middle line:84%
In 2012, when the planetary
alignment happened,

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.840 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of change prior
to that-- started about 2009.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And in 2012, as that alignment
occurred, in my vision,

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.610 align:middle line:84%
the Earth actually paused,
rocked back a slight bit,

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.587 align:middle line:90%
and then started a new rotation.

00:07:41.587 --> 00:07:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Almost like
a retrograde of sorts.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Yeah, almost,
but not really a true one.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.780 align:middle line:90%
It was like a rock back.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And then it started
its next 26,000

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.190 align:middle line:90%
plus thousand year thing.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:57.980 align:middle line:84%
In that moment it was
like an energetic reboot,

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.610 align:middle line:84%
where the way that
we receive energy,

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.780 align:middle line:84%
the way that our bodies
are working with energy

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.750 align:middle line:90%
and information, are different.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, instead of
learning linearly

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.070 align:middle line:84%
with our brains,
which are electrical,

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.210 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is
electromagnetic.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:16.540 align:middle line:90%
It's in every cell of our body.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.430 align:middle line:90%
It surrounds us.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And we have this
beautiful etheric anatomy.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.910 align:middle line:84%
We're able to absorb
information and not

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.150 align:middle line:90%
even know we know it yet.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.550 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times people say I
was just talking to this person

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.440 align:middle line:84%
and all these things
came out of my mouth.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And I have no idea
where that came from.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.179 align:middle line:90%
We have absorbed things.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And we know them
on a different kind

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:42.360 align:middle line:84%
of knowing than on a
logical, line thinking.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.416 align:middle line:84%
So us doing that, us
exploring ourselves,

00:08:45.416 --> 00:08:46.790 align:middle line:84%
us saying you know
what, it's OK.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:47.940 align:middle line:90%
We're just wonderful.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.480 align:middle line:90%
And that's just fine.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Or gosh, there are
possibilities available that we

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.470 align:middle line:90%
didn't know about.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:00.320 align:middle line:84%
So us doing that put that
into the common consciousness.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.390 align:middle line:90%
It is a reality.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.760 align:middle line:90%
Common consciousness exists.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And because we did that,
our next generation

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.410 align:middle line:84%
is being born with
abilities that many of us

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.600 align:middle line:84%
had to work to open
or hid for a long time

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.820 align:middle line:84%
because people weren't
caught up with us yet.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.900 align:middle line:90%
We were the forerunners.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And so now what
we're seeing-- it

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:20.819 align:middle line:90%
started with the Indigo Kids.

00:09:20.819 --> 00:09:21.860 align:middle line:90%
And I'll go through them.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.651 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, we're
going to go through all

00:09:23.651 --> 00:09:26.550 align:middle line:84%
of the different
iterations, generations,

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.280 align:middle line:84%
within just a short
few year span even.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.650 align:middle line:84%
These are different generations
in terms of their skills

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and talents and what they're
displaying in their auras.

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And I want you, in a bit,
to go through all of it.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: OK.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I also
want to got to the point

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.870 align:middle line:84%
where, I think around
2000, where you start

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.440 align:middle line:90%
hearing them talking to you.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Oh gosh.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was weird.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting at my computer in
Tennessee, when we lived there.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And one of the conferences
I did every year

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.427 align:middle line:84%
e-mailed me and says
OK Dr. Meg, what

00:09:52.427 --> 00:09:54.010 align:middle line:84%
are you going to
talk about this year?

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.093 align:middle line:84%
And I thought gee, I really
ought to switch it up.

00:09:56.093 --> 00:09:57.910 align:middle line:84%
I've been there a
number of years.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.510 align:middle line:90%
And what can I do?

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:03.260 align:middle line:90%
And I heard-- I have these guys.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:09.920 align:middle line:84%
I heard speak of the children,
very sincerely serious.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.950 align:middle line:90%
And I started laughing.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.029 align:middle line:84%
I'm very spiritually
smart aleck.

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:14.070 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like yeah, right.

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.680 align:middle line:84%
I have no knowledge,
no expertise.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Well why would I put
myself out there and ask

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.840 align:middle line:90%
to be paid to talk about it?

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.745 align:middle line:90%
Speak of the children, I heard.

00:10:25.745 --> 00:10:28.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, seriously?

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.380 align:middle line:90%
Speak of the children.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Three times is
always truth for me.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:31.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:32.140 align:middle line:90%
Me too.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.897 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
So I typed back.

00:10:33.897 --> 00:10:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Meg will talk about the
children of now, blah, blah,

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.112 align:middle line:90%
blahs, two or three sentences.

00:10:38.112 --> 00:10:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And I thought oh my god,
what am I going to do?

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.054 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What am I
going to talk about?

00:10:42.054 --> 00:10:44.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: So I
showed up at the conference.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And this woman
came by and showed

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.950 align:middle line:84%
me all of these
photographs of kids

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:52.540 align:middle line:84%
with amazing orbs and
colorful geometries.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:53.970 align:middle line:90%
And they were multiple pictures.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And they did experiments and
took pictures with cameras,

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.140 align:middle line:84%
all different, to see if
they would still show up.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized
was that the children

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.970 align:middle line:84%
were able to identify
themselves energetically

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.000 align:middle line:84%
by reflecting these
things in the photographs.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.380 align:middle line:84%
That was very
interesting for me.

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.600 align:middle line:90%
It was just a kind of an aside.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And the next
morning was my talk.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And I was ironing a
jacket in a hurry,

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.020 align:middle line:90%
like we do when we travel.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.450 align:middle line:90%
And I was listing to one side.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:22.750 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't stand up straight.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.660 align:middle line:84%
My husband was with
me, which was unusual.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.290 align:middle line:90%
And I said, honey.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.240 align:middle line:90%
My ears feel OK.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.698 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I'm
sick or anything.

00:11:29.698 --> 00:11:31.610 align:middle line:90%
But I can't stand up straight.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And he just twinkled because he
knew something was coming up.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:38.010 align:middle line:90%
And I just took a minute.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:38.750 align:middle line:90%
And I looked.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And right about here in my
field was this beautiful, teal

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.000 align:middle line:90%
colored orb.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was stuck to me, like
rubber cement or something,

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.390 align:middle line:84%
like it had just
stuck to my field.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.930 align:middle line:84%
By the end of the day
there were four of them.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.320 align:middle line:90%
And I was barely standing up.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.370 align:middle line:90%
Because I am that sensitive.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:06.210 align:middle line:84%
But I had to leave the
conference and get on a plane

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:06.890 align:middle line:90%
to Sedona.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.000 align:middle line:90%
I had a seven week run.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.639 align:middle line:90%
I was going a lot of places.

00:12:09.639 --> 00:12:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And every weekend I
was speaking somewhere.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.850 align:middle line:90%
And so I get to the airport.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:20.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm surrounded by children,
literally little Earth people.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And then on the planes,
again, not an adult near me,

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:28.560 align:middle line:84%
I had children telling me
all this stuff on the trips.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.370 align:middle line:90%
So I get to Sedona.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking to
a friend of mine.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.453 align:middle line:84%
We were writing a
screenplay together.

00:12:32.453 --> 00:12:35.290 align:middle line:90%
And he says how'd it go?

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Because he knew I was freaked
that I was even doing it.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.730 align:middle line:90%
And I said it was unbelievable.

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:41.670 align:middle line:84%
My two hour talk
ended up going out

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:44.680 align:middle line:84%
in the hall for another hour
when they needed the room.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.300 align:middle line:84%
There was so much
interest and so much need.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.414 align:middle line:90%
I got a wake up call.

00:12:48.414 --> 00:12:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't realize
how much I actually

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.099 align:middle line:90%
knew, which was considerable.

00:12:53.099 --> 00:12:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
because you were one.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.015 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
Yeah, exactly.

00:12:56.015 --> 00:13:00.140 align:middle line:84%
So he says, well why don't we
put your kids-- he called it--

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.580 align:middle line:90%
in our screenplay.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And I heard giggling in my
head, several different voices.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like oh my god,
now I'm hearing them.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.740 align:middle line:90%
And they said OK, great.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Well it got to the point where
they were doing this so much--

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.020 align:middle line:84%
there was one in
particular, Weston.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.330 align:middle line:84%
I called him William
in the first book.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And Weston was a
massively-- is still--

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:26.110 align:middle line:90%
a massively gifted telepath.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And he would
actually-- and they all

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:33.230 align:middle line:84%
did-- Weston would literally
take over my reality.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.750 align:middle line:84%
I could be sitting
there, writing

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:39.010 align:middle line:84%
or doing whatever Meg does,
and all of the sudden I'd

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.560 align:middle line:90%
see a whole new reality.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.830 align:middle line:84%
I'd see Weston and a whole
bunch of these galactic looking

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:47.374 align:middle line:84%
people that look like that
bar scene in the Star Wars--

00:13:47.374 --> 00:13:47.915 align:middle line:90%
very similar.

00:13:47.915 --> 00:13:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Crazy.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, crazy.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.046 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
Crazy looking beings.

00:13:51.046 --> 00:13:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a recording
studio in New York City.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was making
a CD for the kids,

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.130 align:middle line:84%
just to help them
understand a lot of stuff.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And all of the
sudden I was talking

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.990 align:middle line:84%
about-- I was using the
idea of boxes like presents.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:06.540 align:middle line:90%
And they had all these things.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And I took them
through and talked

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:12.180 align:middle line:84%
to them about different feelings
and how to bring them out

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.670 align:middle line:84%
and how to fill themself
with other good things.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:15.870 align:middle line:90%
And it was like that.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And I got to in the
imagination box.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.852 align:middle line:84%
And I was totally winging this
whole recording, as it was.

00:14:21.852 --> 00:14:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Because that's how
I do everything.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And all of the sudden-- and
I said the imagination box

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:29.780 align:middle line:90%
can never be full.

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Because our imagination
is infinite.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And with that, my
entire reality changed.

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm in another world.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking
down at this box.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's bullfrogs hopping
out of it and croaking,

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:47.160 align:middle line:84%
and just massively pouring
out of this box and croak--

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.770 align:middle line:90%
I started laughing.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.077 align:middle line:90%
And I knew what was going on.

00:14:50.077 --> 00:14:50.660 align:middle line:90%
It was Weston.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.993 align:middle line:90%
Because he did things like that.

00:14:51.993 --> 00:14:53.710 align:middle line:90%
He had a great sense of humor.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And I actually left me
giggling in the recording.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.180 align:middle line:90%
It's hilarious.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.800 align:middle line:90%
But that's what was going on.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:04.820 align:middle line:84%
And the other kids,
Lauren, she was not

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.910 align:middle line:84%
functional in her
human body at all.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:07.666 align:middle line:90%
She was beautiful.

00:15:07.666 --> 00:15:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember
you writing about her.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.373 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: And
she would wake me up.

00:15:10.373 --> 00:15:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we lost her
a few years ago.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:16.700 align:middle line:84%
I happened to be there
through her-- most of that.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And it was beautiful for
her to be free again.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.330 align:middle line:90%
But Lauren would wake me up.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And she would be ballet
dancing in a room

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:26.750 align:middle line:90%
of mirrors and giggling.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:30.070 align:middle line:90%
And she'd say see, I'm free.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Nobody needs to
feel sorry for me.

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:33.810 align:middle line:90%
I can dance.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In real life she had
very little use of her body.

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: None.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, she was very affected.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.100 align:middle line:84%
She was one of the
vaccine kids, born normal

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.130 align:middle line:90%
and hit the dirt later.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And so anyway, they
started talking in my head.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:49.740 align:middle line:84%
They started saying
these profound things.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.330 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like I'm really careful.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.360 align:middle line:90%
My world is so strange anyway.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.410 align:middle line:90%
And I write a lot.

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:57.890 align:middle line:90%
And I put books out for people.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very careful to validate
or be very clear about what I'm

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.657 align:middle line:90%
saying and know it to be true.

00:16:05.657 --> 00:16:06.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.573 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: And so I
said to these little voices,

00:16:08.573 --> 00:16:11.070 align:middle line:84%
these four little voices,
if you guys are real,

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:11.850 align:middle line:90%
start showing up.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:13.930 align:middle line:84%
Because I think
I'm losing my mind.

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:16.030 align:middle line:90%
They were in my head 24/7.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was hard to
have my own thoughts.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.310 align:middle line:90%
They wanted my attention.

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.950 align:middle line:90%
I figured that out.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And over the next months,
sure enough, they all

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:28.380 align:middle line:84%
did show up, in their own
way, in different places

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:29.230 align:middle line:90%
that I traveled.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.140 align:middle line:90%
And I met them all.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And each of those first four
were physically affected

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.980 align:middle line:90%
and not able to speak.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.590 align:middle line:90%
But Weston's mom had called me.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And she said-- she
started laughing.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And she said this isn't
for me, this appointment.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:46.530 align:middle line:90%
This is for my son.

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:50.010 align:middle line:84%
He told me that he
needed to talk to you.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:51.190 align:middle line:90%
I started laughing.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:54.730 align:middle line:84%
I said I think he
already has been.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And then she--
she's amazing mom.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:58.760 align:middle line:90%
She can't hear him.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.940 align:middle line:84%
But other people had, and so she
was familiar with the concept.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.609 align:middle line:90%


00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:06.170 align:middle line:90%
And I was at a conference there.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:08.339 align:middle line:90%
And I had my back to the aisle.

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:09.839 align:middle line:84%
People were coming
out of something.

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking
to a friend of mine.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.650 align:middle line:90%
And I heard hi, I made it.

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:16.319 align:middle line:90%
And I just froze.

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:19.006 align:middle line:84%
I thought oh my
god, it's happening.

00:17:19.006 --> 00:17:19.839 align:middle line:90%
And I turned around.

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was Lauren
and her mom, who

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:25.310 align:middle line:84%
has become one of my best
friends still, Karen.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:28.834 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't get any sleep for
nights after Lauren and I--

00:17:28.834 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So they showed up.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
Yeah, they did.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they proved
that they were real.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: They did.

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:35.105 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's talk a
little bit about the hallmarks

00:17:35.105 --> 00:17:37.550 align:middle line:84%
of when a parent is
in the presence of one

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.970 align:middle line:84%
of these children, some
of the common themes

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:90%
that seem to happen.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.940 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is most parents,
most caregivers of every kind,

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.780 align:middle line:84%
are not familiar
with this phenomenon.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: So
you get a little tiny kid

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:57.640 align:middle line:84%
that starts talking about their
past life, or talking to God,

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.390 align:middle line:90%
or picking their parents.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.030 align:middle line:90%
That's a big one.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Some of them will even
name themselves in utero,

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:05.826 align:middle line:90%
or before they're conceived.

00:18:05.826 --> 00:18:08.390 align:middle line:84%
The parents will
hear their names.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.170 align:middle line:90%
And it's really fun.

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:11.760 align:middle line:84%
I heard a name for
somebody that's

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.840 align:middle line:90%
been trying to get pregnant.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:14.940 align:middle line:90%
And I wrote it down.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.570 align:middle line:90%
I didn't tell her.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:17.860 align:middle line:90%
Because she's been frustrated.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.230 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, I put it in my pocket.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:23.420 align:middle line:84%
I said when the time is
ready you'll know to tell me.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And I will give
you what I wrote.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.020 align:middle line:90%
Because she gave her name to me.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.090 align:middle line:90%
So they do this.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's just priceless
and wonderful.

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of parents that
hear those names do use them.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.459 align:middle line:84%
But for the average
parent-- first of all,

00:18:39.459 --> 00:18:41.250 align:middle line:84%
I want to make something
really clear here.

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:42.980 align:middle line:90%
This is not about religion.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not about any
set of belief systems.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.090 align:middle line:90%
It's not even spirituality.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.060 align:middle line:90%
It is human nature.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.900 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
be really clear

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.700 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not trying
to guide anybody

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.870 align:middle line:84%
on some specific
path of beliefs.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Because this is part of
who we have always been

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:00.970 align:middle line:90%
and had evolved out of.

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:05.890 align:middle line:84%
So find that it gets categorized
a lot into some woo woo thing.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.340 align:middle line:90%
And it's a reality.

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I just try to
make that really clear

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.420 align:middle line:90%
when we talk about it.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.544 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and as you
start talking about some

00:19:13.544 --> 00:19:15.216 align:middle line:84%
of the behaviors
and traits, people

00:19:15.216 --> 00:19:17.937 align:middle line:84%
will start recognizing it
within either their friends

00:19:17.937 --> 00:19:18.770 align:middle line:90%
or their own family.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: I hope so.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And say oh gosh, yeah.

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:20.370 align:middle line:90%
I've seen that.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: I hope so.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
So what happens

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:24.820 align:middle line:84%
is all of these little children
are doing all of these things.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Or somebody will feel
bad and they'll go over

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.275 align:middle line:84%
and they'll touch
them so sweetly.

00:19:29.275 --> 00:19:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And all of the sudden,
the pain's gone.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:31.950 align:middle line:90%
Or they feel better.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:36.054 align:middle line:90%


00:19:36.054 --> 00:19:40.370 align:middle line:84%
There's a plethora of
abilities they have.

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.130 align:middle line:90%
They're not all the same.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:43.180 align:middle line:90%
Some have similar.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.150 align:middle line:90%
Some are different.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.670 align:middle line:84%
In my first book,
"The Children of Now,"

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:51.260 align:middle line:84%
I listed the traits
for the two main kids.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And in the second one
I did go over each one,

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.390 align:middle line:90%
in "The Children Now Evolution."

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to go over them.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.520 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like even
throughout those one

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.082 align:middle line:84%
commonality was that
they are so sensitive--

00:20:03.082 --> 00:20:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Oh my god.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --to
everything around them.

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:08.686 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: They're
sentient is what I say.

00:20:08.686 --> 00:20:10.060 align:middle line:84%
First of all, to
finish answering

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.380 align:middle line:84%
that question-- I'll
do it very quickly-- it

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.640 align:middle line:90%
scares the parents.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.120 align:middle line:90%
It scares the relatives.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.880 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
religious teachings

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.320 align:middle line:84%
that say these kind of
things are not a good thing.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.581 align:middle line:90%
And so parents get scared.

00:20:22.581 --> 00:20:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Because they think
there's something

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.680 align:middle line:90%
wrong with their child.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And I like to make
it perfectly clear

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:32.540 align:middle line:84%
that your child is perfect, just
differently abled, not broken.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Because it's really important
for them to understand that

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.940 align:middle line:84%
just because the
child expresses more

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.591 align:middle line:84%
fully than other
children doesn't mean

00:20:40.591 --> 00:20:41.590 align:middle line:90%
there's something wrong.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:43.589 align:middle line:84%
It means there's something
very right happening.

00:20:43.589 --> 00:20:46.200 align:middle line:90%


00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.030 align:middle line:84%
To answer your question,
these children are sentient.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:52.270 align:middle line:84%
They don't just use
their five senses--

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:84%
their hearing, and their
smell, and that kind of thing.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.040 align:middle line:84%
They're using
their entire being.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And they're absorbing
information, like osmosis.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a good word
for it besides that.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is they get
out and around other people

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.000 align:middle line:90%
and in environments.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.790 align:middle line:90%
And they feel everything.

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:18.900 align:middle line:84%
They do not understand
that it's not all theirs.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:23.500 align:middle line:84%
This is what I ran into as I
got to know them long term.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.460 align:middle line:90%
Because they're empathic.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.790 align:middle line:84%
They feel other
people's feelings.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.170 align:middle line:90%
They absorb them.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.740 align:middle line:84%
They know what's going on
in every person in the room,

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.070 align:middle line:90%
especially like a classroom.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And I did a neat
chapter in the book,

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:38.970 align:middle line:90%
like a typical day in the--

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I read that,
and how they're so

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:47.310 align:middle line:84%
looked over and treated so
inappropriately for what

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:48.400 align:middle line:90%
they're experiencing.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.233 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Well
here's what happens.

00:21:50.233 --> 00:21:52.650 align:middle line:84%
When someone is sentient--
and I'm very much that way,

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.410 align:middle line:90%
so I can relate.

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:59.800 align:middle line:84%
When someone is sentient,
they get overloaded visually,

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.440 align:middle line:90%
aurally, and energetically.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So clutter, too much noise,
too many people-- if you ever

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:08.700 align:middle line:84%
watched me in a
party, or something

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.827 align:middle line:84%
like that, or a group,
I'm constantly moving.

00:22:11.827 --> 00:22:12.910 align:middle line:90%
There's a reason for that.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:14.910 align:middle line:90%
And the kids do it.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
is, is it's overload.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.450 align:middle line:84%
It's too much
energy building up.

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And if they stay in
one place, they're

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:24.990 align:middle line:84%
getting a constant feed
of that same energy.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:28.560 align:middle line:84%
So all they have to do is move
some and it shakes it off.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.400 align:middle line:84%
But we're calling that ADD,
Attention Deficit Disorder

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and Attention Deficit
and Hyperactive Disorder.

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
thing that happens

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:38.510 align:middle line:84%
is the children
are being drugged

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:41.690 align:middle line:84%
when they're only doing what
they need to do to feel good.

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and in your
book you talked about that.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:45.800 align:middle line:84%
You were talking about
one little boy wandering

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.750 align:middle line:90%
around the classroom.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And everyone else is being made
to sit still at their desks.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:51.440 align:middle line:90%
He's young.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And he's wandering
around touching things

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:54.850 align:middle line:90%
while lessons are going on.

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And you said if the teacher
or the parents or anyone

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:00.630 align:middle line:84%
would simply just
pause long enough

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:03.494 align:middle line:84%
to say well, what did you
learn at school today,

00:23:03.494 --> 00:23:04.910 align:middle line:84%
he'd be able to
recite everything.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Everything.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How everyone
felt, what the lessons

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.630 align:middle line:84%
were, and all that, where it
looks like he's dialed out,

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:11.930 align:middle line:84%
and people are passing
that judgment on him,

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:13.366 align:middle line:90%
and as you say, drugging them.

00:23:13.366 --> 00:23:14.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Exactly.

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is, they're
picking up everything.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:17.970 align:middle line:90%
They're unbelievable.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.120 align:middle line:84%
My own granddaughter
is one of these kids.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.450 align:middle line:90%
And she's phenomenal.

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:24.860 align:middle line:84%
She's 15 now and two
years ahead in school,

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.990 align:middle line:84%
and still just as aware,
but in different ways.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:29.950 align:middle line:84%
She's maturing into
different ways.

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:32.130 align:middle line:84%
The Crystalline Kids
are a real force.

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk more about
that in a few minutes.

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:34.081 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're going to, yeah.

00:23:34.081 --> 00:23:35.847 align:middle line:90%


00:23:35.847 --> 00:23:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: They
get to a certain age

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.850 align:middle line:90%
and they start acting socially.

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Because they're seeing
things that need dealt with.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's so fun.

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Because they had-- her
and a couple of kids

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:54.370 align:middle line:84%
got in trouble for
moving around a lot.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And I guess her
mom was somewhere.

00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.250 align:middle line:90%
And the school didn't reach her.

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.291 align:middle line:84%
But they reached the dad
of one of the other ones

00:24:01.291 --> 00:24:03.150 align:middle line:90%
to complain about the kids.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And the father of this
other girl knew Hailey.

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:11.660 align:middle line:90%
And he says what's going on?

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.080 align:middle line:90%
She says here's what's going on.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.940 align:middle line:84%
You need to tell miss
so and so that she needs

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.200 align:middle line:90%
to get control of her class.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Because she doesn't have it.

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.030 align:middle line:90%
And we don't have what we need.

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was like
that's how they are.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And they're very aware
of what's going on.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.490 align:middle line:90%
But nobody asked them.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.940 align:middle line:84%
The school curriculums
that we are still

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.507 align:middle line:84%
using are literally
over 100 years old.

00:24:33.507 --> 00:24:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.355 align:middle line:84%
It's so outdated,
so inappropriate.

00:24:36.355 --> 00:24:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: So
the world 100 years ago

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:41.120 align:middle line:90%
was very Puritanistic.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:45.060 align:middle line:90%
It was very primitive.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:49.570 align:middle line:84%
They may have had mail
delivery by a pony.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you heard something,
it was years later,

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:53.680 align:middle line:90%
if you heard it at all.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And the world now
is so different.

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.560 align:middle line:90%
And we are different.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.290 align:middle line:90%
We have evolved.

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And with the opening
of our conscious nature

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.050 align:middle line:90%
comes higher intelligence.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:07.040 align:middle line:90%
They work hand in hand.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And as consciousness
expands, which it is doing,

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.400 align:middle line:90%
we call it waking up.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.210 align:middle line:84%
But in truth,
what's happening is

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.300 align:middle line:84%
we are able to reach
parts of ourselves

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.004 align:middle line:90%
we didn't even know we had.

00:25:21.004 --> 00:25:23.170 align:middle line:90%
That brings higher intelligence.

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:27.450 align:middle line:84%
But it also works in
tandem with our DNA.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:29.670 align:middle line:90%
And our DNA responds to that.

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And it shines brighter,
just to put it simply,

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:36.970 align:middle line:84%
the higher our
awareness gets, the more

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:39.910 align:middle line:84%
connected with our
consciousness our DNA becomes.

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:45.880 align:middle line:84%
So then our entire body
becomes that consciousness

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:46.524 align:middle line:90%
in all worlds.

00:25:46.524 --> 00:25:47.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well and
that's where we

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.200 align:middle line:84%
start getting into real
problems with these little kids

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:56.052 align:middle line:90%
and vaccines, toxins, gluten.

00:25:56.052 --> 00:25:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: All of it.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:58.093 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All of it.

00:25:58.093 --> 00:26:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Because these
kids, their DNA has

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.492 align:middle line:90%
been matched to consciousness.

00:26:03.492 --> 00:26:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Yes.

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Their DNA and their
consciousness-- that's what

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.990 align:middle line:90%
makes them sentient.

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Their DNA-- it's not
that we're getting

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:16.150 align:middle line:84%
some super number of
strands of DNA or something

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:17.870 align:middle line:90%
is growing that we never had.

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:19.490 align:middle line:90%
It's not that at all.

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:25.350 align:middle line:84%
It's how the DNA is acting and
expressing, epigenetically.

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And epigenetically,
part of that expression

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.870 align:middle line:90%
is our new ways of awareness.

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:34.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's really interesting.

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:36.230 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know
something's possible

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:38.912 align:middle line:90%
until we know it's possible.

00:26:38.912 --> 00:26:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going
to wait and ask you

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.240 align:middle line:90%
later on in the conversation.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.080 align:middle line:84%
But we might as well
jump into it now.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.390 align:middle line:84%
So these kids, their DNA
is being elevated along

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:52.130 align:middle line:84%
with the consciousness, or made
more sentient, more sensitive,

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:53.680 align:middle line:90%
more expressive.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
throw thimerosal,

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:01.140 align:middle line:84%
the incredibly toxic
effects of having

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.530 align:middle line:84%
that many different
constituents thrown

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:06.900 align:middle line:84%
into the body at
such a young age,

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.530 align:middle line:84%
these little kids are
completely overloaded.

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:11.360 align:middle line:90%
The more sensitive ones are.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.050 align:middle line:90%
Because they say oh, well.

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:14.900 align:middle line:90%
Vaccines cause autism.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.257 align:middle line:90%
It's not that cut and dry.

00:27:16.257 --> 00:27:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: No, it's not.

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
an important link.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: This
is one of my soapboxes.

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:21.650 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:22.441 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Go ahead.

00:27:22.441 --> 00:27:25.740 align:middle line:10%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: OK,
so these kids are-- well,

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.030 align:middle line:10%
let's put it this way.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Each of us is unique
in all of creation.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.530 align:middle line:84%
We are put together
with a set of particles

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:35.110 align:middle line:84%
that harmonize to reflect
the individuality of us.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:36.745 align:middle line:84%
There are no two
of us in creation.

00:27:36.745 --> 00:27:39.605 align:middle line:90%


00:27:39.605 --> 00:27:42.350 align:middle line:90%
That is considered a symphony.

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Each of us is our own
beautiful symphony.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And on a good day
everything's working right.

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And because of the way
things are changing,

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.730 align:middle line:84%
the children's frequencies--
all of these particles

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:58.850 align:middle line:84%
are made up of
frequencies of energy.

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Because of that, their nature
is much finer than ours.

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:05.690 align:middle line:90%
We are still more dense.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Their frequencies are
higher, which makes them

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.990 align:middle line:90%
actually literally lighter.

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Human light field is measurable
by science, by the way.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:18.340 align:middle line:84%
This is not something
I'm making up.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:21.160 align:middle line:84%
And so you get these very
high sensitive children

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.930 align:middle line:84%
coming in that are
really high frequency.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:25.700 align:middle line:84%
They're born with all
of these abilities

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.710 align:middle line:90%
intact and the sensitivity.

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And then they're exposed
to environmental toxins.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.754 align:middle line:84%
There are a plethora of things--
chemicals, heavy metals--

00:28:37.754 --> 00:28:38.545 align:middle line:90%
in her environment.

00:28:38.545 --> 00:28:40.852 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To say nothing
of herbicides, pesticides,

00:28:40.852 --> 00:28:41.560 align:middle line:90%
and insecticides.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: All of it.

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything
in our food.

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.145 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Exactly.

00:28:44.145 --> 00:28:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: GMOs.

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:47.649 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: And so
OK, so vaccines-- supposedly

00:28:47.649 --> 00:28:48.940 align:middle line:90%
they're not doing this anymore.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:50.860 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know what
they're using for a carrier.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.286 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Instead of thimerosal.

00:28:52.286 --> 00:28:54.452 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Yeah,
they were using thimerosal.

00:28:54.452 --> 00:28:56.040 align:middle line:84%
They were using
mercury as a carrier.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Well let me talk about
mercury a minute.

00:28:57.970 --> 00:28:59.460 align:middle line:90%
Mercury was studied.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:03.470 align:middle line:84%
It has been studied as fuel
for interstellar travel because

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:05.570 align:middle line:90%
of its properties.

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Mercury can be in many
forms-- liquid, gaseous,

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.220 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.070 align:middle line:90%
It's conductive.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And so you take a very
fine frequency child

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and you put something
like that, or thimerosal,

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.520 align:middle line:90%
or some of the other ones.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.870 align:middle line:90%
They have very similar effects.

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And as that moves
through the body,

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:29.960 align:middle line:84%
it expands the energy
field of the consciousness

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.830 align:middle line:90%
away from that child's body.

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:34.200 align:middle line:90%
And it causes problems.

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.687 align:middle line:90%
And I illustrated in the book--

00:29:35.687 --> 00:29:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, in the book
you have a few plates showing

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:42.610 align:middle line:84%
an intact energy field-- or do
you also interchangeably can

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.940 align:middle line:84%
we call that the aura, do
you prefer just energy?

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: No,
it's actually not--

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:47.450 align:middle line:90%
the aura that we--

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:49.491 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're just
talking about the one right

00:29:49.491 --> 00:29:50.322 align:middle line:90%
around the body.

00:29:50.322 --> 00:29:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
Yeah, we have a bubble

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:53.270 align:middle line:90%
of energy around our bodies.

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:54.890 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
call that the aura.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:56.270 align:middle line:84%
I literally see
this whole thing.

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:58.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not the aura.

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:00.230 align:middle line:90%
I call it our external field.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:01.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a communication station.

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:05.270 align:middle line:84%
It brings information
and energy in.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And it dumbs it down
to our human world.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And it puts all of our
experience out to creation.

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.900 align:middle line:90%
And creation starts to respond.

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.100 align:middle line:90%
So it has a very big job.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:22.440 align:middle line:84%
The aura is a reflection off of
that of what's going on inside.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:26.860 align:middle line:84%
So it could be a certain
color or different colors

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:27.715 align:middle line:90%
in different places.

00:30:27.715 --> 00:30:29.510 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on
right that minute,

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:30.882 align:middle line:90%
where is that person at.

00:30:30.882 --> 00:30:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Or what's going on,
and how do they feel,

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.890 align:middle line:84%
and are they happy, or are
they learning something,

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:35.660 align:middle line:90%
are they healing?

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.950 align:middle line:84%
All of that comes into
play in those colors.

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's
go back to the energy

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:41.580 align:middle line:90%
field of these kids.

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: So what
happens is the consciousness is

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:50.500 align:middle line:84%
pushed in some cases out
away from that encapsulation,

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:54.060 align:middle line:84%
irregularly, or even
in a regular pattern,

00:30:54.060 --> 00:31:00.120 align:middle line:84%
where in some cases that
encapsulation's-- I'm just

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.720 align:middle line:84%
going to give you a visual--
maybe it stops here.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.210 align:middle line:90%
It's actually bigger than that.

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:08.350 align:middle line:84%
But the consciousness
gets pushed way up higher.

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:09.607 align:middle line:90%
So there's a gap.

00:31:09.607 --> 00:31:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, in
one of these plates.

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:14.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: That's
in the most severe cases.

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's when those children
are not even communicative.

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:22.410 align:middle line:84%
But the heavy metals
are contributing

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:25.010 align:middle line:84%
an awful lot and the
vaccines-- and that's

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:29.262 align:middle line:84%
what's been in them-- to
perfectly normal children

00:31:29.262 --> 00:31:29.970 align:middle line:90%
hitting the dirt.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And I have witnessed this I
can't tell you how many times.

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:34.990 align:middle line:90%
A child receives vaccinations.

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And all of the sudden they
spike a really high fever

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.760 align:middle line:90%
of an unknown origin.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:44.800 align:middle line:84%
They have seizures,
any degree of seizures,

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.040 align:middle line:84%
from focal seizures,
which is just

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.970 align:middle line:84%
like nobody's home for a minute,
to full out wracking the body

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:51.710 align:middle line:90%
seizures.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can figure out
where they're coming from.

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Then they start to
lack communication.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.950 align:middle line:84%
They start to
ritualize what they do.

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:05.800 align:middle line:84%
They start to have
different behaviors.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.310 align:middle line:84%
They start having
different issues

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:12.350 align:middle line:84%
in their bodies--
autoimmune, digestive.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:14.320 align:middle line:90%
And this is autism.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And the reason this is happening
is because modern medicine

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:20.630 align:middle line:84%
does not consider the
subtle energy field

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:25.040 align:middle line:84%
or even have a clue about
the etheric anatomy that

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.660 align:middle line:90%
is also part of us.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:31.260 align:middle line:84%
So that's why there's
such a spectrum of autism.

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Now you take these same
high frequency children

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and you feed them-- you think
you're doing a really good job.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And we hear a lot lately
about gluten sensitivities

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:45.340 align:middle line:90%
and different things like that.

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.870 align:middle line:84%
But what's really going
on is a lot of our foods

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:49.440 align:middle line:90%
are genetically modified.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:53.530 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea until I wrote this
book the degree that it goes on

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and some of the things
that have been done.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.884 align:middle line:90%
For just a few, for examples--

00:32:57.884 --> 00:32:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, give
a few of those.

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.561 align:middle line:84%
It was really a
nasty little table.

00:33:01.561 --> 00:33:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
Yes, it was, wasn't it?

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:04.101 align:middle line:90%
It was intentional.

00:33:04.101 --> 00:33:05.289 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:05.289 --> 00:33:07.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: When
they first started,

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.850 align:middle line:84%
they put frog
genes into tomatoes

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:11.740 align:middle line:84%
for some stupid reason
I can't even remember.

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And they put fish
DNA into strawberries

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.940 align:middle line:84%
so they'd weather
the frost better.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:24.130 align:middle line:84%
They've actually put
Roundup in plants,

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:28.600 align:middle line:84%
mostly such as soy and
different crops that

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:32.090 align:middle line:90%
are really bug magnets.

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:36.430 align:middle line:84%
So almost all soy that
you eat has Roundup

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:39.420 align:middle line:90%
as a part of its nature.

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.260 align:middle line:84%
They even, in a
couple of cases--

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:45.070 align:middle line:84%
and all these studies are
cited in the "Children Now

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Evolution"-- in some cases even
inserted human genes into food

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:52.370 align:middle line:90%
products.

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:53.760 align:middle line:90%
And we are not cannibals.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And I read recently
another recent study

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:02.730 align:middle line:84%
was showing that it appears
that it's the Roundup that's

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:05.860 align:middle line:84%
put in the late stage before
the harvest of the wheat that

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:08.699 align:middle line:84%
may be causing as much trouble
as any kind of gluten effect.

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Well I can
bring it down even further.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Gluten
has many properties.

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:17.690 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember them all,
because I'm not a scientist.

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:19.436 align:middle line:90%
I am at heart.

00:34:19.436 --> 00:34:20.230 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not.

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, and one of those
products is gliadin.

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:28.880 align:middle line:84%
When gliadin is metabolized,
those little bits

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:33.940 align:middle line:84%
that become of the original
wheat in our bodies

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:36.260 align:middle line:84%
plug into the wrong
cell receptors.

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:38.469 align:middle line:84%
They plug into our
thyroid receptors,

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:42.510 align:middle line:84%
or our autoimmune receptors
in our intestinal tract.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And our body is
fooled into thinking

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:46.310 align:middle line:90%
that it has what it has.

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:50.489 align:middle line:84%
So we start seeing a
lot of inflammation.

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:54.550 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing massive amounts
of a lot of allergies

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:55.949 align:middle line:90%
that kids never used to have.

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:56.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Leaky gut syndrome.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.338 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
Leaky guts, yep.

00:34:58.338 --> 00:35:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing
asthma off the charts.

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:03.390 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
are feeding this.

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:06.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
wrong with the kids.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.980 align:middle line:90%
We are doing it to them.

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And the GMOs are
screwing up our bodies.

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are going to
have to mutate around this.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And God knows what
that's going to happen.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:19.610 align:middle line:84%
But not only that, but this
stuff is in the food chain.

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:20.979 align:middle line:90%
It's fed to the animals.

00:35:20.979 --> 00:35:21.770 align:middle line:90%
And they eliminate.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:24.920 align:middle line:84%
It gets in the ground, in
the water, and back to us.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And between that
and all the drugs

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:30.505 align:middle line:84%
that are being eliminated
by people every day--

00:35:30.505 --> 00:35:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: An article I read
the other day extended it out

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:38.660 align:middle line:84%
to say by the year-- was it
2050 or so-- we could almost

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:41.420 align:middle line:84%
expect to see every
other child displaying

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:43.925 align:middle line:84%
some of the effects of
what we now call autism.

00:35:43.925 --> 00:35:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
That's not OK.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's not OK.

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
And we can change it.

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And all of these factors
are vitally important.

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And we've been duped
by corporations.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
here in the US.

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:01.335 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:36:01.335 --> 00:36:03.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they're
a little more conscious

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:04.060 align:middle line:90%
in Europe about the GMOs.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
In Europe they

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:06.430 align:middle line:90%
don't allow the GMOs any more.

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:08.380 align:middle line:84%
The European Union
has outlawed them.

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.170 align:middle line:90%
And I love eating over there.

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:11.805 align:middle line:84%
The food actually
tastes like food.

00:36:11.805 --> 00:36:13.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does indeed.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
Depending on where you are.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:15.750 align:middle line:90%
Some's better than others.

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not at the
local McDonald's in Paris.

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
No, we don't go there.

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:22.390 align:middle line:90%
But we've got to get smart.

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Because we're killing our
race with these things.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And I know that's a
very strong statement.

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:29.600 align:middle line:90%
But it's absolutely true.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well there's
evidence for it.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
There's a lot of evidence.

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And I've cited both
sides of the story.

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:37.250 align:middle line:84%
I do want to say
that I'm vaccine pro.

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:38.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm not against vaccines.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.850 align:middle line:90%
They do wonderful things.

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:43.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's what they're using
in them, these materials.

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times it's
just some sort of waste

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.390 align:middle line:90%
that they don't know what to do.

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:49.600 align:middle line:84%
For instance,
fluoride in our water

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:53.994 align:middle line:84%
is a result of too much
nuclear waste fluoride.

00:36:53.994 --> 00:36:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't know
what to do with it.

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:57.230 align:middle line:84%
So they put it in
toothpaste and water.

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:59.188 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well and I
noticed that in your book.

00:36:59.188 --> 00:37:02.340 align:middle line:84%
I was surprised to find out
you weren't anti vaccines.

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:04.780 align:middle line:84%
But you said maybe
what you need to do

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:06.825 align:middle line:84%
is do your own
research into the batch

00:37:06.825 --> 00:37:08.326 align:middle line:84%
and what's in that
particular batch.

00:37:08.326 --> 00:37:10.408 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Yes,
that is actually possible.

00:37:10.408 --> 00:37:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And I put an 800
number in the book.

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:13.490 align:middle line:90%
And there are others.

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And you can ask
the batch number.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:16.364 align:middle line:84%
You can call the
doctor's office.

00:37:16.364 --> 00:37:18.370 align:middle line:84%
What's the batch of the
vaccines you're using?

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And you can call this
800 number and ask

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:24.460 align:middle line:84%
them does it have any
mercury or thimerosal,

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:27.300 align:middle line:84%
or is there any kind
of heavy metal in it,

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:30.450 align:middle line:84%
or are there any industrial
chemical type things.

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:32.620 align:middle line:90%
You can ask those questions.

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And what we need to
do is get diligent.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Because there's so much of this
that has happened so gradually.

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.820 align:middle line:90%
We had no idea.

00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:43.360 align:middle line:84%
But now we're seeing
what it's doing.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:44.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's not OK.

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:47.550 align:middle line:84%
We're talking literally half
the kids that are being born

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:50.290 align:middle line:84%
are being diagnosed
with this stuff.

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:51.300 align:middle line:90%
It's our doing.

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.460 align:middle line:90%
Because we weren't aware.

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.125 align:middle line:90%
And we can change it.

00:37:55.125 --> 00:37:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, on
that note, let's

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.540 align:middle line:84%
start looking at
the actual-- you

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:00.830 align:middle line:84%
call them the different
kinds of kids, generations.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:03.235 align:middle line:84%
But generation doesn't
mean a 30 year gap between.

00:38:03.235 --> 00:38:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: No.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It just
means different types

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:07.140 align:middle line:90%
of beings being born.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's fair to start out
with the bridge generation.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.070 align:middle line:90%
You alluded to it earlier.

00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And you said we're part
of the bridge generation.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.939 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
their characteristics.

00:38:14.939 --> 00:38:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Because I think our
viewers are going

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.620 align:middle line:84%
to start seeing
bits of themselves

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.380 align:middle line:90%
or their children in this story.

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Yeah,
I get so many e-mails.

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:23.630 align:middle line:90%
I have all those traits.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:24.588 align:middle line:90%
What does that make me?

00:38:24.588 --> 00:38:25.680 align:middle line:90%
And they're 60 years old.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.080 align:middle line:90%


00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.320 align:middle line:84%
I want to preface
this by saying I'm not

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.960 align:middle line:90%
about labeling the kids.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.249 align:middle line:90%
I'm so not about that.

00:38:35.249 --> 00:38:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're
known for your labels.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
I know, right?

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you created some
of this terminology that's

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:41.190 align:middle line:90%
now used everywhere.

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
I actually did.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.380 align:middle line:90%
I coined most of these terms.

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:44.088 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:38:44.088 --> 00:38:45.960 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you did.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.749 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: And the first
one is actually a seminal work.

00:38:48.749 --> 00:38:50.040 align:middle line:90%
They're using it for research--

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The bridge generation.

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: --for
PhD papers and all of that.

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:54.176 align:middle line:90%
"The First Children of Now."

00:38:54.176 --> 00:38:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, I had to find
a way to communicate.

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:02.720 align:middle line:84%
How do I talk about
these different children?

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And so in my mind I
gave them a little names

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.640 align:middle line:84%
so that I could keep track
of what I was learning.

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up doing
it in the book.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.260 align:middle line:90%
And I wish I hadn't.

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:13.730 align:middle line:90%
But I'm glad I did.

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, the bridge
generation is us.

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:20.060 align:middle line:84%
We're the people that,
in varying degrees,

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:24.480 align:middle line:84%
had an intuitive nature,
are very sensitive.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.285 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us have low
basal temperatures.

00:39:26.285 --> 00:39:29.270 align:middle line:90%


00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:32.080 align:middle line:90%
And we know we need to go home.

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.940 align:middle line:84%
But we can't
remember where it is.

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:36.050 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people say that.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:39.790 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people know who's on
the phone before they answer,

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:42.889 align:middle line:84%
and just a lot of little
sixth sense kind of things.

00:39:42.889 --> 00:39:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where the sixth
sense is starting to open up,

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.550 align:middle line:90%
but not fully blown open.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Exactly.

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:48.976 align:middle line:84%
Well that's what I
call the sixth sense.

00:39:48.976 --> 00:39:51.220 align:middle line:84%
The sixth sense are the
hints, or the little pieces,

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.970 align:middle line:84%
that oh, woo, something's
going to happen.

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Or gee, I see something out
of the corner of my eye.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's gone--
that kind of thing.

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:00.940 align:middle line:90%
But we had that.

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And it was scary, because
people didn't believe us.

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.010 align:middle line:90%
Or they made fun of us.

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people-- I didn't--
but a lot of people turned it

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:10.230 align:middle line:90%
off.

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And now we're having
trouble getting back to it.

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:16.280 align:middle line:84%
But many, many of
us started exploring

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.150 align:middle line:90%
that part of our nature.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the whole
spiritualist and then

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:23.351 align:middle line:84%
later spiritualism
movement came from.

00:40:23.351 --> 00:40:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.800 align:middle line:84%
That was my next
question about that.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.140 align:middle line:84%
That's the generation
that really got going.

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.681 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: That's what
happens when you're intuitive.

00:40:29.681 --> 00:40:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's how that
started was us just trying

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.040 align:middle line:90%
to figure out what the heck.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And more and more of
us started doing that.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And there is a
scientific principle

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:41.185 align:middle line:84%
called the hundredth monkey
theory, which we've all

00:40:41.185 --> 00:40:43.330 align:middle line:90%
probably heard of ad nauseam.

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:45.760 align:middle line:90%
But we did that.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.520 align:middle line:84%
By so many of us
exploring who we are

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:53.280 align:middle line:84%
and what we're
capable of we created

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:57.450 align:middle line:84%
a point of critical mass where
now it is becoming normal.

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:01.110 align:middle line:84%
And more and more
people are able to do.

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:03.610 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed that
with my own students.

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:07.590 align:middle line:84%
In my certification program,
the first year they struggled.

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:11.310 align:middle line:84%
The next year the class
was so much more quick.

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And this last year
was mind blowing.

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:16.710 align:middle line:84%
They were masters by
the end of the year.

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And one of my students
that's been with me

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:21.510 align:middle line:84%
since the beginning was standing
against the wall laughing.

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:23.210 align:middle line:90%
And she said what's going on?

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:24.362 align:middle line:10%
And I stood there a minute.

00:41:24.362 --> 00:41:26.070 align:middle line:10%
And I said I'll tell
you what's going on.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:29.750 align:middle line:10%
It's because of you,
and you, and you.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Each one of us that
does this makes

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:34.170 align:middle line:90%
it easier for the next guy.

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:36.720 align:middle line:90%
So that makes us the bridge.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we started giving
birth to some of the others.

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: And as we
have raised our consciousness,

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and opened our hearts, and our
beingness to something greater,

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:54.840 align:middle line:84%
we have developed that
nature and given it

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:58.580 align:middle line:84%
to our children, who
realize it more fully

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:00.186 align:middle line:90%
than we even still do.

00:42:00.186 --> 00:42:03.010 align:middle line:90%


00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Because so many of
us made it so normal,

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:10.190 align:middle line:84%
the children are
actually just coming in

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:12.960 align:middle line:84%
with remembering
where they came from.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And they're able to do
all kinds of things.

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, until they're
socialized, at about age seven,

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.390 align:middle line:90%
they start to forget.

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Because they're taught
no, that's not OK.

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:24.510 align:middle line:90%
That's not real.

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:26.350 align:middle line:84%
You're not looking at
an angel in the room.

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They become educated.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Yes.

00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:30.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's talk
about the next one, the Indigo

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:30.840 align:middle line:90%
Children.

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the term
everybody's aware of.

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And how did that
term really come--

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:36.580 align:middle line:90%
why did that term come to be?

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:37.955 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
That term came

00:42:37.955 --> 00:42:41.990 align:middle line:84%
to be because somebody sees
like I do, to some degree,

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:44.240 align:middle line:84%
noticed that a certain
set of children,

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:47.380 align:middle line:84%
who had certain traits,
like I did later,

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:51.830 align:middle line:84%
had completely indigo blue
fields, that external field

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:53.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:57.450 align:middle line:90%
And thus she coined that term.

00:42:57.450 --> 00:43:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the term came from.

00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Because their whole energy
field was deep indigo blue.

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Well they're the
paradigm breakers.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.410 align:middle line:84%
They were the ones that
wouldn't follow rules in school

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:14.630 align:middle line:84%
because they were really and
truly for somebody else's

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:15.360 align:middle line:90%
convenience.

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.730 align:middle line:90%
And they'd say so.

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:18.040 align:middle line:90%
That has nothing to do with me.

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:21.730 align:middle line:84%
That's for you to do whatever
you want for the next hour.

00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:22.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing it.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when did roughly--
how old would they be now?

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:25.780 align:middle line:84%
When did that first wave
start coming through?

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: They
would be in their mid

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.750 align:middle line:84%
to late 30s, the
earlier Indigos.

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mid to late 30s.

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: And
none of this is in stone.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No I understand.

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:33.020 align:middle line:84%
These are generalities
we're speaking in now.

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.353 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Well the
reason is it's an evolution.

00:43:35.353 --> 00:43:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And there are early comers
and there are late comers.

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So the Indigos
happened for a while.

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:44.920 align:middle line:90%


00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And they're very artful
and very open hearted

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and laid back,
kind of hippie-ish

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:52.670 align:middle line:84%
almost in their attitude,
just like whatever.

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:56.830 align:middle line:90%


00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're not
super ambitious in the way

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:00.090 align:middle line:84%
that the previous
generations were.

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Exactly.

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:00.930 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:02.710 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't find the words.

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:07.420 align:middle line:84%
They're just more like whoa,
right now what's going on?

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.330 align:middle line:90%
And they seemed disrespectful.

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:14.440 align:middle line:84%
But in fact they were
just being normal.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
the first awareness

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:20.506 align:middle line:84%
we had that something was
happening in a new generation.

00:44:20.506 --> 00:44:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Didn't a lot of
them really embrace weed?

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Oh
yeah, a lot of them

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.030 align:middle line:90%
smoked a lot of dope.

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
smoking a lot of weed.

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: That's why
I said they were hippie-ish.

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were just
hanging in the moment.

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Yeah,
they did a lot of that,

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.780 align:middle line:90%
did a lot of that.

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And they're in their
mid to late 30s.

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And what's really fun is they're
having Crystalline Kids now.

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's
start talking about them.

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: So they're
really an actual earlier

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:48.030 align:middle line:84%
generation, not a full
20 years, but as I'm

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:50.200 align:middle line:90%
going to talk about it right.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Crystalline Kids?

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:53.050 align:middle line:90%
Or are we still on the Indigos?

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: The
indigos were first.

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we went
through a time where

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.780 align:middle line:90%
I call the Transitional Kids.

00:44:58.780 --> 00:44:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: And we
still have them every day.

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:06.430 align:middle line:84%
The Transitionals are the dark
side of this beautiful thing,

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:08.170 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:10.030 align:middle line:84%
But in another way
they're very beautiful.

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:13.350 align:middle line:84%
They are highly,
highly sensitive,

00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:18.720 align:middle line:84%
but not as brilliantly
intuitive as the Crystallines

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.080 align:middle line:90%
that came later.

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.060 align:middle line:84%
They had a real mixed
bag of energies.

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.900 align:middle line:84%
They had a little of
the Indigo, some stuff.

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:26.430 align:middle line:90%
We were in a transitory time.

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:29.970 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't get a
refinement of energies.

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Because we the bridge
generation were

00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:34.280 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure things
out for ourselves.

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.713 align:middle line:84%
So we weren't passing on a
clear message to the babies

00:45:36.713 --> 00:45:38.860 align:middle line:90%
yet, frankly.

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:41.450 align:middle line:84%
So you get these kids
that are really sensitive

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:45.990 align:middle line:84%
and don't know how to express
it, don't even understand--

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No one to really
mentor or guide them.

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:49.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Well
we didn't have a clue.

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And so what a lot of them
did was they internalized.

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And they started to get
really low self-esteem.

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:03.340 align:middle line:84%
They started to self
medicate-- drugs, alcohol.

00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So these kids are--
there's a term called the Lost

00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:07.080 align:middle line:90%
Generation.

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.171 align:middle line:84%
Might these be
some of these kids?

00:46:09.171 --> 00:46:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.590 align:middle line:90%
And that's the way it appears.

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Because they're so internalized
that we really don't

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:17.820 align:middle line:90%
have an idea what's going on.

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
easy to get to talk.

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:22.680 align:middle line:90%
Because they go so deep.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can't draw
them out, necessarily.

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
Well once they're

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.250 align:middle line:90%
in their teens it's impossible.

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm advocating
is get your child

00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:36.420 align:middle line:84%
to communicate as
soon as they hit air.

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:37.680 align:middle line:90%
Start communicating.

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:40.120 align:middle line:90%
And keep them feeling safe.

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.710 align:middle line:84%
In our generation,
and prior generations,

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:44.910 align:middle line:84%
if we said something, we
were criticized for it.

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Or we were told no,
that's wrong, or whatever.

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:49.720 align:middle line:90%
What I say is listen deeply.

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:50.470 align:middle line:90%
Don't judge.

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:51.580 align:middle line:90%
Don't criticize.

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:53.295 align:middle line:90%
See what they have to say.

00:46:53.295 --> 00:46:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Because what they're
saying is amazing.

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's brilliant.

00:46:56.250 --> 00:47:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with the
Transitionals we went through,

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:03.320 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
through it again,

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.950 align:middle line:84%
we've seen a lot of
teen suicides, which

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:07.830 align:middle line:90%
is heartbreaking.

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:10.840 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how many
families I worked with that

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:11.764 align:middle line:90%
went through that.

00:47:11.764 --> 00:47:12.555 align:middle line:90%
It's heartbreaking.

00:47:12.555 --> 00:47:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And precursors to
that are cutting themselves?

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
Well what happens

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:20.460 align:middle line:84%
is they get desensitized
internalizing,

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:23.510 align:middle line:84%
they cut themselves so
they can feel something,

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:24.860 align:middle line:90%
so they know they're alive.

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Because they shut
down so completely.

00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
piece of that is

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:34.190 align:middle line:84%
what we've been seeing
the last several years is

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:39.700 align:middle line:84%
that now that we've got
them even more sensitive,

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:44.350 align:middle line:84%
more technology available,
different things that

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:47.670 align:middle line:84%
communicate to this, when
they internalize they build

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:50.150 align:middle line:84%
these fantasy worlds,
like the superheroes

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:53.620 align:middle line:84%
in their video games, or
like the special effects

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:55.300 align:middle line:90%
in the movies that are so real.

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.680 align:middle line:90%
And they build up this fantasy.

00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:59.270 align:middle line:90%
And then they act on it.

00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And when they do,
they go to a school

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:03.500 align:middle line:84%
and shoot a bunch of
people and kill them.

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:08.430 align:middle line:84%
The kid at Virginia Tech was
a perfect example of this.

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Two days after he committed
the acts that killed 30

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:16.510 align:middle line:84%
some people, including
himself, a local news station

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:18.710 align:middle line:84%
received a packet
from him showing him

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:21.980 align:middle line:84%
in all these martial
arts poses with weapons

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:23.230 align:middle line:90%
of a different nature.

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:25.070 align:middle line:90%
That was his fantasy world.

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:26.210 align:middle line:90%
And that's what he did.

00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:28.687 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there's no
line between the two anymore.

00:48:28.687 --> 00:48:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: He
had been hospitalized.

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.030 align:middle line:90%
He had been medicated.

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:34.110 align:middle line:84%
He had been through
all the stuff

00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:36.130 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these
transitional kids did.

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:37.570 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you're broken.

00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:38.590 align:middle line:90%
You need drugs.

00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:40.000 align:middle line:90%
You need a psychiatrist.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:40.610 align:middle line:90%
You need this.

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:41.300 align:middle line:90%
You need that.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:42.444 align:middle line:90%
No, no, that's--

00:48:42.444 --> 00:48:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Most of these
shooters are on drugs.

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Yeah.

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're on
prescription drugs.

00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:47.254 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Exactly.

00:48:47.254 --> 00:48:48.480 align:middle line:90%
And those drugs--

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.514 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Psychoactive drugs.

00:48:50.514 --> 00:48:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
It was so cool.

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Because yesterday
at the airport I

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:58.710 align:middle line:84%
met a woman who oversees
some of these drug trials.

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:01.432 align:middle line:84%
And she won't work
the ADD, ADHD drugs.

00:49:01.432 --> 00:49:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Because she knows
what's happening.

00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:03.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my gosh, yeah.

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:05.806 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: And
it was just interesting

00:49:05.806 --> 00:49:08.500 align:middle line:84%
that it happened on the way
here, like things always do.

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:12.880 align:middle line:84%
But these drugs are
made for adult people.

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:15.970 align:middle line:84%
They're not made for
developing minds.

00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And kids in their teens
are going through so much,

00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:23.890 align:middle line:84%
developmentally and
physically developmentally,

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:27.400 align:middle line:84%
that what's happening is
these drugs are causing

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.790 align:middle line:90%
psychiatric symptomologies.

00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately we're
starting to see it revealed

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:33.844 align:middle line:90%
in some pretty ugly ways.

00:49:33.844 --> 00:49:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and I think
we can all relate to that

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:36.460 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:37.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
It's in the news.

00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We all
see the headlines.

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:39.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we all see it.

00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
It's in the news.

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:42.455 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now let's go on
to the Crystalline generation.

00:49:42.455 --> 00:49:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Love to.

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they're
really interesting.

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: The
Crystalline kids are amazing.

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:52.040 align:middle line:84%
They started coming in
around the late 1990s-- '97,

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.100 align:middle line:90%
'98, right in there.

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I
picked up with the kids.

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:58.910 align:middle line:90%
And they are amazing.

00:49:58.910 --> 00:50:02.920 align:middle line:90%
They are natural born healers.

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:07.180 align:middle line:84%
They can work energy
like a master.

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:08.300 align:middle line:90%
They're intuitive.

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:09.960 align:middle line:90%
They see other dimensionally.

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:13.310 align:middle line:84%
They see people on the other
side that have passed away.

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:16.800 align:middle line:84%
They see the angelic realm
and everything in between.

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.350 align:middle line:84%
They will often say they
remember talking to God

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:21.810 align:middle line:90%
or picking their parents.

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:23.410 align:middle line:90%
I was referring to them earlier.

00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:24.155 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:24.155 --> 00:50:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: And
they're like old, wise beings,

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:28.800 align:middle line:90%
wise old--

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.466 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
said also charismatic.

00:50:30.466 --> 00:50:32.940 align:middle line:84%
They walk into a room and
everyone feels their presence.

00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:34.731 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: You
want something done,

00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:36.370 align:middle line:84%
you give it to a
Crystalline kid.

00:50:36.370 --> 00:50:39.900 align:middle line:84%
When Hailey was six-- I
used to burn my own CDs.

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:40.800 align:middle line:90%
I was starting out.

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.390 align:middle line:90%
And I was low on funds.

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:45.960 align:middle line:90%
And I packaged everything.

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:47.890 align:middle line:90%
I did back then.

00:50:47.890 --> 00:50:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And the three of them
came to visit me.

00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.930 align:middle line:90%
Hailey was six.

00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And the other two were--
Josh is a year behind.

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And Devon was four years
later or something.

00:50:58.180 --> 00:50:59.660 align:middle line:90%
So he was a little bitty guy.

00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And I told Hailey, I said,
honey, I need 500 CDs done.

00:51:04.170 --> 00:51:06.120 align:middle line:90%
And this is how it works.

00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And would you get
your brothers to help?

00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:13.400 align:middle line:84%
They packaged 500,
CDs, from burning them,

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:17.830 align:middle line:84%
to putting labels on the CDs,
to packaging them in packages

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:19.710 align:middle line:90%
and shrink wrapping them.

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And then, in entire
batch of 500-- and it

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:24.900 align:middle line:90%
was six different CDs.

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:31.030 align:middle line:84%
In an entire batch of 500
CDs, my six-year-old grandkid

00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:33.850 align:middle line:84%
ran a crew of kids
littler than her.

00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:36.330 align:middle line:84%
There was only one CD
that had a problem.

00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:37.020 align:middle line:90%
It was empty.

00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Somebody got excited
about the shrink wrap.

00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
they are though.

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
the Crystalline Kids.

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.450 align:middle line:90%
So they take charge.

00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:46.010 align:middle line:84%
They are connected
with the larger picture

00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:49.334 align:middle line:84%
too, with the Earth, with
the problems resulting--

00:51:49.334 --> 00:51:51.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: They're
more socially interested.

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:53.030 align:middle line:84%
The star kids are
more Earth interested.

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.738 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:51:53.738 --> 00:51:54.238 align:middle line:90%
So, OK.

00:51:54.238 --> 00:51:56.112 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: It's
a beautiful marriage.

00:51:56.112 --> 00:51:58.050 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see
that in a minute.

00:51:58.050 --> 00:52:00.790 align:middle line:84%
The Crystalline kids
notice things socially.

00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:05.430 align:middle line:84%
When they get to be about age
10 or 11-- oh, and by the way,

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:09.480 align:middle line:84%
they don't handle it when things
around them get real stressed.

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Some of them will have seizures
or different things happen.

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Because their system
is so finely tuned.

00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.960 align:middle line:90%
They get on overloads.

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:19.190 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of anger
or a lot of-- the parents

00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:21.030 align:middle line:90%
are fighting or something.

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:24.390 align:middle line:84%
I've seen them have seizures
or have weird events.

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:26.070 align:middle line:90%
Because it's too much for them.

00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:27.820 align:middle line:84%
When they're little--
they grow out of it.

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:29.319 align:middle line:84%
But when they're
first here, they're

00:52:29.319 --> 00:52:31.110 align:middle line:90%
very sensitive, more sensitive.

00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll talk about what
it's like on the other side

00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:37.070 align:middle line:90%
and what they remember.

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about past lives,
as we said before and different

00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:42.910 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And by the time they're 10
or 11, their shift changes.

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:49.980 align:middle line:90%
They become very socially aware.

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And you can count the
clock by 10 or 11.

00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:53.550 align:middle line:90%
Usually it's 11.

00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:55.598 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Social
consciousness develops.

00:52:55.598 --> 00:52:57.473 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: It's
like some door opens.

00:52:57.473 --> 00:53:00.910 align:middle line:90%


00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:02.640 align:middle line:90%
And I know a lot of these kids.

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:05.700 align:middle line:84%
I knew one whose
principal from school

00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:09.770 align:middle line:84%
called to a single mom, who
was very hard working and very

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:10.270 align:middle line:90%
busy.

00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And he says well, we're
having a food drive at school.

00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:15.291 align:middle line:84%
And she says OK,
I'll send something.

00:53:15.291 --> 00:53:15.790 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:53:15.790 --> 00:53:17.320 align:middle line:90%
She's a busy mom, whatever.

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:19.330 align:middle line:84%
He says no, you
don't understand.

00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Your son, Peter, who was 10
at the time, arranged this.

00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And he's having us do this
because not all lunches are

00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.990 align:middle line:90%
equal.

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:30.860 align:middle line:90%
And some kids didn't have them.

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:32.482 align:middle line:90%
And he got upset about it.

00:53:32.482 --> 00:53:33.690 align:middle line:90%
And it was just mind blowing.

00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:35.315 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew him
since he was little.

00:53:35.315 --> 00:53:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
They do things--

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:43.560 align:middle line:84%
my granddaughter, her aunt on
the other side of the family

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:46.340 align:middle line:84%
had pancreatic cancer
and passed from it.

00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:47.470 align:middle line:90%
And Hailey was furious.

00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't know that
much about pancreatic cancer.

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:52.420 align:middle line:84%
So she started
weaving bracelets.

00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:55.750 align:middle line:90%
Now, she was like 10.

00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:58.155 align:middle line:90%
She started weaving bracelets.

00:53:58.155 --> 00:53:59.155 align:middle line:90%
And they were beautiful.

00:53:59.155 --> 00:54:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And she'd sell
them for $1 to $3,

00:54:01.090 --> 00:54:03.460 align:middle line:84%
depending on how
intricate they were.

00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:08.477 align:middle line:84%
And before I knew, she was
running 47 kids making these.

00:54:08.477 --> 00:54:10.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She had a
little sweat shop.

00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Yeah,
out of the school library.

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:12.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god.

00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:15.179 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: And they
were on the regional news.

00:54:15.179 --> 00:54:15.930 align:middle line:90%
It was a big deal.

00:54:15.930 --> 00:54:17.388 align:middle line:84%
And they contributed
all this money

00:54:17.388 --> 00:54:20.104 align:middle line:84%
they made to cancer research
for pancreatic cancer.

00:54:20.104 --> 00:54:22.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they have a love
of their fellow human being.

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:24.084 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
They love people.

00:54:24.084 --> 00:54:25.500 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they've
been known to say

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.780 align:middle line:84%
they've come here because
they want to teach us

00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:30.370 align:middle line:84%
how to love ourselves
and each other,

00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:32.960 align:middle line:90%
because we've forgotten how.

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:35.770 align:middle line:84%
When they first started
coming that was the main thing

00:54:35.770 --> 00:54:37.650 align:middle line:90%
they said first.

00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:39.000 align:middle line:90%
You don't remember how to love.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm here to remind you.

00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now what
about the star kids?

00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
And so the star kids

00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:48.240 align:middle line:84%
are like the other half
of the yin and yang.

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:52.140 align:middle line:84%
We've got the Crystalline
kids who are beautifully all

00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:57.180 align:middle line:84%
about the heart, all about
society, all about acting,

00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:58.990 align:middle line:90%
acting on it.

00:54:58.990 --> 00:55:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And then we get the star
kids, who are-- they

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:05.252 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of the
same giftedness.

00:55:05.252 --> 00:55:06.210 align:middle line:90%
I hate using that word.

00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:07.340 align:middle line:90%
Because it's really who we are.

00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I agree.

00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:08.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't like the word.

00:55:08.770 --> 00:55:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: But they
have a lot of the abilities

00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:11.235 align:middle line:90%
that the Crystallines have.

00:55:11.235 --> 00:55:12.590 align:middle line:90%
There's a crossover here.

00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:16.050 align:middle line:84%
The difference is that the star
kids are very, very concerned

00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:19.790 align:middle line:84%
about the condition of the Earth
and how we're living on it.

00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And they're all--
everyone I've known

00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:28.850 align:middle line:84%
has been real into the animals
and how they're OK or not OK.

00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:32.095 align:middle line:84%
And they're highly
technologically oriented.

00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:33.970 align:middle line:84%
I had one little guy
who was seven years old,

00:55:33.970 --> 00:55:37.040 align:middle line:84%
came walking in for a session
with me one day with his mom,

00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:40.870 align:middle line:84%
and he had a book that was
like a coffee size table book.

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was all about the
history of airplanes.

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:45.889 align:middle line:84%
Now this kid's seven
years old in feet pajamas

00:55:45.889 --> 00:55:46.680 align:middle line:90%
coming to visit me.

00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And I thought well,
my dad was a pilot.

00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:48.808 align:middle line:90%
I'll start there.

00:55:48.808 --> 00:55:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get to
know each other.

00:55:50.890 --> 00:55:53.740 align:middle line:84%
So he says what year
was your dad a pilot?

00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:54.580 align:middle line:90%
And I told him.

00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And he says OK, well
here's what he flew.

00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:59.730 align:middle line:90%
Here's how the hydraulics work.

00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:02.580 align:middle line:84%
Here's what type
of fuel it used.

00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:04.330 align:middle line:90%
Here was the ratio.

00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:07.891 align:middle line:84%
He told me stuff like an
engineer probably didn't even

00:56:07.891 --> 00:56:08.390 align:middle line:90%
know.

00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:09.515 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And he was seven.

00:56:09.515 --> 00:56:10.690 align:middle line:90%
Why was he there to see you?

00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:14.292 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Because
he was having problems, not

00:56:14.292 --> 00:56:15.750 align:middle line:84%
sitting still, a
lot of this stuff.

00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:16.964 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, fidgety.

00:56:16.964 --> 00:56:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: And he
said a lot of weird stuff.

00:56:19.130 --> 00:56:21.100 align:middle line:90%
Well I had him on the table.

00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
I know, he and I

00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:26.830 align:middle line:84%
are talking multi-dimensionality
like it's over coffee.

00:56:26.830 --> 00:56:29.450 align:middle line:90%
And this kid was amazing.

00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And oh I know, he wasn't
doing well in school.

00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And I said OK, so
how come you're not

00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:35.940 align:middle line:90%
doing well on your tests?

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:37.770 align:middle line:84%
From what I can tell,
you're brilliant.

00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:39.760 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think
you're a genius.

00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:41.070 align:middle line:90%
What's up?

00:56:41.070 --> 00:56:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And he says to me you
know-- very seriously--

00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:47.890 align:middle line:84%
by the time they
give us a test, it's

00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:49.950 align:middle line:90%
a week later or a month later.

00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:50.710 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:51.650 align:middle line:90%
And I've done that.

00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm light years
ahead of that.

00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:56.540 align:middle line:84%
So why should I try to go
backwards when I'm learning

00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:58.181 align:middle line:90%
so much more right now?

00:56:58.181 --> 00:56:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, god.

00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: And I stood
there and I thought you know--

00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:02.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're right, kid.

00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Yeah.

00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:04.050 align:middle line:90%
That's a good point.

00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:05.841 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is
a good example of what

00:57:05.841 --> 00:57:07.100 align:middle line:90%
the star children are like.

00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
Yeah, they need

00:57:09.830 --> 00:57:11.960 align:middle line:90%
a lot to keep their minds busy.

00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.260 align:middle line:90%
They're really brilliant.

00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:15.023 align:middle line:90%
And they love to invent things.

00:57:15.023 --> 00:57:17.770 align:middle line:90%


00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:21.260 align:middle line:84%
They're the opposite
of the Crystallines

00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:22.700 align:middle line:90%
are all about the heart.

00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:25.450 align:middle line:84%
These guys are all about the
technology and the knowledge,

00:57:25.450 --> 00:57:30.730 align:middle line:84%
and they're like the bringers
of what we need to know.

00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And so later we're going to
have a perfect dichotomy,

00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:37.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean a perfect yin and
yang, of the Crystallines

00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:42.230 align:middle line:84%
on one side of it and the
star kids on the other side.

00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:45.880 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
people and the world all

00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:49.630 align:middle line:84%
being tied together by these
two different types of kids,

00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:51.600 align:middle line:84%
who will be running our
world at some point.

00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know, I'm
so excited for that day

00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
And I can't wait.

00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I feel the same way.

00:57:54.850 --> 00:57:56.160 align:middle line:90%
OK, Children of Light.

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
Children of Light.

00:57:57.050 --> 00:57:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that's
a little different gig.

00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:03.886 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Eight
years ago-- no, 10 years ago--

00:58:03.886 --> 00:58:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
their energy field, too.

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:07.269 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: I'm going to.

00:58:07.269 --> 00:58:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and I didn't with the
Crystalline Kids and the Star

00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:10.060 align:middle line:90%
Kids.

00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:11.820 align:middle line:84%
I do want to make
one point with that.

00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:13.910 align:middle line:90%
And then I'll move to that.

00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:16.660 align:middle line:84%
The Crystalline Kids, when I
first started noticing them,

00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:19.540 align:middle line:84%
their energy fields moved really
fast, like a search light,

00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:22.380 align:middle line:84%
like searching, searching,
information, information.

00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And they were indigo
blue, and deep burgundy,

00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:27.310 align:middle line:90%
and forest green--

00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of
jewel tone colors.

00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:30.351 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
Jewel tone colors.

00:58:30.351 --> 00:58:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And over time, as their
energies have refined,

00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and the consciousness
has opened farther,

00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:36.750 align:middle line:84%
that has lightened and
lightened and lightened.

00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:40.180 align:middle line:84%
So we hear Rainbow
Children, Dolphin Children,

00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:40.950 align:middle line:90%
blah, blah, blah.

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:42.110 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same.

00:58:42.110 --> 00:58:44.540 align:middle line:84%
It's just a part
of the evolution.

00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:48.370 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening is-- and
10 years ago my guys, as I call

00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:52.490 align:middle line:84%
them, told me eight
years from this date

00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:55.930 align:middle line:84%
you will begin to see
a new type of child.

00:58:55.930 --> 00:58:57.830 align:middle line:90%
And I was like cool.

00:58:57.830 --> 00:59:00.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't ever ask who,
what, why, or where.

00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:01.650 align:middle line:90%
I let things be what they are.

00:59:01.650 --> 00:59:03.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, awesome.

00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And I told the person I was
having dinner with well,

00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:07.460 align:middle line:90%
there's going to be more.

00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And within the last couple of
years they've started coming.

00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really know
what they can do yet.

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:14.780 align:middle line:90%
Because they're so little.

00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:15.740 align:middle line:90%
They're babies.

00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:17.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are these the Children
of Light we're speaking of?

00:59:17.130 --> 00:59:19.129 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: The
Children of Light, right.

00:59:19.129 --> 00:59:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And I call them that because
their energy fields are

00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:25.030 align:middle line:90%
pure white, pure white energy.

00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Total
synthesis of all colors.

00:59:27.010 --> 00:59:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Exactly.

00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:28.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:59:28.890 --> 00:59:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: They
have infinite possibility

00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:32.780 align:middle line:90%
in their makeup.

00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:34.050 align:middle line:90%
They aren't limited.

00:59:34.050 --> 00:59:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Like the earlier generations, if
you want to call it something,

00:59:40.690 --> 00:59:43.540 align:middle line:90%
have some variance from us.

00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:47.260 align:middle line:84%
These guys are an assimilation
of all of that progress

00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:49.660 align:middle line:90%
in the evolution of humanity.

00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Unbelievable-- I can't wait
to see what they can do.

00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:53.003 align:middle line:90%
I'm just starting to get--

00:59:53.003 --> 00:59:55.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your inclination,
in observing them now,

00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:58.210 align:middle line:84%
is to believe that they
are here to just be

00:59:58.210 --> 01:00:00.171 align:middle line:90%
and uphold an energy?

01:00:00.171 --> 01:00:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
I don't know yet.

01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not to do a lot?

01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: The truth--

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you don't know.

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
I don't know yet.

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:06.100 align:middle line:90%
But here's what I really think.

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.580 align:middle line:90%
I think you're right.

01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:11.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't like to use the word--
what I know is you're right.

01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And I also feel like they're
going to be like I am.

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:19.790 align:middle line:84%
I learned how to be able to
reach my consciousness out

01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:24.290 align:middle line:84%
and pick up information out
of the common consciousness.

01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:27.255 align:middle line:90%
And I do that, just naturally.

01:00:27.255 --> 01:00:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And my sense is
that they're going

01:00:30.370 --> 01:00:33.880 align:middle line:90%
to have this ability, innately.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:36.200 align:middle line:10%
That's my sense.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.790 align:middle line:10%
Because of the way that
I see their energy,

01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:42.110 align:middle line:10%
and it's very fluid.

01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:45.460 align:middle line:90%
It's very calm.

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:47.620 align:middle line:90%
It's like a field of light.

01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:50.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not like all these
other kids, whose fields

01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:52.680 align:middle line:90%
moved and picked up stuff.

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:55.937 align:middle line:84%
These guys are like the
total sentient being.

01:00:55.937 --> 01:00:56.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: So I can't
wait to see what happens.

01:00:59.210 --> 01:01:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How they
start expressing.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.320 align:middle line:84%
But you can see it in
their little eyes and such,

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.320 align:middle line:90%
and their little beings.

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
Oh my god, yeah.

01:01:04.810 --> 01:01:07.619 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That quiet, just
wide open and scanning.

01:01:07.619 --> 01:01:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
Yeah, when they're

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:10.370 align:middle line:90%
born they're often quiet.

01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And they look
directly at people.

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And they even smile,
which they say kids can't

01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:18.210 align:middle line:90%
do at that-- I know different.

01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:25.110 align:middle line:84%
I've been in a lot of births and
seen them-- luckily, awesomely.

01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now
let's go, because we're

01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:30.700 align:middle line:84%
starting to run toward
the end of our time,

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:33.970 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about
angels on Earth.

01:01:33.970 --> 01:01:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: They are
the smallest of the categories,

01:01:38.310 --> 01:01:41.780 align:middle line:84%
if you will, in numbers,
but some of the most

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:44.600 align:middle line:90%
profound people I've ever met.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And there are people who
know, without a doubt,

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:50.260 align:middle line:90%
that they have wings.

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:54.610 align:middle line:84%
They can feel them, but
nobody can see them.

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know
what to do with them.

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And they are so deeply,
deeply intrinsically sensitive

01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:07.330 align:middle line:84%
that they are affected
by everything.

01:02:07.330 --> 01:02:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And so many of them are very sad
or try to give themselves away.

01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:15.334 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
find their way.

01:02:15.334 --> 01:02:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Because they know there's
something really different

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:18.979 align:middle line:90%
about them.

01:02:18.979 --> 01:02:20.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether
they're actually

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:23.740 align:middle line:84%
descendants from when the
angels fell and bred with us,

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:26.290 align:middle line:84%
or it's some other
kind of a thing.

01:02:26.290 --> 01:02:27.140 align:middle line:90%
I really don't.

01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Know but it's a very
real phenomenon.

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:30.624 align:middle line:90%
And I can see them.

01:02:30.624 --> 01:02:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
one girl you wrote about.

01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:34.449 align:middle line:90%
I loved this story in your book.

01:02:34.449 --> 01:02:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
She's my favorite.

01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:38.570 align:middle line:90%


01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:42.150 align:middle line:84%
I was in Canada
teaching a workshop.

01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing private
sessions on the off class days.

01:02:46.450 --> 01:02:47.780 align:middle line:90%
And her mom brought her to me.

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And I said OK,
what are we doing?

01:02:51.850 --> 01:02:52.440 align:middle line:90%
Talk to me.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.695 align:middle line:90%
Because I never assume anything.

01:02:54.695 --> 01:02:55.195 align:middle line:90%
I listen.

01:02:55.195 --> 01:02:59.880 align:middle line:90%


01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And she was really
coming very open with me.

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her mom
to leave the room.

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:08.510 align:middle line:84%
I said I promise
you she is safe.

01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:10.350 align:middle line:84%
I just feel like
she's not talking

01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:11.792 align:middle line:90%
to me because you're here.

01:03:11.792 --> 01:03:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And I said that in
front of the daughter.

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.870 align:middle line:90%
And then the mom went out.

01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:17.620 align:middle line:90%
And I said OK, let's have it.

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:20.350 align:middle line:90%
She said I have wings.

01:03:20.350 --> 01:03:23.360 align:middle line:90%
I said I know.

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:24.690 align:middle line:90%
I said what color are they?

01:03:24.690 --> 01:03:26.400 align:middle line:90%
I was validating me.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:27.830 align:middle line:90%
Well, they're light blue.

01:03:27.830 --> 01:03:28.970 align:middle line:90%
I said OK.

01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:30.850 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what I am seeing.

01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:33.400 align:middle line:84%
She says yeah, and I'm so
frustrated-- she's a teenager,

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:35.650 align:middle line:84%
right-- I'm so frustrated
because nobody can see them.

01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:36.820 align:middle line:90%
So you know what I did?

01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:39.410 align:middle line:90%
I had them tattooed on my back.

01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:40.410 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like seriously?

01:03:40.410 --> 01:03:41.730 align:middle line:90%
Can I see them?

01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:42.780 align:middle line:90%
And she sat up.

01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:45.979 align:middle line:84%
And her entire
back-- it was artful.

01:03:45.979 --> 01:03:46.770 align:middle line:90%
It was magnificent.

01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:51.120 align:middle line:84%
It was these beautiful,
living-- I don't know.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.680 align:middle line:84%
I actually went to the artist
myself and talked to him.

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:58.910 align:middle line:84%
They were like alive they
were so well-- every feather.

01:03:58.910 --> 01:04:01.560 align:middle line:90%
They had movement.

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.760 align:middle line:90%
They were art.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.610 align:middle line:84%
But they were so
much more than that.

01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And it made her feel
better that people

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:09.069 align:middle line:84%
could see that she had wings,
even if they were a tattoo.

01:04:09.069 --> 01:04:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What happened
to her after she realized

01:04:11.110 --> 01:04:12.480 align:middle line:90%
you could see her real wings?

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.355 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Oh
my gosh, she opened up.

01:04:14.355 --> 01:04:15.790 align:middle line:90%
She got so excited.

01:04:15.790 --> 01:04:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And she started telling me
that she could see other things

01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:21.720 align:middle line:90%
that nobody could see.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And she was seeing very dark
kind of things that were scary.

01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And she was seeing people
in the spirit world.

01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And she was seeing the
angelic world and everything

01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:32.580 align:middle line:90%
in between.

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And she said they
follow me everywhere.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.230 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know what to do.

01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:36.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm always being watched.

01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:38.084 align:middle line:90%
And it scares me.

01:04:38.084 --> 01:04:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I was able to explain
to her that this was actually

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:44.920 align:middle line:84%
a very cool ability and that
nobody was there to hurt her.

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:47.110 align:middle line:84%
They were actually
learning from her.

01:04:47.110 --> 01:04:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Because these kids emit this--
they're like a clarion call

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.670 align:middle line:90%
to creation.

01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Yo, humanity just shifted
into something really cool.

01:04:55.830 --> 01:05:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And so these kids
are often observed.

01:05:01.550 --> 01:05:03.002 align:middle line:90%
And nobody will bother them.

01:05:03.002 --> 01:05:04.210 align:middle line:90%
But she could see everything.

01:05:04.210 --> 01:05:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't understand that
they weren't there to hurt her,

01:05:07.930 --> 01:05:10.490 align:middle line:84%
or they weren't going to do
something to somebody else.

01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:11.240 align:middle line:90%
And it scared her.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.490 align:middle line:90%
But she couldn't tell anybody.

01:05:12.490 --> 01:05:13.950 align:middle line:90%
Because it was too freaky.

01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:16.810 align:middle line:84%
She was afraid she'd end up
in a hospital or something.

01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened
for her was amazing.

01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:24.390 align:middle line:84%
When she and I got talking, and
I started explaining everything

01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:29.090 align:middle line:84%
to her, she opened
up so beautifully

01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:32.760 align:middle line:84%
and began to excel in
her life and really made

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.570 align:middle line:90%
some great positive strides.

01:05:34.570 --> 01:05:37.187 align:middle line:84%
And all she needed was
someone to say you're OK.

01:05:37.187 --> 01:05:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I see you.

01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:38.854 align:middle line:90%
And you're OK.

01:05:38.854 --> 01:05:40.311 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
Yeah, I see you.

01:05:40.311 --> 01:05:41.570 align:middle line:90%
I love that out of "Avatar."

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't it
going to be amazing

01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:44.860 align:middle line:84%
when most of the people on
this planet, and ultimately

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:46.670 align:middle line:84%
all of the people
on this planet,

01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:48.899 align:middle line:84%
will have these abilities
to simply see and know?

01:05:48.899 --> 01:05:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
Yeah, and we will.

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:53.516 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No mystery, no
lying, no deceit anymore.

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Exactly.

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:58.090 align:middle line:84%
If we are diligent, that
is entirely possible.

01:05:58.090 --> 01:05:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one
of the things I

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:01.840 align:middle line:84%
was going to-- two other
little points-- not so

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:05.790 align:middle line:84%
little points-- all of these
kids have this sensitivity.

01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:09.730 align:middle line:84%
They're often in fear
because they're so different.

01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
tiny in stature,

01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:15.810 align:middle line:90%
sickly, any number of things.

01:06:15.810 --> 01:06:21.300 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some more severe things
happen after either vaccines,

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:24.260 align:middle line:84%
or they're even born with
particular birth defects.

01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And so they are very
subject to bullying.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Bullying
has become very easy because

01:06:30.310 --> 01:06:35.540 align:middle line:84%
of our technology
and that children

01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and other people-- because
it's not always children--

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:40.550 align:middle line:84%
but what we're seeing
with the children

01:06:40.550 --> 01:06:42.470 align:middle line:84%
is they're doing it
behind technologies,

01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:47.080 align:middle line:84%
their social networks,
texting, these kind of things.

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.100 align:middle line:84%
They're not looking
people in the eye.

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening--
and this is

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.163 align:middle line:84%
why we're seeing so
many child murderers

01:06:53.163 --> 01:06:56.320 align:middle line:84%
as well-- what's happening
is technology's great.

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:56.990 align:middle line:90%
It's convenient.

01:06:56.990 --> 01:07:00.110 align:middle line:84%
It's doing amazing things
for us and our intelligence.

01:07:00.110 --> 01:07:02.230 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
side of that coin,

01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:06.320 align:middle line:84%
it's desensitizing us--
too much at us too fast,

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.680 align:middle line:90%
too many things to keep up with.

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.110 align:middle line:84%
The technology is
constantly changing.

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:13.040 align:middle line:84%
You buy something and
it's already obsolete.

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And we've got so much coming
at us real time, all the time.

01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:16.750 align:middle line:90%
And the media's so dramatic.

01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And they're repeating things
over, and over, and over again.

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
we've got video games

01:07:24.110 --> 01:07:29.700 align:middle line:84%
that are so realistic, so God
awful realistic-- the hero

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:30.220 align:middle line:90%
dies.

01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:32.624 align:middle line:90%
You get another, no brainer.

01:07:32.624 --> 01:07:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And they play these for
hours, and hours, and hours.

01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And then the special
effects are very real.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.191 align:middle line:84%
And the hero gets up
and five minutes later

01:07:38.191 --> 01:07:40.340 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have a scratch,
in the movies or the games

01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:41.800 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.730 align:middle line:90%
It's screwing up the psychology.

01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:45.010 align:middle line:90%
The children are becoming--

01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, kids are
morphing with that reality.

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
They are, yes.

01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:47.630 align:middle line:90%
It's affecting them.

01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing it
in our policeman.

01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Look at how many
shootings and weird things

01:07:52.170 --> 01:07:54.990 align:middle line:84%
have happened
lately-- same reason.

01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:57.640 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what's happening
is our technology

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.790 align:middle line:90%
has outgrown our psychology.

01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:01.800 align:middle line:90%
We need time to catch up.

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.000 align:middle line:90%
It isn't going to happen.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So what we've got to do
is we've got to limit

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.060 align:middle line:90%
what our kids are doing.

01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And sure, give them a
phone to keep them safe.

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:11.760 align:middle line:84%
We want to be able
to reach them.

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.000 align:middle line:90%
We want them to call us.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.220 align:middle line:84%
But we don't want them to
lose that interpersonal

01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.330 align:middle line:90%
relationship.

01:08:17.330 --> 01:08:19.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I'm seeing.

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.479 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm seeing
in the instances of bullying,

01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:24.670 align:middle line:84%
especially when it ends up when
the children commit suicide,

01:08:24.670 --> 01:08:28.100 align:middle line:84%
it was always something
that was posted.

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:30.672 align:middle line:84%
And now they even have sites
where you post something--

01:08:30.672 --> 01:08:32.380 align:middle line:84%
and I don't remember
what they're called,

01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:33.149 align:middle line:90%
or I'd call them.

01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:34.880 align:middle line:90%
I'd name them.

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:37.439 align:middle line:84%
You can put something up and
in a few seconds it's gone.

01:08:37.439 --> 01:08:39.512 align:middle line:84%
So only one person can
see it, or something.

01:08:39.512 --> 01:08:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So you could put
anything on there.

01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And then it disappears,
and stuff like that.

01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And so we really need to get
down to personal relationship

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.229 align:middle line:90%
basics.

01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:51.160 align:middle line:90%
They don't have the connection.

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:54.649 align:middle line:84%
You and I have friends that
will be our friends forever.

01:08:54.649 --> 01:08:57.210 align:middle line:84%
We can call them in 20 years
if we have never spoken.

01:08:57.210 --> 01:09:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And we will-- right
where we left off.

01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:02.859 align:middle line:90%
They're not getting that.

01:09:02.859 --> 01:09:05.500 align:middle line:90%
They're getting disconnected.

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Their awareness is
all over the place.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:08.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:10.582 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they have to
be feeling on their own.

01:09:10.582 --> 01:09:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
And they need to know,

01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:14.970 align:middle line:84%
to be able to know, what
is theirs and what is not,

01:09:14.970 --> 01:09:16.319 align:middle line:90%
how to separate that.

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:20.819 align:middle line:84%
But they need to know the
value of another human being.

01:09:20.819 --> 01:09:22.760 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we're all about.

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:24.410 align:middle line:90%
It's about us.

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and ironically
all of the sensitization

01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:31.460 align:middle line:84%
is happening at the time all
of these hyper sensitive beings

01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:34.552 align:middle line:84%
are being born, the
clash of that happening.

01:09:34.552 --> 01:09:35.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Of course.

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:36.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course, yeah--

01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:37.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
It's a paradox.

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.729 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a paradox.

01:09:38.729 --> 01:09:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And so as we conclude
in the conversation,

01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:45.590 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like it's
very, very important

01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:49.100 align:middle line:84%
for parents to start opening
their own understanding

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:50.794 align:middle line:84%
of their child's
potential, particularly

01:09:50.794 --> 01:09:52.590 align:middle line:90%
if the child's different.

01:09:52.590 --> 01:09:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Start listening, especially
if they have thoughts about I

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:58.975 align:middle line:84%
don't want to be here anymore
or I want to kill myself.

01:09:58.975 --> 01:10:00.100 align:middle line:90%
Any final thoughts on that?

01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:01.724 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
They don't say that.

01:10:01.724 --> 01:10:02.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:05.440 align:middle line:84%
In the book, "The Children
of Now Evolution,"

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.220 align:middle line:84%
there's an entire
chapter on this.

01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of go to
places-- hot lines you can

01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:13.110 align:middle line:90%
call, symptoms to watch for.

01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.930 align:middle line:90%
I did that.

01:10:13.930 --> 01:10:17.130 align:middle line:84%
I specifically listed
a lot of symptoms.

01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:19.615 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with too
many of these families.

01:10:19.615 --> 01:10:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is adults
are struggling to get by.

01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:28.230 align:middle line:90%
The world has changed.

01:10:28.230 --> 01:10:30.080 align:middle line:90%
More is expected of us.

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.880 align:middle line:90%
We are so barely in our bodies.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:36.100 align:middle line:84%
We're so far ahead, trying
to keep up with everything,

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:41.900 align:middle line:84%
that the average parent
spends about 28 minutes a day

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:43.460 align:middle line:90%
with their child.

01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:48.740 align:middle line:84%
So we need to find ways to
adapt, on a personal level,

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:51.000 align:middle line:90%
not the technological level.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.652 align:middle line:90%
We could go one of two ways.

01:10:52.652 --> 01:10:53.360 align:middle line:90%
We have a choice.

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:54.790 align:middle line:90%
And we're there.

01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:56.490 align:middle line:90%
We're at a paradox.

01:10:56.490 --> 01:10:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And so we've got
to get diligent.

01:10:58.350 --> 01:11:01.930 align:middle line:84%
We've got to develop these
interpersonal relations

01:11:01.930 --> 01:11:06.100 align:middle line:84%
and stop being so darn
judgmental of each other.

01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:10.400 align:middle line:84%
A parent can't even correct
their child in public.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.730 align:middle line:84%
They get reported
for child abuse.

01:11:12.730 --> 01:11:14.320 align:middle line:84%
I know places that
it's happened.

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.940 align:middle line:90%
I know people it's happened to.

01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:17.114 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not saying--

01:11:17.114 --> 01:11:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When the kid's totally
screaming out of control.

01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:21.488 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: I'm
not saying toe the line.

01:11:21.488 --> 01:11:23.370 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is
give them structure.

01:11:23.370 --> 01:11:25.090 align:middle line:90%
They feel safe that way.

01:11:25.090 --> 01:11:26.970 align:middle line:90%
Get personal with them.

01:11:26.970 --> 01:11:28.270 align:middle line:90%
And stay that way.

01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And get them to talk
and listen deeply.

01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:33.130 align:middle line:10%
As nine-year-old
Nicholas said, when

01:11:33.130 --> 01:11:34.900 align:middle line:10%
he wrote the forward
to the first book,

01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:35.900 align:middle line:10%
I said what do you need?

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:38.530 align:middle line:10%
He said listen deeply.

01:11:38.530 --> 01:11:41.160 align:middle line:10%
We have come with
great messages.

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.780 align:middle line:90%
And they're still coming.

01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:45.589 align:middle line:84%
And their messages
are remarkable.

01:11:45.589 --> 01:11:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are.

01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted also to just say
you did a beautiful job writing

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:50.290 align:middle line:90%
this book.

01:11:50.290 --> 01:11:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Thank you.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have such
clarity in your writing.

01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:54.867 align:middle line:84%
You're very articulate
and efficient

01:11:54.867 --> 01:11:56.700 align:middle line:84%
in getting through the
themes without losing

any of the warmth.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.160 align:middle line:90%
Very well done book.

01:11:59.160 --> 01:11:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: Thank you.

01:11:59.270 --> 01:12:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I really
appreciate it.

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:01.821 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
I appreciate that.

01:12:01.821 --> 01:12:03.910 align:middle line:84%
It was important to come
across that way for me.

01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
not my normal book.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:12.620 align:middle line:84%
My normal books are
friendlier, more loving, maybe.

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.731 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is more
essential in its nature.

01:12:14.731 --> 01:12:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
This is not a new book.

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:17.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a wake up call.

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it is.

01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:19.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's beautifully done.

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY: And it
needed to be done that way.

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:21.520 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:22.527 align:middle line:90%
That means a lot to me.

01:12:22.527 --> 01:12:24.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And thank you
for joining us here.

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BLACKBURN LOSEY:
Thank you, Regina.

01:12:25.650 --> 01:12:27.691 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, the book
is titled "The Children

01:12:27.691 --> 01:12:28.660 align:middle line:90%
of Now Evolution."

01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
lucid, important guide

01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:32.610 align:middle line:84%
to understanding all
the world's sensitives

01:12:32.610 --> 01:12:34.890 align:middle line:84%
and bringing our societies
up to a level that

01:12:34.890 --> 01:12:36.080 align:middle line:90%
can appreciate them.

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:37.740 align:middle line:90%
Very worthwhile reading.

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:41.540 align:middle line:10%
