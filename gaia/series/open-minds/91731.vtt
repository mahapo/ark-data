00:00:27.714 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: In
my previous conversation

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.620 align:middle line:10%
with Nick Pope, we
were told about events

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.700 align:middle line:10%
that occurred in the
wee hours of Christmas

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.040 align:middle line:10%
in 1980 near a military
installation in England.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.590 align:middle line:84%
These events were well-witnessed
and documented as we discussed.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.500 align:middle line:84%
What's not so well
known are the means

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.540 align:middle line:84%
by which the military go to
see that this information never

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.840 align:middle line:90%
sees the light of day.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Witnesses are
discredited and drugged.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Files go missing.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Dates are deliberately confused
to cloud any paper trail

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.540 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Nick Pope, formally with the
British Ministry of Defense,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.490 align:middle line:84%
tells how these things
work in his book "Encounter

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.362 align:middle line:90%
at Rendlesham Forest."

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:03.070 align:middle line:90%
>>NICK POPE: Yes.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a fascinating story.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.550 align:middle line:10%
And I think part of the
story is the incident itself.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.780 align:middle line:10%
But certainly,
what happened next

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.270 align:middle line:10%
is equally, if not to
some intents and purposes,

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.160 align:middle line:10%
more interesting.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.826 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree,
which is why I wanted

00:01:20.826 --> 00:01:23.230 align:middle line:84%
to do two shows on this because
I didn't want to diminish

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.340 align:middle line:84%
the event and the
profundity of that.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.510 align:middle line:84%
But this is so important
because this is the stumbling

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.160 align:middle line:84%
point when people say, well,
if these things happened,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.580 align:middle line:84%
how come we didn't
hear about it?

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, the military
would have told us.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.340 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.839 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:37.970 align:middle line:84%
The military wouldn't
necessarily tell us.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And you know this because
you were privy to it.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.660 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.930 align:middle line:84%
There are a couple of
points worthy of making

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.510 align:middle line:90%
right at the outset here.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, when we're dealing with
organizations like the United

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.240 align:middle line:84%
States Air Force, the
British Ministry of Defense,

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.700 align:middle line:84%
the DOD here in the US,
we are dealing inherently

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.790 align:middle line:90%
secretive organizations.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Where, really, the default
position is to say nothing.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of people
might be saying, ah,

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.330 align:middle line:84%
but what about the Freedom
of Information Act?

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.640 align:middle line:84%
There are, how shall I
put it, ways around that.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.730 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
couple of things.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, people
have been working

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.070 align:middle line:84%
with the Freedom of Information
Act for many, many years now.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen this at
firsthand that sometimes you'll

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.380 align:middle line:84%
be having a discussion,
and you'll say, oh,

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.590 align:middle line:84%
I think I need to write
to so and so about that.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And then someone will
say, well, yes, you

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.710 align:middle line:84%
could but don't forget, you'll
be creating a paper trail.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you should just pop by the
office and have a little chat.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.490 align:middle line:90%
So there's something like that.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.820 align:middle line:84%
But far more interestingly,
I think-- and this to me

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.590 align:middle line:84%
gets to the heart of
questions like if there's

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.040 align:middle line:84%
a cover up, where
does the secret lie?

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Who is the custodian
of all this?

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.880 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that I've noticed

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.270 align:middle line:84%
happening much more
in recent years

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.880 align:middle line:84%
is the moving of certain very
sensitive and highly classified

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.100 align:middle line:84%
projects out of government
and the military

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.170 align:middle line:90%
and into the private sector.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.020 align:middle line:90%
Now, this has two--

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: There's two
advantages with that.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.564 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, it takes
it outside the scope

00:03:20.564 --> 00:03:21.980 align:middle line:84%
of the Freedom of
Information Act.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:22.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Public domain.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:23.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.313 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Secondly, it makes
congressional scrutiny,

00:03:25.313 --> 00:03:27.890 align:middle line:84%
I think, a little
bit more difficult

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.930 align:middle line:84%
if you're dealing
with the Armed Forces,

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Armed Services Committee,
the Intelligence Committee,

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.970 align:middle line:90%
whatever you're dealing with.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen this happen
on a range of subjects.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.880 align:middle line:84%
But for all the
skeptics that think

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.010 align:middle line:84%
that UFOs is an unclassified
subject of no interest

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.330 align:middle line:84%
to governments, I've seen it
happen to the UFO subject.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.930 align:middle line:84%
A classic example is
a British study code

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.854 align:middle line:84%
named Project Condign,
very similar to Condon.

00:03:57.854 --> 00:03:58.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.010 align:middle line:84%
When I was reading your book,
I though, did he misspell that?

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.240 align:middle line:90%
What about the Condon Report?

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, Project
Condign was commissioned

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.920 align:middle line:84%
by the Ministry of Defense's
super-secret defense

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.440 align:middle line:90%
intelligence staff.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.510 align:middle line:84%
But it was actually undertaken
by a defense company,

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:18.709 align:middle line:90%
a contractor.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And John Burroughs,
in recent years,

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.570 align:middle line:84%
as one of the key witnesses to
the Rendlesham Forest incident,

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.650 align:middle line:84%
has made it his
business to try and go

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.750 align:middle line:84%
after some of these Project
Condign working papers.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And he's found that an awful
lot of them, of course,

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle line:84%
reside in the private sector
and are therefore not eligible.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.970 align:middle line:84%
So he can make all the
FOI requests he like,

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.280 align:middle line:84%
as can any number of
journalists or UFO researchers,

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.287 align:middle line:84%
and they will get
a big fat zero.

00:04:49.287 --> 00:04:49.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And we'll go through,
and we're going

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.130 align:middle line:84%
to kind of do a diagram of how
the information is obscured.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's important to
note for our American viewers

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.550 align:middle line:84%
that the Freedom
of Information Act

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.970 align:middle line:84%
wasn't fully implemented
in England until 2005.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.800 align:middle line:90%
It's relatively new.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Absolutely.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.980 align:middle line:10%
Now, this was Tony Blair's
flagship piece of legislation.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.390 align:middle line:10%
And when he was
elected in 1997, it

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.700 align:middle line:10%
was one of his election
manifesto commitments.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.830 align:middle line:10%
It was enacted in 2000.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.480 align:middle line:84%
But as you quite rightly say,
it was not until January 1, 2005

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.640 align:middle line:84%
that the act came fully into
force across all government

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.420 align:middle line:90%
departments.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:38.070 align:middle line:84%
So many people, such
as myself, when I first

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.340 align:middle line:84%
joined the Ministry
of Defense in 1985,

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.630 align:middle line:84%
the concept of a Freedom
of Information Act

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:84%
was just something that
the Americans have.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.560 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have
to bother with it.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.070 align:middle line:84%
So when I was
writing documents, I

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.980 align:middle line:84%
was writing them
on the assumption

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.100 align:middle line:84%
that they wouldn't
see the light of day

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.200 align:middle line:84%
until long after I was retired
if, indeed, they ever did.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So the Freedom of
Information Act

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.090 align:middle line:84%
was a real culture
change for a lot of us

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.910 align:middle line:84%
in the British
government who had

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.230 align:middle line:90%
been used to dealing without it.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And it took some
getting used to.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.000 align:middle line:84%
But in relation to something
like Rendlesham Forest,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.720 align:middle line:84%
which took place before we got
our Freedom of Information Act,

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.950 align:middle line:84%
it's just added to the fact
that this was effectively

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.300 align:middle line:90%
just buried.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.214 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And even
considering the advantages

00:06:30.214 --> 00:06:31.630 align:middle line:84%
of the Freedom of
Information Act,

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.070 align:middle line:84%
you have such heavily
redacted documents.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.540 align:middle line:90%
You can't read them anyway.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.960 align:middle line:90%
It's very different.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: You have heavily
redacted documents.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.190 align:middle line:84%
You also have dozens
of exclusions covering

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.250 align:middle line:84%
really general categories
in information:

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.950 align:middle line:84%
defense, national security,
intelligence, information

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.350 align:middle line:84%
passed to you in
confidence by an ally.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.820 align:middle line:84%
By the time you finish applying
those sorts of exemptions,

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.270 align:middle line:84%
you end up sometimes
with documents

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.891 align:middle line:84%
that are almost
entirely blacked out.

00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:04.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And so it really ends up
that the most effective way

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.140 align:middle line:84%
to put the story
forward is as you've

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.260 align:middle line:84%
done with this book: direct,
firsthand witnesses who

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.870 align:middle line:90%
are willing to speak.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.640 align:middle line:90%
That's what we wanted to do.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.120 align:middle line:84%
We just wanted to
get the witnesses

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.760 align:middle line:84%
to put their story
into the public domain

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.260 align:middle line:84%
and say to people not
this is what happened,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.871 align:middle line:90%
but this is what we experienced.

00:07:28.871 --> 00:07:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And when I say this is not
what happened, what I mean

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.540 align:middle line:84%
is we are not forcing a
particular interpretation

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.950 align:middle line:90%
down people's throat.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
what we experienced.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.445 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is this
is what we experienced.

00:07:42.445 --> 00:07:45.710 align:middle line:84%
You, the readers, now
make up your own mind.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And if some readers,
after weighing things up,

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.920 align:middle line:84%
are a little more
skeptical and some

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.760 align:middle line:84%
are a little the
other way, then fine.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.927 align:middle line:84%
It would be a very boring
world if everyone agreed.

00:07:55.927 --> 00:07:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.610 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, how did you end up as
a civilian with the Ministry

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.210 align:middle line:84%
of Defense to begin
with, in the long sense?

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And then, that short term
project, the UFO project,

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:07.980 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of that?

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, I
joined the Ministry

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:84%
of Defense pretty much
straight out of college.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And my father had been a very
senior level in the ministry

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:24.600 align:middle line:84%
himself as eventually the Deputy
Chief Scientific Adviser which,

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:84%
despite the title
deputy, was in fact

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.750 align:middle line:90%
the senior internal candidate.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.270 align:middle line:84%
Chief Scientific Adviser was
always a temporary appointment

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.130 align:middle line:84%
from outside,
usually an academic.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.850 align:middle line:84%
So my father was
really the Ministry

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.929 align:middle line:90%
of Defense's chief scientist.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:40.730 align:middle line:90%
And he--

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.938 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you were steeped
with a passion for this

00:08:42.938 --> 00:08:44.309 align:middle line:90%
from an early age I would think?

00:08:44.309 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And he had certainly
suggested that I

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.210 align:middle line:84%
would find a career in
the ministry interesting.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.180 align:middle line:90%
And indeed, I did.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And I did that for 21 years at
a number of different levels.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, every few years,
I was fortunate enough

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.710 align:middle line:90%
to win a promotion.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And I worked with
different areas.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.390 align:middle line:84%
One job I had working
with the Navy.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.960 align:middle line:84%
One working with
the military police.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.780 align:middle line:84%
I got the chance to go to
some very interesting places

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:19.350 align:middle line:84%
like Northern Ireland
and Kosovo and Iraq.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:25.040 align:middle line:84%
The UFO job I did
from 1991 to 1994.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.520 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, it
was just one posting

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.460 align:middle line:84%
amidst a very interesting
21-year career.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And I got that job
almost by chance.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.130 align:middle line:84%
I was working, during
the first Gulf War--

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.860 align:middle line:84%
the Persian Gulf War,
in the Joint Operation

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Center in the Air
Force Operations Room.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been seconded
into there because I

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.430 align:middle line:84%
had a particularly high
security clearance.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And after that, the manager to
whom I was working most closely

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.980 align:middle line:84%
said, I understand that
you're looking for a move.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.280 align:middle line:90%
I have a vacancy.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.340 align:middle line:90%
Do you want the job?

00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.580 align:middle line:90%
I said, what's the job?

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:03.230 align:middle line:90%
And he smiled and said, UFOs.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.380 align:middle line:90%
I said, UFOs?

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.830 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, then.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:07.880 align:middle line:90%
I'll give it a go.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.569 align:middle line:84%
And nothing was ever
quite the same since.

00:10:10.569 --> 00:10:11.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.180 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't think so.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And also just for
the viewers that

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.730 align:middle line:84%
may not have seen the first
part of this conversation,

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle line:84%
you're still under some of
the tenets that security oath.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.339 align:middle line:84%
There's certain specific
things that both US government

00:10:23.339 --> 00:10:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and British government
will not allow

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.140 align:middle line:84%
you to speak about
regarding this incident.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.950 align:middle line:84%
That said, you've shared
a tremendous amount.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:31.450 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:35.160 align:middle line:84%
The constraint I'm under is
the Official Secrets Act.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.920 align:middle line:90%
And that binds me for life.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Having said that, in areas where
the British government has,

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:46.140 align:middle line:84%
itself, declassified
and released material--

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps we can come
on to talk about this.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.720 align:middle line:84%
But something that
happened in recent years

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.520 align:middle line:84%
is the Ministry of
Defense actually released

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.580 align:middle line:84%
most of their
archive of UFO files.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Because they've
done that, I am now

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.280 align:middle line:90%
more free to talk about that.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.990 align:middle line:84%
But yes, there are
very definite limits.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.330 align:middle line:90%
And I won't go beyond them.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a whistleblower.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.690 align:middle line:84%
I don't sit here
as a whistleblower.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:11.480 align:middle line:84%
I sit here as somebody
who was privileged enough

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.390 align:middle line:84%
to sit in an
extraordinary position

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:20.960 align:middle line:84%
and do this extraordinarily
eye-opening and mind-opening,

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.110 align:middle line:90%
paradigm-changing job.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.402 align:middle line:84%
And I am at liberty
to share some of that.

00:11:25.402 --> 00:11:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
your dad was right.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.370 align:middle line:84%
It's been an
interesting career path.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:34.600 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go into some of
the protocols that are used.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.510 align:middle line:84%
We've already gone through, in
part one of this conversation,

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.970 align:middle line:84%
what happened at the
Rendlesham Forest event.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.530 align:middle line:90%
So we have witnesses.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.460 align:middle line:84%
We have two men who were
exposed to radiation.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.140 align:middle line:84%
They have recordings that
were live recordings of what

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.820 align:middle line:90%
was being witnessed at the time.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.490 align:middle line:90%
We have drawings of symbols.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:53.390 align:middle line:84%
We have code,
binary code that was

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:56.770 align:middle line:90%
downloaded into one of them.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And these are the key people
that you have written the book

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.300 align:middle line:90%
with, Burroughs and Penniston.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.370 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's forward the story.

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:84%
The military know
something has happened.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Now it's time to
debrief the witnesses.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how that
begins, and then let's

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.800 align:middle line:84%
talk about where it goes
really in ways that some might

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.550 align:middle line:84%
consider not as ethical
as they could be.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, a
number of the witnesses

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.590 align:middle line:84%
from the first night, and that
includes John Burroughs and Jim

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Penniston, were debriefed
a number of times

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.440 align:middle line:84%
and asked to write
up statements.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's interesting about
this is, right from the outset,

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:46.520 align:middle line:84%
we get things going--
I think off track

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.990 align:middle line:90%
is the phrase that I would use.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.450 align:middle line:84%
So again, as I mentioned
briefly in the first part

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:54.680 align:middle line:84%
of our conversation, but
I'll flesh it out now,

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.360 align:middle line:84%
we had some of these witness
statements being typed up

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.290 align:middle line:90%
and some being handwritten.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:01.730 align:middle line:90%
Some were dated.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Others were not.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Some witnesses,
looking back now,

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.580 align:middle line:84%
say, well, something
was put in front of me,

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.750 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't write it.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.690 align:middle line:90%
And I just signed it.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And some other witnesses have
said, that's not what I signed.

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:23.960 align:middle line:84%
So we have a real mixture
and real confusion.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And in all the conversations
we can have about cover ups

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.220 align:middle line:84%
and conspiracies, one is the
best tactics that you could

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:35.900 align:middle line:84%
ever do is to confuse the
situation, to muddy the waters,

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.050 align:middle line:84%
because what that leads
to is frustration.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And particularly, if any
mainstream journalists, say,

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.520 align:middle line:84%
from The Times or The Post ever
wanted to have a look at this,

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.040 align:middle line:84%
they look into
something like this,

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.890 align:middle line:84%
and they can't really
make head or tails of it.

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They find
holes in the story.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.010 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Exactly.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And that, then, causes them to
call into question the veracity

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.370 align:middle line:84%
of the witnesses themselves
because it's easy to say,

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.700 align:middle line:84%
well you know, this
just doesn't add up.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And in one sense, of course it
doesn't, but that's the point.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.350 align:middle line:90%
That's the point.

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:10.724 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
really simple,

00:14:10.724 --> 00:14:13.490 align:middle line:84%
bureaucratic measures
that allow this to happen.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Very often, I mean,
none of the-- a lot

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:22.730 align:middle line:84%
of the key documents in relation
to the Rendlesham Forest

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:25.149 align:middle line:90%
incident are not hidden.

00:14:25.149 --> 00:14:25.940 align:middle line:90%
They are available.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.090 align:middle line:84%
For example, we
have the document

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:33.110 align:middle line:84%
stating that the radiation
levels at the landing site

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:36.620 align:middle line:84%
were assessed by the Defense
Intelligence staff in the UK

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:84%
as being significantly
higher than background.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.320 align:middle line:90%
We have that document.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.600 align:middle line:90%
We've put in the book.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.610 align:middle line:84%
We have a document stating that
the UFO was tracked on radar.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.390 align:middle line:90%
We have the witness statements.

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:52.210 align:middle line:84%
We have Colonel Halt's report
to the Ministry of Defense.

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:55.410 align:middle line:84%
But there's an old
saying, the best place

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.100 align:middle line:90%
to hide a book is in a library.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.070 align:middle line:84%
So what you do
is, is in a sense,

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.250 align:middle line:84%
you throw many,
many more documents

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.510 align:middle line:90%
into the public domain.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned the
declassification and release

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:13.960 align:middle line:84%
of the MOD's UFO files which
included files and documents

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.390 align:middle line:90%
on Rendlesham Forest.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the real
ones are really buried.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, some
of them have--

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.880 align:middle line:84%
the phrase that the
Ministry of Defense used

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.220 align:middle line:84%
was that some intelligence
files on the Rendlesham Forest

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.580 align:middle line:84%
incident have been, quote,
inadvertently destroyed,

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.840 align:middle line:90%
unquote.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we were told this,
one of the things we said

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.510 align:middle line:84%
was let's have a look at
the destruction slips.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:43.990 align:middle line:84%
I've kind of lived this life, so
I know how the game is played.

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.620 align:middle line:84%
When you destroy
files or documents,

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:50.510 align:middle line:90%
you can't just do it on a whim.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Somebody has to authorize that.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.390 align:middle line:84%
So I said let's have a look
at the destruction slips.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:59.762 align:middle line:84%
That will tell us who
destroyed the files and why.

00:15:59.762 --> 00:16:00.470 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:01.511 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or, indeed, if.

00:16:01.511 --> 00:16:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: If.

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:03.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:08.110 align:middle line:84%
The destruction slips had,
themselves, been destroyed.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:09.020 align:middle line:90%
You really--

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:09.727 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You got to love it.

00:16:09.727 --> 00:16:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: You couldn't
make this up.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And yet, this sort of thing
happens a lot in relation

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.240 align:middle line:84%
to the Rendlesham
Forest incident.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:20.200 align:middle line:84%
One of the interesting
pieces of information we had

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.160 align:middle line:84%
was that some of the local
prisons had been put on alert

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.770 align:middle line:90%
and warned to evacuate.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Why was this?

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:32.070 align:middle line:84%
Did they need a
secure holding area

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:37.300 align:middle line:84%
where people who had maybe
been exposed to something

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.310 align:middle line:84%
could be kept
against their will?

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.300 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some of the
military witnesses.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.330 align:middle line:90%
Maybe even the wider population.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.710 align:middle line:90%
Well, this never happened.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:49.520 align:middle line:84%
But we wanted to get to
the bottom of what alert

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.120 align:middle line:90%
the prisons had been put on.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:84%
We found out that the governor's
journals had gone missing.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:01.950 align:middle line:84%
There was a Navy incident
involving a British warship

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:04.290 align:middle line:90%
called HMS Manchester.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:05.710 align:middle line:90%
We knew there had being a UFO.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.940 align:middle line:84%
We knew it had been
tracked on military radar.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:11.630 align:middle line:84%
We knew that
hundreds of witnesses

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.619 align:middle line:84%
had seen this thing because
it took place during a NATO

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:17.750 align:middle line:84%
exercise involving the
British, the Norwegians,

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.329 align:middle line:90%
number of other nations.

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:22.170 align:middle line:84%
When Lord Hill-Norton, who's
a former Chief of the Defense

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Staff, asked for
the ship's log, he

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.119 align:middle line:84%
was told that it had
been blown overboard

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:30.970 align:middle line:90%
by a freak gust of wind.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:35.450 align:middle line:84%
This sort of thing happens
an awful lot, specifically

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:36.957 align:middle line:90%
with UFO records.

00:17:36.957 --> 00:17:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:38.180 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's talk
about the process

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:41.420 align:middle line:90%
of debriefing witnesses.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:45.240 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to using truth
serum, sodium pentothal, also

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:50.110 align:middle line:84%
using hypnosis, how did
this play in at Rendlesham?

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: What we have
is an allegation

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.930 align:middle line:84%
that a number of
the key witnesses

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.190 align:middle line:90%
were aggressively debriefed.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And this took a number
of different forms.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:04.290 align:middle line:84%
First, just good old-fashioned
shouts and threats,

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:08.240 align:middle line:84%
including the line,
"Bullets are cheap.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:08.760 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.610 align:middle line:90%
They're a dime a dozen.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:14.630 align:middle line:84%
You guys, you better not
go shooting your mouths off

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:15.646 align:middle line:90%
about this."

00:18:15.646 --> 00:18:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Standard threats.

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:18.500 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: But it's further alleged
that some of the key witnesses

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:30.650 align:middle line:84%
were drugged, that they used
sodium pentothal sometimes

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:36.500 align:middle line:84%
perhaps to bring out memories
so that the chain of command

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:41.410 align:middle line:84%
could gain a better
understanding of what exactly

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:43.670 align:middle line:90%
these people had encountered.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:48.680 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes perhaps to
then cloud the situation

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.529 align:middle line:84%
and muddy the waters
and obscure the memories

00:18:53.529 --> 00:18:54.320 align:middle line:90%
of those witnesses.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
what I was wondering.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Because the mind is in a very
open and impressionable state

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.140 align:middle line:90%
at that time, as with hypnosis.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.527 align:middle line:84%
It can as easily be
programmed as accessed.

00:19:03.527 --> 00:19:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes, indeed.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:09.560 align:middle line:90%
So we had this sodium pentothal.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:14.490 align:middle line:84%
But also, we had regression
hypnosis being used.

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And again, that can
be used, of course,

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.980 align:middle line:84%
to bring out hidden
memories, either memories

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:24.810 align:middle line:84%
that have been
suppressed or repressed,

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:28.750 align:middle line:84%
which is either an internal
self-protection mechanism

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:33.570 align:middle line:84%
from the mind itself or an
external process that something

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:38.090 align:middle line:84%
or someone has somehow
suppressed those memories.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And again, you would think,
well, this is highly unusual.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.030 align:middle line:90%
Who might it be?

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:48.200 align:middle line:84%
What agency would have the
power and authority to do that?

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.220 align:middle line:90%
As it happens, there is one.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.030 align:middle line:90%
It's AFOSI.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:56.480 align:middle line:84%
It's Air Force Office of
Special Investigations.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was speaking to someone
at fairly senior rank in the US

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Army.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
my understanding

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:09.500 align:middle line:84%
is that they stopped using drugs
and hypnosis in investigations

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:10.870 align:middle line:90%
years and years ago.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:17.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think it was
after the infamous MKUltra

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.370 align:middle line:84%
situation, and the
Church Committee,

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:26.270 align:middle line:84%
and the CIA using LSD,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:34.260 align:middle line:84%
I found an Air Force Office of
Special Investigations manual

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.900 align:middle line:84%
from the early '90s,
so long after this,

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:43.640 align:middle line:84%
which said any personnel
wishing to use drugs

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.830 align:middle line:84%
or hypnosis in the course
of an investigation

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:51.410 align:middle line:84%
must seek authorization
from higher authority.

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, if there was an
absolute prohibition on this,

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:55.830 align:middle line:90%
it would say so.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: That's not what it said.

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, as late
the early '90s,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.530 align:middle line:84%
AFOSI were, in
some circumstances,

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:06.820 align:middle line:90%
using that technique.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.300 align:middle line:84%
So if they were using
it, could other agencies

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.050 align:middle line:90%
have been using it, too?

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's a brilliant
way to discredit a witness.

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And of course, over the years,
in relation to the Rendlesham

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Forest incident, some witnesses
have changed their stories.

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Some new people have kind
of come out of the woodwork.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And again, people
have said, you know,

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.950 align:middle line:84%
this is just people
jumping on the bandwagon.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:36.910 align:middle line:84%
This is people-- look at how
inconsistent their stories are.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have, in a
totally different job

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.200 align:middle line:84%
in the Ministry of
Defense, my last posting

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.890 align:middle line:84%
was actually in the Directorate
of Defense Security.

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:48.250 align:middle line:84%
I worked very closely
with military police.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.360 align:middle line:84%
One thing they told me is, if
ever you come across a story

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.630 align:middle line:84%
where all the accounts are
almost exactly the same,

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:54.800 align:middle line:90%
beware.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.390 align:middle line:84%
That suggests there's
been collusion

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:59.110 align:middle line:90%
between those witnesses.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Because different people
remember and perceive

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.065 align:middle line:90%
things in different ways.

00:22:04.065 --> 00:22:04.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:05.920 align:middle line:90%
Very good point.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that is done
in a lot of these scenarios

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.580 align:middle line:84%
is the witnesses are
almost immediately--

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.620 align:middle line:84%
they might take a
statement from them.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:16.680 align:middle line:84%
They're immediately dispersed to
far corners and different bases

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.910 align:middle line:84%
so they do not have a chance
to speak to one another.

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: And that's exactly
what happened here.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.620 align:middle line:84%
I was a little
skeptical about that.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And I asked some people who had
been posted there at the time.

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you know, I've
never seen anything like it

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.790 align:middle line:90%
in my Air Force career.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:37.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like normal posting
policy went out of the window.

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.860 align:middle line:84%
It's like people midway
through their tour of duty

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:44.180 align:middle line:84%
or even early into it
were suddenly posted back

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:48.250 align:middle line:84%
to the continental United
States, out to Germany.

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:51.050 align:middle line:84%
It's like the witnesses were
scattered to the four wind.

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this is a
totally different world.

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:58.000 align:middle line:84%
There's no internet or not in
the form that we know it now.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.330 align:middle line:90%
There's no Facebook.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:01.410 align:middle line:90%
There's no cellphones.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:03.370 align:middle line:90%
There's no social networking.

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Once these people were
split up, they didn't really

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.400 align:middle line:84%
find each other again
for years and years.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.280 align:middle line:84%
John Burroughs and
Jim Penniston did not

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:15.410 align:middle line:84%
meet again until
just a few years ago.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is why it's almost as
if somebody, somewhere said,

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.190 align:middle line:84%
you know, let's split
these witnesses up.

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And that way, they'll
only-- they all

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:30.497 align:middle line:90%
have just a piece of the puzzle.

00:23:30.497 --> 00:23:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I think that
might have been even standard

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.850 align:middle line:84%
operating procedure
for that circumstance.

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Because when I
interviewed Robert Salas,

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.060 align:middle line:84%
he said the same
exact thing happened

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:42.850 align:middle line:84%
at the event over the
nuclear silos in Montana

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:45.770 align:middle line:84%
that he was on duty
and witness to.

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And all of the witnesses
around, the guards outside,

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.390 align:middle line:84%
right after that happened,
statements were taken.

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And those people were all
dispersed to different bases

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:54.950 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:55.787 align:middle line:90%
Same story exactly.

00:23:55.787 --> 00:23:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: That's my understanding.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:57.619 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:57.619 --> 00:24:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's easy, then,
for the skeptics or journalists

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:04.310 align:middle line:84%
to say, oh, surely military
people get posted all the time.

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:05.280 align:middle line:90%
And yes, they do.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.371 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:24:06.371 --> 00:24:08.037 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not the day
after an incident.

00:24:08.037 --> 00:24:08.791 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: No.

00:24:08.791 --> 00:24:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And not such a large
number of them.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:13.020 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is why I--

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beyond coincidence.

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:14.316 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Exactly.

00:24:14.316 --> 00:24:15.860 align:middle line:84%
This is why I
asked the question.

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.800 align:middle line:84%
I said, look, I know people
get posted all the time.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.580 align:middle line:84%
But was this the
standard posting policy,

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.080 align:middle line:90%
or was this something else?

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.497 align:middle line:84%
And universally,
people came back

00:24:25.497 --> 00:24:27.080 align:middle line:84%
and said, no, this
was something else.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Something else.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Another technique that's used
is to put incorrect dates

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:37.290 align:middle line:84%
on witness reports and files
and so forth in the event

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:41.300 align:middle line:84%
that people do go on
an investigative path

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:42.820 align:middle line:90%
and try to uncover information.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:46.240 align:middle line:84%
If the witnesses all saying
it happen on a certain date,

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.640 align:middle line:84%
but the file is basically
labeled from the day after

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.860 align:middle line:84%
or the day before, it
ends up a dead end trail.

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:53.690 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Even Colonel Halt's
initial report

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:00.310 align:middle line:84%
to the British
Ministry of Defense

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:03.140 align:middle line:90%
had the wrong dates in it.

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, was this
just a clerical error,

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:10.060 align:middle line:84%
or was it something
more sinister?

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.670 align:middle line:84%
It certainly did
have the advantage

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:17.250 align:middle line:84%
that it stymied
the investigation.

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:21.180 align:middle line:84%
It certainly thwarted
the efforts-- word

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.710 align:middle line:90%
of this soon leaked out.

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:27.090 align:middle line:84%
People inevitably were-- these
people lived, some of them,

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:29.450 align:middle line:90%
off base in the local community.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Word pretty quickly got out into
the local bars and restaurants

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.710 align:middle line:90%
that something had happened.

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And even in these days before
the internet and things,

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:44.610 align:middle line:84%
there were UFO and
paranormal investigators

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:46.820 align:middle line:84%
who heard that something
had gone down here.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:50.280 align:middle line:84%
But because they had the wrong
dates, when people started,

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.850 align:middle line:84%
in America, groups like
Citizens Against UFO Secrecy,

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:57.424 align:middle line:84%
when they started using the
Freedom of Information Act,

00:25:57.424 --> 00:25:59.090 align:middle line:84%
everyone was looking
at the wrong dates.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:25:59.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:03.890 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Even-- and this is
where it gets controversial.

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:07.130 align:middle line:90%
And you mentioned this earlier.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.190 align:middle line:84%
The relationship between the
British and American government

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:12.800 align:middle line:84%
themselves, don't
forget, it wasn't just

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.810 align:middle line:84%
journalists and UFO
researchers that ended up

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:18.530 align:middle line:84%
with the wrong dates, it
was the British government.

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And when we, for example,
checked our Royal Air Force

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:29.390 align:middle line:84%
radar tapes back in 1980 as
part of the MOD investigation,

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:31.700 align:middle line:84%
we were checking
the wrong dates.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.390 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:36.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did that
tick them off?

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It did.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:44.050 align:middle line:84%
But something else that happened
annoyed the British even more.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What was that?

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, this led almost
to a diplomatic incident.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
most intriguing parts

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:54.530 align:middle line:90%
of the whole story.

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Shortly after, and I'm talking
days after the Rendlesham

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Forest incident, General
Gabriel flew in from Germany,

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:10.110 align:middle line:84%
was briefed on
what had happened,

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:14.740 align:middle line:84%
and flew back, taking with
him various items relating

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:18.460 align:middle line:84%
to the case, including the
original tape recording

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.010 align:middle line:90%
that Colonel Halt made.

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.730 align:middle line:84%
But maybe some of the
other physical evidence.

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:25.060 align:middle line:90%
Soil samples were taken.

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Sap samples were taken from the
trees that had been irradiated.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is interesting
for a couple of reasons.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Firstly-- and this is a
very fundamental point.

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Bear in mind, this is 1980.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.100 align:middle line:84%
The official position of
the United States government

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.090 align:middle line:84%
is, hey, we don't
investigate UFOs anymore.

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:52.150 align:middle line:84%
We terminated our
investigative program in 1969.

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:55.480 align:middle line:84%
If that's true, why
is General Gabriel

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.340 align:middle line:84%
flying in to be briefed
on this incident

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.820 align:middle line:84%
and taking items back
to his headquarters?

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And for any viewers
who are wondering

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:06.490 align:middle line:84%
who General Gabriel
was, he was Commander

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:09.480 align:middle line:84%
in Chief, United States
Air Force in Europe.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So here we have the US
government saying, on the one

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:15.310 align:middle line:84%
hand, we don't
investigate UFOs anymore.

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:19.870 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, the senior
ranking US Air Force officer

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:23.340 align:middle line:84%
in Europe flies in and
is briefed on this.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.590 align:middle line:90%
Something doesn't quite add up.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:29.900 align:middle line:84%
But here's where it caused
the row with the Brits.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.570 align:middle line:90%
There was a document.

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the Ministry
of Defense file.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:39.845 align:middle line:84%
We reproduced it in the
appendix to "Encounter

00:28:39.845 --> 00:28:41.370 align:middle line:90%
in Rendlesham Forest."

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And it says General
Gabriel visited,

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.250 align:middle line:90%
took possession of this.

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can imagine how
incandescent with fury

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:55.429 align:middle line:84%
the Ministry of Defense were to
learn that not only had items

00:28:55.429 --> 00:28:57.220 align:middle line:84%
pertaining to an incident
that had occurred

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:00.960 align:middle line:84%
on British soil been
removed from the country,

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.950 align:middle line:84%
but that we hadn't
even been informed.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.750 align:middle line:90%
We found out retrospectively.

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you read
that document, it

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:13.580 align:middle line:84%
uses marvelously diplomatic
British understatement.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.430 align:middle line:84%
But it says, perhaps it
would be reasonable to ask

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:19.190 align:middle line:84%
if we could have a
look at this, too.

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:21.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I can't--

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's embarrassingly
dismissive of the US military

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.520 align:middle line:84%
and government to do this,
not just on British soil

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.971 align:middle line:90%
but in general.

00:29:30.971 --> 00:29:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:32.330 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And I, of course, had not
joined the Ministry of Defense

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.410 align:middle line:90%
by that time.

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:40.000 align:middle line:90%
I joined in '85.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.460 align:middle line:84%
So while I launched a cold case
review of Rendlesham in 1994,

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:50.500 align:middle line:84%
I was, of course, not handling
the investigation back in 1980.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:55.430 align:middle line:84%
But if I had have been, I would
have almost certainly briefed

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:58.280 align:middle line:84%
our Secretary of
State for Defense

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:01.600 align:middle line:84%
to raise this at the
highest level with his US

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.380 align:middle line:90%
opposite number.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.940 align:middle line:84%
I would've said this is
absolutely unconscionable.

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, going on to
obscuration here,

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.110 align:middle line:84%
we have US Air Force also
lied about the radar readings

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:17.530 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the radiation.

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:18.930 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:19.740 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.720 align:middle line:84%
I want to be careful
about using the word lie.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.105 align:middle line:84%
There was an inconsistency
in the readings.

00:30:27.105 --> 00:30:27.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes, of course.

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: There was a disconnect.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:29.631 align:middle line:90%
A disconnect.

00:30:29.631 --> 00:30:32.420 align:middle line:90%


00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:37.402 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: They were economical
with the actuality.

00:30:37.402 --> 00:30:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How British
to say it that way.

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is a big deal
because Burroughs and Penniston

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:50.170 align:middle line:84%
were both affected
by the radiation.

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:52.980 align:middle line:84%
They were both in close
proximity to the radiation

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.520 align:middle line:84%
from the craft,
touching the craft.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:54.935 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:30:54.935 --> 00:30:56.935 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so they
obscured this information.

00:30:56.935 --> 00:30:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, they were
economical with the facts.

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.730 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Jim touched the
side of this thing.

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, there was
a flash of light.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:09.790 align:middle line:84%
The declassified
project Condign--

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:13.410 align:middle line:84%
and when I say declassified,
the original level of this

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.580 align:middle line:90%
was secret, UK eyes only.

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:18.800 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about fairly
high level, just one down

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.930 align:middle line:90%
from top secret.

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:26.160 align:middle line:84%
It basically came out and said
these guys with irradiated.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the US government
public position on this

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.120 align:middle line:90%
is, well, nothing happened.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Or if something happened,
it was just lights.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.084 align:middle line:84%
And it was of no
defense interest.

00:31:39.084 --> 00:31:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They downplayed
it even though there

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.481 align:middle line:84%
were health issues
at stake here.

00:31:42.481 --> 00:31:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:44.000 align:middle line:90%
And they still are.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.430 align:middle line:84%
John and Jim still
struggle to access

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:50.140 align:middle line:90%
their military medical records.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:54.090 align:middle line:84%
John, I know, is actively
talking to his senator.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:56.160 align:middle line:90%
Senator Kyl has been involved.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Senator McCain
has been involved.

00:31:57.930 --> 00:31:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Trying to
get their own files.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:31:59.921 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Absolutely.

00:31:59.921 --> 00:32:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that they are lodged

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:05.270 align:middle line:84%
in the little-known
classified record

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:09.040 align:middle line:84%
section of the Department for
Veterans Affairs, the sort

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:13.220 align:middle line:84%
of place where Special Forces
soldiers' records usually

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:13.780 align:middle line:90%
end up.

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, John and Jim
weren't Special Forces.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:20.520 align:middle line:84%
So what is it about their
medical records that

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.330 align:middle line:84%
means that they
can't be released?

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And now, last year, Steve
Bassett organized something

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.340 align:middle line:84%
called the Citizens
Hearing on Disclosure.

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.794 align:middle line:84%
John and Jim were two
of the key witnesses.

00:32:32.794 --> 00:32:33.460 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:37.000 align:middle line:10%
>>SPEAKER: Those who debunk
the whole UFO thing, what

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.720 align:middle line:10%
do they do with this incident?

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.690 align:middle line:10%
How do they explain it away?

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:42.370 align:middle line:10%
It was real.

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:43.105 align:middle line:10%
You saw it.

00:32:43.105 --> 00:32:45.780 align:middle line:10%
It was tracked on radar.

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.902 align:middle line:10%
How do they explain it away?

00:32:47.902 --> 00:32:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN BURROUGHS: We
believe the cover up

00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:52.660 align:middle line:84%
started within 24 hours
after the incident.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:56.090 align:middle line:84%
There was an individual sent
downtown and made contact

00:32:56.090 --> 00:33:00.120 align:middle line:84%
with some local, what they call,
reporters and investigators

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.320 align:middle line:90%
that were involved in UFOs.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was spread
around that there

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:07.890 align:middle line:84%
was some kind of alien
contact in the forest.

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Also what went on after that
was there was a debunker that

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:13.720 align:middle line:84%
came forward and tried
to explain it away

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.730 align:middle line:84%
as either Colonel Halt, who
was a combat controller prior

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:21.410 align:middle line:84%
to becoming a command officer,
that he was either fooled

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:24.430 align:middle line:84%
by stars, planets, or
the local lighthouse.

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:26.150 align:middle line:90%
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: And the former
congressional representatives,

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.120 align:middle line:84%
Republican, Democrat,
Libertarian,

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:37.810 align:middle line:84%
who were sitting down on the
panel and asking the questions,

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:43.570 align:middle line:84%
taking the testimony,
were so outraged by this

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:47.380 align:middle line:84%
that they wrote a letter to the
President of the United States

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:50.960 align:middle line:84%
and to the Secretary
of the Veterans Agency

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:54.590 align:middle line:84%
asking that John and
Jim be given access

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:56.160 align:middle line:84%
to their medical
records so that they

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.789 align:middle line:84%
could get a proper diagnosis
and proper treatment.

00:33:59.789 --> 00:34:02.455 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Probably the most well
known whistleblower in the case

00:34:02.455 --> 00:34:03.490 align:middle line:90%
is Larry Warren.

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was first exposed to his
testimony at the disclosure--

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:11.540 align:middle line:84%
original disclosure by
Steven Greer in Washington,

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.250 align:middle line:90%
DC back in 2001.

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's just take a
moment to hear what

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:19.954 align:middle line:84%
Larry had to say about his
experience at Rendlesham.

00:34:19.954 --> 00:34:20.620 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LARRY WARREN: It was
so beyond anything.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's right in front of us.

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:27.719 align:middle line:10%
I was at least 30 feet
away from it at one point.

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:28.880 align:middle line:90%
Too close.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.250 align:middle line:84%
There was a life form
in association with it.

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:35.692 align:middle line:10%
And so I can just cut to the
chase, which we perceived--

00:34:35.692 --> 00:34:37.150 align:middle line:10%
I perceived-- I
remember thinking--

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:40.150 align:middle line:10%
and you've heard other
witnesses say this.

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:41.422 align:middle line:10%
There's children.

00:34:41.422 --> 00:34:42.880 align:middle line:84%
What are these
children doing here?

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.803 align:middle line:90%
And the mind starts scrambling.

00:34:44.803 --> 00:34:46.719 align:middle line:84%
But they were almost--
there was in the light.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:48.677 align:middle line:84%
There was bright light,
and there was movement.

00:34:48.677 --> 00:34:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And these things
had an upper body.

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.060 align:middle line:84%
I clearly saw with--
and when I saw

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.040 align:middle line:84%
an arm, what I perceived
to be arms, move,

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:58.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm like-- you're in
another place at that point.

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:01.910 align:middle line:84%
What I saw was on the
left-- the right side,

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:06.120 align:middle line:84%
delta of this bizarre
object, machine.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.750 align:middle line:90%
This bright light moved out.

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:09.690 align:middle line:90%
It was bluish gold.

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:11.310 align:middle line:84%
It was about a foot
off the ground.

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:14.120 align:middle line:84%
It split, and it was only
about four feet in height

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:14.940 align:middle line:90%
from the ground up.

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:16.630 align:middle line:90%
But it split away.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And three individual kind
of oblong cocoons of light

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.310 align:middle line:90%
with this thing in it.

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:30.370 align:middle line:90%
Three individual things inside.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:33.010 align:middle line:10%
I have a conscious memory,
whether it's real or not,

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:36.230 align:middle line:10%
of looking into a very dark
void and having someone

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:39.600 align:middle line:10%
to the side of me explaining
that there were tunnels

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.880 align:middle line:10%
that connect the bases.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.600 align:middle line:10%
There were tunnels from
the bases to the North Sea.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.520 align:middle line:10%
These tunnels, that
were lit tunnels,

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.610 align:middle line:10%
and I can still see them
in my mind, were massive.

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:49.790 align:middle line:10%
And they entered.

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:52.280 align:middle line:10%
They let out into the Orford
quay of the North Sea.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:52.680 align:middle line:90%
[END OF VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.804 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Well, I like Larry.

00:35:53.804 --> 00:35:57.520 align:middle line:84%
He's certainly the archetypal
colorful character.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.280 align:middle line:84%
I sat down and had
a beer with the guy.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:03.650 align:middle line:10%
His story is
difficult to reconcile

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:08.570 align:middle line:10%
with what you hear from
John Burroughs, Jim

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:12.260 align:middle line:10%
Penniston, Charles
Halt, Monroe Nevels.

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And his talk of underground
cities and the commanding

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:23.140 align:middle line:84%
officer maybe meeting,
even shaking hands

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.750 align:middle line:90%
with some sort of entity.

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:28.630 align:middle line:84%
Again, the problem is that
none of the other witnesses

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:30.050 align:middle line:90%
saw that.

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:32.790 align:middle line:84%
I got into trouble
with some people

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:36.770 align:middle line:84%
in the UFO community for
this because Larry Warren

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:39.511 align:middle line:84%
gets about three
pages in our book.

00:36:39.511 --> 00:36:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And someone said,
well, why is that.

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.610 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, because our book
is not about Larry Warren.

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And I said, with the
best will in the world,

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:50.310 align:middle line:84%
John and Jim did not
see Larry out there.

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And I can't kind of make
them kind of have seen them.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:58.780 align:middle line:90%
They didn't see him.

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:02.810 align:middle line:10%
So we-- in effect,
the book is the story

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:06.720 align:middle line:10%
of Rendlesham seen through
the eyes of the two witnesses

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.590 align:middle line:10%
at the heart of this, John
Burroughs and Jim Penniston.

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:13.870 align:middle line:10%
And if they didn't see Larry out
there, nothing can change that.

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:18.230 align:middle line:10%
So-- but where I think
Larry is important is he,

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:21.520 align:middle line:10%
without question,
was the first or one

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:25.050 align:middle line:10%
of the first whistleblowers
to this case.

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:26.720 align:middle line:90%
He got the story out.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether the
story that he tells

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:35.030 align:middle line:84%
is something that
can be reconciled

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:37.950 align:middle line:84%
with the other witnesses,
well, I think, as I've said,

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:39.220 align:middle line:90%
that's very difficult.

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:44.020 align:middle line:84%
But he, undoubtedly, is owed
a huge debt of gratitude

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:48.100 align:middle line:84%
by everyone for really
being essential to getting

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.105 align:middle line:90%
the story out.

00:37:49.105 --> 00:37:52.420 align:middle line:84%
But like I say, what
he claims, that's

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:53.950 align:middle line:90%
not what John and Jim saw.

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's not what
Colonel Halt saw.

00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's not what most of the
witnesses that I've interviewed

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:02.250 align:middle line:90%
have seen or experienced.

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So with all of this
taken into consideration, how

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:10.017 align:middle line:84%
do the governing agencies go
about releasing now-- now,

00:38:10.017 --> 00:38:11.600 align:middle line:84%
we've been talking
about the cover-up.

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:16.030 align:middle line:84%
How do they go about releasing
information to the conspiracy

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:18.370 align:middle line:84%
communities because this
is another conspiracy

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:20.455 align:middle line:90%
within a conspiracy really.

00:38:20.455 --> 00:38:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, the
British government

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:27.130 align:middle line:84%
has fairly recently completed,
for the most part, what

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:31.430 align:middle line:84%
was a five-year program
to declassify and release

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:36.490 align:middle line:84%
its entire archive of UFO
files, many of which I wrote.

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's funny
about this, I think,

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:42.110 align:middle line:84%
is-- bear in mind
something I think

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:44.390 align:middle line:84%
I said in our
first conversation,

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:49.070 align:middle line:84%
in our first interview, that
the British government always

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:53.790 align:middle line:84%
told the UK's Parliament,
the media, and the public,

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:57.750 align:middle line:84%
oh, they said, this is a subject
on which we've got very little

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:58.460 align:middle line:90%
interest.

00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And we glance at
these reports to see

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.240 align:middle line:84%
if they're of any
defense interest.

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.820 align:middle line:84%
But we really don't put
much resources into this.

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And the whole phenomenon is
of no defense significance.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:13.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:19.530 align:middle line:84%
When they released these files,
there were 55,000 documents.

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's an awful lot for
a subject on which, quote,

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:26.640 align:middle line:90%
they have very little interest.

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How is-- I
know there are also

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:32.880 align:middle line:84%
special ways of infiltrating
into conspiracy communities

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.550 align:middle line:84%
to put kind of
wacky disinformation

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:39.480 align:middle line:84%
into their stream of
information to further discredit

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.130 align:middle line:90%
the subject.

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:41.614 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:39:41.614 --> 00:39:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well,
sometimes, it can be

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:47.180 align:middle line:84%
as simple as using phrases
like little green men.

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And very often, you'll
have, for example,

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:55.650 align:middle line:84%
if a journalist tries to
do a serious piece on UFOs,

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:58.210 align:middle line:84%
the contact will go
through the press office.

00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And the press officer
will slip in a phrase

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:04.360 align:middle line:84%
like little green men or
the rather archaic term,

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.030 align:middle line:90%
now, flying saucers.

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And the whole story
will doubtless

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.455 align:middle line:90%
come out looking and sounding--

00:40:10.455 --> 00:40:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With a
different slant.

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yeah.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:15.190 align:middle line:84%
It will look and sound
a little bit silly.

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And will refer to
people as-- now, I

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:20.880 align:middle line:84%
don't know whether
this phrase translates

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:25.370 align:middle line:84%
from British to American
English, but UFO spotters.

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:29.100 align:middle line:84%
But it's a phrase that
sounds very nerd-ish.

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is a tactic
that I think clearly

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:37.050 align:middle line:84%
does go some way to
discredit the subject

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:39.230 align:middle line:90%
and make it look ridiculous.

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:42.210 align:middle line:84%
But you know, the
other tactic is simply

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:46.740 align:middle line:84%
this best place to hide
a book is in a library.

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And when the files
were released--

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:51.930 align:middle line:84%
and I found myself, as the
public face of this, being

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:53.860 align:middle line:84%
interviewed on the
BBC, being interviewed

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:57.520 align:middle line:84%
all around the world about
this, but inevitably,

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.580 align:middle line:84%
what happens with
55,000 documents

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:05.520 align:middle line:84%
is that there are some
fascinating stories of UFOs

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:09.220 align:middle line:84%
being seen by pilots and
by police officers, UFOs

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:10.780 align:middle line:90%
being tracked on radar.

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.910 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, what
inevitably happens

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:17.080 align:middle line:84%
is the story of
the guy coming back

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:21.735 align:middle line:84%
from the bar late at night kind
of finds its way to the front

00:41:21.735 --> 00:41:22.260 align:middle line:90%
somehow.

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:24.593 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now, that's
what I was going to ask you.

00:41:24.593 --> 00:41:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Is this the way in which
intelligence communities

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.330 align:middle line:90%
might use tabloids?

00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:30.880 align:middle line:90%


00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:31.840 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: It might.

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.260 align:middle line:84%
This is an area
where I, again, I

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:38.690 align:middle line:84%
can't discuss
intelligence operations.

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's been rumored
that they do plant stories

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.460 align:middle line:84%
in tabloids to
discredit subjects.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I've certainly--
I'm aware of those rumors.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.717 align:middle line:84%
This is an area that I
can't really discuss.

00:41:49.717 --> 00:41:52.050 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, again, for people
that want to research it,

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:54.440 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
material out there.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:42:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, there are people,
such as the former MI5 officer

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Annie Machon, who will testify
about the sorts of techniques

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:11.190 align:middle line:84%
that the intelligence agencies,
certainly in the UK, will use.

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:13.100 align:middle line:84%
But I'd better not
comment on that.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:14.933 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'd love to
interview her one day.

00:42:14.933 --> 00:42:16.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to see
if I can do that.

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Are any of the witnesses,
then, actually plants,

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.320 align:middle line:84%
where they're not actual
witnesses but plants,

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.850 align:middle line:84%
so to speak to kind of, again,
further obscure the story

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:28.070 align:middle line:90%
or take it down another path?

00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: I don't know
that for a fact,

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:32.340 align:middle line:84%
and I'd better not
speculate too much.

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:34.970 align:middle line:84%
But one can't help
but wonder with some

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:37.490 align:middle line:84%
of these characters
whether they just

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:41.000 align:middle line:84%
haven't been given a
job of putting so much

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.960 align:middle line:84%
ridiculous information out there
that actually it has the end

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:49.700 align:middle line:84%
result of turning any
serious mainstream

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.550 align:middle line:90%
journalist off this subject.

00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:55.260 align:middle line:84%
We would like, in
an ideal world,

00:42:55.260 --> 00:43:00.680 align:middle line:84%
to see a Woodward or a Bernstein
look at the UFO issue and look

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:05.300 align:middle line:84%
at something like Rendlesham,
but when you get all this talk

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:10.120 align:middle line:84%
of underground cities and people
shaking hands with aliens,

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:13.350 align:middle line:90%
you can see why they don't.

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's challenging
to retain one's credibility

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:19.190 align:middle line:84%
and still become associated
with those stories.

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.980 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.580 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Indeed.

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Again, we can speculate about
the extent to which this

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:28.940 align:middle line:84%
is deliberate or just an
unintended but fortunate

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:29.680 align:middle line:90%
consequence.

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:33.560 align:middle line:84%
But just look, for example,
at Dennis Kucinich's

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.790 align:middle line:84%
presidential campaign
and how that just

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:38.950 align:middle line:84%
crashed and burned
after the media

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:41.510 align:middle line:84%
got hold of the story
of the UFO sighting

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:43.055 align:middle line:90%
at Shirley MacLaine's house.

00:43:43.055 --> 00:43:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: So this
subject is toxic as far

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:50.880 align:middle line:90%
as credibility is concerned.

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And there are very few
politicians who will grasp it.

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And when they do,
they're generally

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.440 align:middle line:84%
very careful to speak
about it in terms

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.960 align:middle line:84%
of it being an open government,
freedom of information issue

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.720 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to a I
think there might

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:07.587 align:middle line:90%
be something to this issue.

00:44:07.587 --> 00:44:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And another phenomena that
you talked about in the book

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:14.880 align:middle line:84%
is, OK, there are
pieces of information,

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:19.600 align:middle line:84%
for example, even though they
have made a-- made it a purpose

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:24.070 align:middle line:84%
to deny these events, then
they have other reports where

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:27.660 align:middle line:84%
the military will
expressly state to pilots,

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:31.440 align:middle line:84%
do not try to outmaneuver
these vehicles.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Again, obviously
referring to vehicles

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:36.611 align:middle line:84%
that we have no
capability to match.

00:44:36.611 --> 00:44:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:39.925 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're quoting directly
from the final report

00:44:39.925 --> 00:44:41.950 align:middle line:90%
of Project Condign there.

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:43.110 align:middle line:90%
And it is marvelous.

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:44.890 align:middle line:90%
It's an incredible document.

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:47.922 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you'll
have seen, I'm sure,

00:44:47.922 --> 00:44:49.380 align:middle line:84%
that one of the
things that it does

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:54.000 align:middle line:84%
is it doesn't use the phrase
UFO-- or not very often.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.990 align:middle line:84%
This is something
we did deliberately.

00:44:55.990 --> 00:45:01.520 align:middle line:84%
We swapped the terms, and
we coined the phrase UAP,

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.190 align:middle line:90%
unidentified aerial phenomena.

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: So we came up with
these phrases, as you say,

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:10.890 align:middle line:84%
like no attempt should
be made to outmaneuver

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:15.980 align:middle line:84%
a UAP during interception other
than to try to place the object

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:17.890 align:middle line:90%
astern, if possible.

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:20.610 align:middle line:84%
But one of the other
things in Project Condign

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:22.710 align:middle line:84%
is it talks-- and
perhaps this gets

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:26.400 align:middle line:84%
to the heart of UFO
or UAP, should I say,

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:32.550 align:middle line:84%
secrecy is in one of the
rather obscure parts of it--

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:34.600 align:middle line:90%
but again, it's out there.

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.920 align:middle line:90%
You can find this quote.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:42.750 align:middle line:84%
It talks about the potential
applications of this.

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And it uses the phrase "novel
military applications."

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:50.640 align:middle line:84%
It goes on, specifically,
to talk about weaponization

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.740 align:middle line:90%
and directed energy weapons.

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
technology acquisition that

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:01.720 align:middle line:84%
gets to the heart of UFO
secrecy, both in relation

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:04.390 align:middle line:84%
to Rendlesham Forest and,
arguably, in relation

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:06.090 align:middle line:84%
to the phenomenon
more generally.

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to ask
yourself, if any of this

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:12.720 align:middle line:84%
turns out to be true--
and we had a phrase.

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:15.130 align:middle line:84%
The believers only
have to be right once,

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and it's the ultimate
game changer.

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So if any of this
turns out to be true,

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:25.990 align:middle line:84%
the nation or maybe
corporation that first acquires

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:29.200 align:middle line:84%
this technology and
figures out how to use it

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:33.160 align:middle line:84%
will be the preeminent
power on the face

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:37.740 align:middle line:84%
of this planet
militarily, economically,

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:40.560 align:middle line:84%
politically for the
foreseeable future.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.990 align:middle line:90%
High stakes I would argue.

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And sufficiently high stakes
that you could understand

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:52.180 align:middle line:84%
why even tried and
tested alliances

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:55.300 align:middle line:84%
like the special relationship
between the US and the UK

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:58.650 align:middle line:84%
seem to go out of the window
when we come to this subject.

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:00.977 align:middle line:84%
It's like, it's everyone
for themselves on this one.

00:47:00.977 --> 00:47:01.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the big
game changer at least

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:06.450 align:middle line:84%
in that sense of how
the world operates.

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Is that perhaps why the
Ministry of Defense,

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.830 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, even started
bringing psychics

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:16.260 align:middle line:90%
in to read the situation?

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Well, that was
a different program.

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, the Ministry of
Defense's remote viewing

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:27.830 align:middle line:84%
project, or rather a study to
see whether we should set up

00:47:27.830 --> 00:47:32.840 align:middle line:84%
a project, was actually ordered
very shortly after 9/11.

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:35.940 align:middle line:84%
So again, one can have a
debate about whether it

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:37.620 align:middle line:90%
was a direct result of that.

00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:41.530 align:middle line:84%
But again, this study
reports-- interestingly,

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:43.140 align:middle line:84%
it's another example
of a study that

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:45.770 align:middle line:84%
was commissioned by the
Defense Intelligence Staff

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:51.060 align:middle line:84%
but undertaken by a
defense corporation

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:53.850 align:middle line:84%
to have the effect
of taking a lot of it

00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:55.670 align:middle line:90%
outside of the scope of FOI.

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very similar to SRI,
Stanford Research Institute,

00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:00.030 align:middle line:90%
British version of that.

00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Absolutely.

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was very peripherally
involved in some discussions

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.410 align:middle line:90%
about this back in the '90s.

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:09.490 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't involved in
this particular study.

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:16.294 align:middle line:84%
But I'm aware of it and
know a little bit about it.

00:48:16.294 --> 00:48:17.960 align:middle line:84%
I think it was a
classic example of what

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:21.140 align:middle line:84%
we would call low
probability, high impact.

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:24.820 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
maybe it won't work.

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:27.490 align:middle line:84%
But if it does, the
consequences are

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:30.990 align:middle line:84%
so immense that we need
to be in this game,

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:33.480 align:middle line:84%
particularly if we think that
the Russians or others might

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:33.980 align:middle line:90%
be.

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:35.267 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or Americans are.

00:48:35.267 --> 00:48:35.850 align:middle line:90%
And they were.

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Or Americans.

00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:37.635 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And they both were.

00:48:37.635 --> 00:48:38.135 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:38.135 --> 00:48:40.600 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: And the paper
trail absolutely backs up

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:42.361 align:middle line:84%
the fact, as you
say, that they were.

00:48:42.361 --> 00:48:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now,
something interesting

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:44.820 align:middle line:90%
is going to be happening.

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:46.195 align:middle line:84%
It will have
happened by the time

00:48:46.195 --> 00:48:49.010 align:middle line:84%
that this airs because
it's coming up very soon.

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And this is a NASA event
with the Library of Congress

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:56.290 align:middle line:84%
having to do with the
investigation of this issue.

00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:58.670 align:middle line:84%
In England, the Royal
Society has already

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:00.300 align:middle line:90%
had two such meetings.

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us about the
nature of each of these?

00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And also might this actually be
the time where the military is

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:11.450 align:middle line:84%
willing to finally start
trickling the information out

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:12.740 align:middle line:90%
to the public at large?

00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's been saying,
when is disclosure happening?

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:17.650 align:middle line:90%
Well, it appears, it is.

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:23.360 align:middle line:84%
The Royal Society held two
discussion meetings in 2010

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.230 align:middle line:90%
in the UK.

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:27.840 align:middle line:90%
And I was at both of them.

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:32.660 align:middle line:84%
The first one was called The
Detection of Extraterrestrial

00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Life and the Consequences
for Science and Society.

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:40.350 align:middle line:84%
The second one had an even
more provocative title.

00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:46.860 align:middle line:84%
It was Towards a Societal
Agenda on Extraterrestrial Life.

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:54.050 align:middle line:84%
The NASA/Library of Congress
event, September 2014,

00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:57.550 align:middle line:84%
has the title Preparing
for Discovery.

00:49:57.550 --> 00:49:59.880 align:middle line:84%
All of these meetings
are essentially

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:04.890 align:middle line:84%
multi-disciplinary gatherings
where-- basically it's

00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:08.980 align:middle line:84%
science community more than
government or military.

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:12.740 align:middle line:84%
But it's scientists
coming together and saying

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:17.330 align:middle line:84%
not just how is the search
for extraterrestrial life

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:21.780 align:middle line:84%
going, but more to the point,
what happens when we find it.

00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's very much
dressed up and billed

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:28.930 align:middle line:90%
as astrobiology, of course.

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And people will talk about
microbial life on Mars

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:36.910 align:middle line:84%
or Europa, or perhaps the SETI
program, radio astronomers

00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:41.170 align:middle line:84%
detecting a signal from
another civilization

00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:43.410 align:middle line:84%
like you see in the
sci-fi movie "Contact."

00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:44.460 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:48.740 align:middle line:84%
But there's no getting away from
the fact that this is a way of,

00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:52.410 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, getting this
issue out of the fringe

00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:53.909 align:middle line:90%
and into the mainstream.

00:50:53.909 --> 00:50:54.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Big deal.

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Number of
people have speculated

00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:00.040 align:middle line:84%
that these people
know something.

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:01.510 align:middle line:90%
They know something's coming.

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:02.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about that.

00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:05.370 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's certainly
a question of it's

00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:07.987 align:middle line:90%
wise to prepare for it.

00:51:07.987 --> 00:51:09.570 align:middle line:84%
What's really
interesting about this--

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:11.620 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned that it
was multi-disciplinary.

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:15.120 align:middle line:84%
It's not just, I suppose
you'd say, the hard sciences,

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:17.790 align:middle line:84%
but it's the slightly
softer sciences, too.

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:20.470 align:middle line:84%
So yes, there were
astrophysicists

00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:23.420 align:middle line:84%
and biochemists at
these sorts of meetings.

00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:27.390 align:middle line:84%
But there were psychologists,
anthropologists,

00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:30.300 align:middle line:90%
and theologians looking at this.

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And for example, one
of the big questions

00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:37.910 align:middle line:84%
is what effect would discovery
of extraterrestrial life

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:41.260 align:middle line:84%
have on people's
religious beliefs?

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:43.814 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
huge row about that.

00:51:43.814 --> 00:51:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We talked about
that at dinner last night.

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:48.750 align:middle line:84%
You said that was one of the
more interesting and heated

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:50.620 align:middle line:90%
parts of the meeting.

00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Ted Peters, a theologian
who's looked at this,

00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:59.330 align:middle line:84%
said that so far as his
research is concerned,

00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:02.140 align:middle line:84%
people would be able to
easily incorporate this

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:03.660 align:middle line:90%
into their worldviews.

00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, the
Catholic Church has

00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:06.690 align:middle line:84%
said that, doctrinally,
there would

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:10.630 align:middle line:84%
be no problem with the existence
of extraterrestrial life

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:15.530 align:middle line:84%
because human beings may place
no creative limits on God.

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: Now, Ted
Peters said that.

00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Paul Davies, the physicist
and science commentator,

00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:26.590 align:middle line:84%
said that he very
much disputed that.

00:52:26.590 --> 00:52:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And he thought Christians would
have a huge problem with that

00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:35.370 align:middle line:84%
because the death and
resurrection of Christ

00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:37.760 align:middle line:84%
was so central to
Christian belief.

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.550 align:middle line:90%
He said, what?

00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Are we supposed to
believe that this happened

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:45.200 align:middle line:84%
on an almost infinite number of
worlds throughout the cosmos.

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.310 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:48.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
a debate to be had.

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:51.880 align:middle line:84%
But one of the other
characters at the Royal Society

00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:54.340 align:middle line:84%
meeting, one of the other
people who was discussed-- and I

00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:59.350 align:middle line:84%
think he chaired the
NASA/Library of Congress 2014

00:52:59.350 --> 00:52:59.850 align:middle line:90%
meeting.

00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:00.891 align:middle line:90%
He's going to chair that.

00:53:00.891 --> 00:53:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Is Steven Dick,
former NASA historian.

00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And he used the phrase
immortal thinking machines.

00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And I had to kind of kick
myself and think, wait a minute.

00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm at a scientific symposium
here, not a sci-fi convention.

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And here we have
the phrase immortal

00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:26.130 align:middle line:90%
thinking machines being used.

00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And his thought
was that we might

00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:33.080 align:middle line:84%
be in a largely post-biological
universe where civilizations

00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:36.210 align:middle line:84%
had gone through the
biological phrase

00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:43.600 align:middle line:84%
and had evolved or self-modified
into cyborgs or even

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:48.610 align:middle line:84%
into computer programs
or what have you.

00:53:48.610 --> 00:53:53.300 align:middle line:84%
The fact that the scientific
community is happy to sit down

00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:56.860 align:middle line:84%
and discuss this, where as a
few years ago this would've been

00:53:56.860 --> 00:54:01.270 align:middle line:84%
regarded not just as fringe
science but just as crazy

00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.850 align:middle line:90%
sci-fi--

00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:02.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:02.870 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:04.977 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: --is a sign
of the changing times.

00:54:04.977 --> 00:54:05.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:07.677 align:middle line:84%
It is encouraging, even
though for those of us

00:54:07.677 --> 00:54:09.260 align:middle line:84%
you have been studying
it for decades,

00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:12.980 align:middle line:84%
it seems like it's dragging
out at a terribly slow pace.

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:15.550 align:middle line:84%
It's, as the movie
"Contact" said--

00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:16.896 align:middle line:90%
we talked about this, too.

00:54:16.896 --> 00:54:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: We did.

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's the
classic line where

00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Ellie Arroway is keen
to move things on.

00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:25.597 align:middle line:90%
And her father, or rather--

00:54:25.597 --> 00:54:27.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She's in this
other world speaking

00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:29.510 align:middle line:84%
with her father who's
actually an alien.

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And she's told,
"Small moves, Ellie.

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:34.560 align:middle line:90%
Small moves."

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And then, the line is,
"You've taken a step.

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:40.537 align:middle line:90%
In a time, you'll take another."

00:54:40.537 --> 00:54:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:43.985 align:middle line:84%
>>POPE: But are
people impatient.

00:54:43.985 --> 00:54:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Of course, people talk about
disclosure and contact,

00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:49.430 align:middle line:90%
whatever phrase they use.

00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:51.120 align:middle line:90%
And they want it yesterday.

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe that's not
the way it will happen.

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:56.190 align:middle line:84%
One of the interesting
things, I think,

00:54:56.190 --> 00:54:59.930 align:middle line:84%
people talk about the conflict
between science and religion.

00:54:59.930 --> 00:55:02.420 align:middle line:84%
That's something that's
gone back hundreds of years.

00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:05.950 align:middle line:84%
When you look at these
astrobiology symposia

00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:09.200 align:middle line:84%
where you actually have
theologians as part of them,

00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:13.100 align:middle line:84%
you've got to say that if
there is a conflict coming,

00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:16.010 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to be a conflict
between science and religion,

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:18.510 align:middle line:84%
but between science
and government.

00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And here's what I think is
the interesting question.

00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:25.360 align:middle line:84%
What if the scientific
community has

00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:29.870 align:middle line:84%
what it thinks is absolute
proof positive of not just

00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:32.410 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial
life, but intelligent

00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:33.540 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial life.

00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:36.910 align:middle line:84%
What if they do, to
use the SETI analogy,

00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:40.240 align:middle line:84%
pick up a signal from
another civilization.

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Would the government be
comfortable with that signal,

00:55:43.570 --> 00:55:46.280 align:middle line:90%
that message, being made public?

00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:47.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure they would be.

00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Particularly-- and here's
the really intriguing piece

00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:53.010 align:middle line:90%
of speculation.

00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:55.080 align:middle line:84%
What if we picked
up an alien message

00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:57.060 align:middle line:90%
that we couldn't decipher?

00:55:57.060 --> 00:56:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, all sorts of
questions like this

00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:04.000 align:middle line:84%
were discussed, certainly, at
the Royal Society meetings.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.180 align:middle line:84%
One of the key things that
came out of the second meeting

00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:10.330 align:middle line:84%
was the question,
if we get a message

00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:14.320 align:middle line:84%
from another civilization,
should we reply?

00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:17.170 align:middle line:84%
If we do reply, who
should send that reply?

00:56:17.170 --> 00:56:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Who speaks, truly,
for planet Earth?

00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:23.440 align:middle line:90%
And what should that reply say?

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And my goodness, if you think
that scientific meetings are

00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:32.310 align:middle line:84%
orderly and well
conducted, the level

00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:38.270 align:middle line:84%
of debate and acrimony at
times there was palpable.

00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:44.440 align:middle line:84%
There was talk of sages,
group of wise people

00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:46.360 align:middle line:84%
maybe speaking for
all the planet.

00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Someone, another scientist
shouted out from the back,

00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:52.310 align:middle line:84%
do the other seven billion
of us get a say in this?

00:56:52.310 --> 00:56:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We can only
imagine the scenario.

00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:56:55.960 --> 00:57:01.030 align:middle line:84%
So I think all these symposia,
the Royal Society ones,

00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:06.460 align:middle line:84%
the NASA/Library of Congress
ones-- five years ago,

00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:08.705 align:middle line:84%
ten certainly, they
wouldn't have happened.

00:57:08.705 --> 00:57:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wouldn't
have happened.

00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:10.585 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:57:10.585 --> 00:57:12.300 align:middle line:90%
So that is encouraging.

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes, it is.

00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And on the
subject of messages, again,

00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:17.620 align:middle line:84%
as we spoke about in
the first conversation

00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:21.700 align:middle line:84%
on this, the decoding of the
message of the binary code

00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:27.060 align:middle line:84%
that was downloaded into
Jim Penniston, that's

00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:29.640 align:middle line:84%
available for people
to look at, correct?

00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Yes.

00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:36.660 align:middle line:10%
We reproduced all 16
pages of Jim's notebook

00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:38.620 align:middle line:10%
in the back of "Encounter
in Rendlesham Forest"

00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:41.620 align:middle line:10%
because we wanted people
to have the raw data.

00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:44.130 align:middle line:10%
Yes, there's a couple of
translations kicking around

00:57:44.130 --> 00:57:48.200 align:middle line:10%
on the internet that have
been put forward in TV shows.

00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:52.100 align:middle line:84%
But we wanted to say to people,
look, this has been suggested.

00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:53.290 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's the answer.

00:57:53.290 --> 00:57:56.360 align:middle line:84%
But other people out there,
other people in the UFO

00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:59.840 align:middle line:84%
community, other people
in the esoteric community

00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:01.850 align:middle line:84%
will have their
own ideas and want

00:58:01.850 --> 00:58:04.590 align:middle line:84%
to do their own direct,
first person research.

00:58:04.590 --> 00:58:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And we'd like people to
have that opportunity.

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:10.810 align:middle line:84%
So we thought give the
people the information.

00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:14.634 align:middle line:84%
Well, on that note,
we'll sign off.

00:58:14.634 --> 00:58:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And I just want
to thank you again

00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:20.740 align:middle line:84%
for doing such a credible
work that can really

00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:24.930 align:middle line:84%
be used as a tool for people
to reach out and bridge

00:58:24.930 --> 00:58:27.580 align:middle line:84%
these gaps between
skeptics and believers.

00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:28.890 align:middle line:90%
You've done a beautiful job.

00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And thank you,
again, for spending

00:58:30.610 --> 00:58:32.900 align:middle line:84%
a couple of hours
with me on this, Nick.

00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>POPE: Thank you.

00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:35.463 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, the
title of the book

00:58:35.463 --> 00:58:37.080 align:middle line:10%
is "Encounter at
Rendlesham Forest."

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:39.860 align:middle line:10%
And it's what I consider
to be the definitive work

00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:42.330 align:middle line:10%
on the structure of
encounter and cover up,

00:58:42.330 --> 00:58:45.000 align:middle line:10%
one you can share with
skeptical friends and family.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.320 align:middle line:84%
We will ultimately need
to be on the same page

00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:50.790 align:middle line:84%
one day as to what our cosmos
and our future hold for us.

00:58:50.790 --> 00:58:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:58:55.320 --> 00:59:12.967 align:middle line:90%
