00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:23.220 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Rupert
Sheldrake has done more than

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.490 align:middle line:10%
nearly any scientists making
the link between science

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.800 align:middle line:10%
and the field of
ubiquitous intelligence.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.830 align:middle line:10%
His groundbreaking work was
on the morphogenetic field,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.260 align:middle line:10%
where genetic history is
passed on through a field

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.550 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Today, Rupert is speaking about
the effects of having drifted

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.310 align:middle line:84%
far away from our
spiritual moorings

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.150 align:middle line:84%
into a world of
atheistic materialism,

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.860 align:middle line:84%
and he makes the case for
returning to our roots.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.940 align:middle line:90%
Rupert, welcome.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.630 align:middle line:90%
We're so happy to have you here.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.699 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for taking the
tube over to meet us.

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>> RUPERT SHELDRAKE:
Good to be here.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.390 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here with you.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.500 align:middle line:90%
It's been a while.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.120 align:middle line:84%
I think we talked about--
it's been about eight years

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.590 align:middle line:90%
since I last interviewed you.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And I love your new
work, because it's

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.050 align:middle line:84%
bringing a really essential
conversation back.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And I asked you off camera
how the scientific field was

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.200 align:middle line:84%
receiving your work and said,
they're primarily ignoring it.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.830 align:middle line:90%
Yet I know many scientists--

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed many, many
physicists and scientists.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.375 align:middle line:84%
And yet still, even though
they can't talk about it

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:24.750 align:middle line:84%
or acknowledge
your book, there's

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:84%
this deep yearning for the
magic and mysticism and ethics

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.030 align:middle line:90%
of life again.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.060 align:middle line:84%
So tell us what prompted
you to write this book.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.300 align:middle line:10%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, it's
partly that I myself,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.910 align:middle line:10%
being a scientist and also
interested in spiritual

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.540 align:middle line:10%
practices, have been thinking
about the connections between

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.430 align:middle line:10%
the two for years.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Most of my books are
primarily scientific.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.210 align:middle line:10%
My most recent book before
this, "Science Set Free,"

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.270 align:middle line:10%
is about the dogmas of
science and how science

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.100 align:middle line:10%
needs to move beyond them.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.770 align:middle line:10%
And so that's about
scientific issues.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.340 align:middle line:10%
And my previous books
are primarily on science.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.920 align:middle line:10%
So this is the first
time I've really tried

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.050 align:middle line:10%
to connect these two realms.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.889 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.138 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: And the reason
it's possible to do it is

00:02:11.138 --> 00:02:14.050 align:middle line:84%
because there's now been a
lot of scientific research

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.740 align:middle line:84%
on the effects of religious
and spiritual practices.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And on the whole, the great
majority of this research

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.670 align:middle line:84%
has shown that people
who do these practices

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.770 align:middle line:84%
are happier, healthier,
and even live longer.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So the positive effects of
these practices are very strong.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.290 align:middle line:84%
The other side of the
coin is that if you

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.810 align:middle line:84%
don't do these things,
you're unhappier,

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.120 align:middle line:84%
you're unhealthier,
and live shorter.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.370 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
militant atheism ought

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.530 align:middle line:90%
to come with a health warning.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.860 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you talk about
that in your book.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because
you've run the gamut.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.340 align:middle line:84%
You started out as an
Anglican private school boy--

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.480 align:middle line:90%
well, public school here.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.630 align:middle line:84%
We call it private
school in America--

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.360 align:middle line:84%
who had access to a lot of
the magical things of life,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.640 align:middle line:84%
secret gardens, and
so forth Let's talk

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.350 align:middle line:84%
about your upbringing
just a little

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.140 align:middle line:84%
bit to lay the foundation
because of this whole notion

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:90%
of coming full circle.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, I was raised
by a loving family who were

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.760 align:middle line:90%
committed Christians.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.520 align:middle line:84%
My father was a herbalist
and a pharmacist

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.340 align:middle line:84%
and was very
interested in plants.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:90%
So I had gardens.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.860 align:middle line:84%
He taught me about
wild flowers and trees.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.360 align:middle line:84%
I kept many, many
different kinds of pets.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.220 align:middle line:84%
My mother was very
supportive, really.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.540 align:middle line:90%
And I went to a boarding school.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to do
biology because I wanted

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.840 align:middle line:90%
to study animals and plants.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.155 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.155 --> 00:03:48.600 align:middle line:90%
And two things happened.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.150 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I began to notice
that if you study biology

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.940 align:middle line:84%
as a science, the first
thing you do with the things

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.860 align:middle line:90%
you're studying is kill them.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.860 align:middle line:84%
So biology, which is meant
to be the science of life,

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.550 align:middle line:84%
was actually mainly about the
science of dead organisms.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.350 align:middle line:84%
You talked about in that
book the vivisecting

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.400 align:middle line:90%
of little animals.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.680 align:middle line:90%
Vivisection is part of it.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.850 align:middle line:90%
Dissection.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.680 align:middle line:84%
You start off with dissection,
then move on to vivisection.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
my science teachers

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.709 align:middle line:84%
made it very clear that
science equals atheism.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.890 align:middle line:84%
The scientific worldview,
the mechanistic worldview

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.400 align:middle line:84%
has no space for
God or spirit in it.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.550 align:middle line:84%
The whole of nature works
like an automatic machine.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Once it's started
off, it just goes

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.670 align:middle line:90%
on and on in much the same way.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.910 align:middle line:84%
And animals and plants are
treated as just machines.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And so where's the spirit,
where is the soul in all that?

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Answer?

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.970 align:middle line:90%
Nowhere.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.620 align:middle line:84%
So science and the way I was
taught it equaled atheism.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And so because I wanted
to be a scientist,

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.210 align:middle line:84%
I sort of accepted
this package deal.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.110 align:middle line:90%
Became an atheist.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But how was
that for you, really,

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.860 align:middle line:84%
on more of an emotional
level, to make--

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, was it a simple
leap to become an atheist

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.710 align:middle line:84%
after having had a rather
traditional upbringing, where

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.110 align:middle line:84%
there were rituals and
things that you actually

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.904 align:middle line:84%
believed in that were a part
of the great source of life?

00:05:13.904 --> 00:05:16.570 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, you see, one
of the things that made it easy

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.390 align:middle line:84%
was the fact that the school I
went to, an Anglican boarding

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.090 align:middle line:84%
school, the rituals
were compulsory.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.620 align:middle line:84%
We had to go to
chapel every Sunday.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Ah, yes.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: I was in the
school choir, the chapel choir.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.070 align:middle line:90%
I loved the music.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.130 align:middle line:90%
I loved the singing.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.379 align:middle line:84%
So becoming an atheism didn't
mean the rituals stopped.

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:34.295 align:middle line:90%
The rituals continued.

00:05:34.295 --> 00:05:35.211 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I see, yes.

00:05:35.211 --> 00:05:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: And so I was able
to benefit from them while,

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.116 align:middle line:84%
at the same time,
disbelieving in them.

00:05:42.116 --> 00:05:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Interesting, because
you almost have to create

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.720 align:middle line:84%
a cognitive dissonance of sorts
as a scientist who still wishes

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.310 align:middle line:84%
to maintain some of the
spiritual magic in one's life.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, I just took
it as an aesthetic pleasure.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And actually aesthetics,
the sense of beauty,

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.530 align:middle line:84%
is part of the divine
as I now see it.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.450 align:middle line:90%
You became an atheist.

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:05.866 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: I
became an atheist.

00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Then when I went to Cambridge
as an undergraduate,

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.940 align:middle line:84%
I joined the main atheist
society, the Cambridge Humanist

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.890 align:middle line:90%
Society.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.660 align:middle line:84%
The trouble is that
after a term or two,

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.460 align:middle line:84%
I began to find it
all rather dull.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people were just sort
of told jokes against religion

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.140 align:middle line:84%
and made arguments against,
if Adam and Eve were

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.320 align:middle line:84%
created by God, how come
they've got navels in paintings?

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.210 align:middle line:90%
You know, that kind of thing.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Almost kind of schoolboy
level atheist arguments.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:40.840 align:middle line:84%
So it became not very
interesting to me.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I got interested
in philosophy.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.530 align:middle line:84%
I was looking for
a deeper meaning,

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.250 align:middle line:84%
and I also started looking for
a deeper way of understanding

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.640 align:middle line:84%
living organisms, because the
mechanistic theories seemed

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.565 align:middle line:90%
to me too limited.

00:06:52.565 --> 00:06:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, let's talk
about the philosophical part,

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.260 align:middle line:90%
because you started--

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.140 align:middle line:84%
you took a little dive
into Freud and Karl Marx

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.060 align:middle line:90%
during this era.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Oh, well I
started off with the atheist

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.820 align:middle line:90%
philosopher.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.180 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I read Freud.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.830 align:middle line:10%
And Freud reinforced
all my atheist views

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.310 align:middle line:10%
because he saw religion
as just a projection of--

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.930 align:middle line:10%
God's just a projection
of a father figure,

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.430 align:middle line:10%
and these are just
basic needs built

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:24.580 align:middle line:10%
into our psyche to provide
us with comfort and illusory

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.450 align:middle line:10%
support.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:30.970 align:middle line:84%
So he was unrelenting in
his dismissal of religion.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.580 align:middle line:10%
And Marx, who had to
view that it was just

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.350 align:middle line:10%
a conspiracy of priests
provide the opium of the people

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:42.440 align:middle line:10%
to stop people
revolting and achieving

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.760 align:middle line:10%
the dictatorship
of the proletariat.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.010 align:middle line:90%
I quite liked all that.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.280 align:middle line:84%
But again, it began
to seem rather

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.604 align:middle line:90%
unsatisfying after a while.

00:07:52.604 --> 00:07:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I
would think it would.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.996 align:middle line:84%
Let's go on to
Sir Julian Huxley.

00:07:56.996 --> 00:07:58.370 align:middle line:84%
That was kind of
an interesting--

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.120 align:middle line:84%
he was just a little
mention in your book,

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.320 align:middle line:84%
but it really takes you
down a rabbit hole that

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.960 align:middle line:84%
starts looking frighteningly
like some of what's

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.780 align:middle line:84%
happening today, even
almost crossing over

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.520 align:middle line:90%
into the transhuman movement.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.730 align:middle line:10%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, Sir Julian
Huxley was the leading secular

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.400 align:middle line:10%
humanist of his era.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.630 align:middle line:10%
And he came gave a talk to the
Cambridge Humanist Association.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:21.440 align:middle line:90%
So I went to it.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.440 align:middle line:84%
He was a famous
evolutionary biologist.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.700 align:middle line:90%
I was doing biology.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And he gave this talk about the
need to enhance the human race.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.929 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the lower
classes are out-breeding

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:36.730 align:middle line:90%
the intelligent classes.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:41.320 align:middle line:84%
So this would be very bad news
for the future of humanity

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.680 align:middle line:84%
because the poor breed
like rabbits and the rich

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.370 align:middle line:90%
don't have enough children.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.380 align:middle line:84%
So what we need is to
uplift the human race

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.790 align:middle line:84%
through selective breeding
and what we need--

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:57.280 align:middle line:84%
the simple way of doing that
is through sperm donors.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And the ideal sperm
donor should be

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:03.610 align:middle line:84%
a man of distinguished
scientific background, who's

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.490 align:middle line:84%
achieved eminence
in public life,

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:10.660 align:middle line:84%
who's preferably an
eminent scientist,

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and who is widely recognized and
esteemed for his achievements.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out the
perfect sperm donor

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.840 align:middle line:90%
was Sir Julian Huxley himself.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.048 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: His very own self.

00:09:21.048 --> 00:09:22.222 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:09:22.222 --> 00:09:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I
wasn't sure whether he

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.042 align:middle line:90%
was serious about this.

00:09:26.042 --> 00:09:27.750 align:middle line:84%
But funnily enough,
just a few years ago,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.250 align:middle line:84%
only three or four
years ago, I was

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.630 align:middle line:84%
friendly with his
son, Francis Huxley,

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.770 align:middle line:90%
who died a little while ago.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And Francis started
getting emails and letters

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.110 align:middle line:84%
from people saying that
they'd been doing research

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.300 align:middle line:84%
on their ancestry
and they had reason

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:48.610 align:middle line:84%
to believe that their father was
his father, Sir Julian Huxley,

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:52.540 align:middle line:84%
and would he spit into a
test tube for DNA tests

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.612 align:middle line:90%
so they could find out--

00:09:53.612 --> 00:09:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.260 align:middle line:90%
How many of these showed up?

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, the
thing is, quite a lot.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And Francis was
appalled by this.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.730 align:middle line:84%
He didn't get on
well with his father.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.271 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I just
find this so funny.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.916 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:10:07.916 --> 00:10:10.500 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, he
was so-- so I said to him,

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.997 align:middle line:84%
what do you do
with these letters?

00:10:11.997 --> 00:10:14.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, do you
call them step-siblings?

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.280 align:middle line:84%
What do you call
them at that point?

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, they would
be half brothers and sisters.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:18.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:18.550 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:19.630 align:middle line:90%
Half brothers and sisters.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.050 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.550 align:middle line:90%
Maybe dozens of them.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:24.670 align:middle line:90%
And all of a sudden--

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.830 align:middle line:90%
he was over 90 at the time.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:30.400 align:middle line:84%
The last thing he wanted was
all these people showing up

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:35.460 align:middle line:84%
who claim to have been half
brothers and half sisters.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.580 align:middle line:84%
So I said, what do you
do with these requests?

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.570 align:middle line:84%
Have you spat into a test
tube for the DNA test?

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:41.930 align:middle line:90%
He said, of course not.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.020 align:middle line:84%
I said, what do you
do with the requests?

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.700 align:middle line:84%
I just throw the letters into
the wastepaper basket, he said.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh my God.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, that experiment
ended poorly for him,

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.550 align:middle line:84%
but I suppose his
father would have

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:58.960 align:middle line:84%
been proud to have had so many
essential clones of himself

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.071 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:11:00.071 --> 00:11:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: With enough
scientific curiosity to find

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.930 align:middle line:90%
out who their father was, yes.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.186 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:11:05.186 --> 00:11:06.680 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.520 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk
about your transition

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.199 align:middle line:84%
away from this phase
of your education.

00:11:14.199 --> 00:11:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, I think the
first thing that happened was

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.250 align:middle line:84%
that I began to find the machine
theory of life inadequate

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.520 align:middle line:84%
for understanding
living organisms.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.220 align:middle line:10%
And I then discovered a
holistic approach to science

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:31.080 align:middle line:10%
through reading the works of
the German poet Goethe, who

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.940 align:middle line:10%
in the beginning of the
19th century, around 1800,

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:39.930 align:middle line:10%
was trying to find a more
holistic approach to nature,

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.180 align:middle line:10%
where you could base
your understanding

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.150 align:middle line:10%
not just on breaking
things down into bits,

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:50.580 align:middle line:10%
but seeing them as a whole
and literally seeing things.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.280 align:middle line:84%
One of the things he did was
looked at plants in detail

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.760 align:middle line:84%
and found that you could
find transitional forms

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.870 align:middle line:84%
between leaves and sepals and
sepals and petals and petals

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.220 align:middle line:90%
and stamens.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And he had the idea
that these were

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:09.540 align:middle line:84%
all morphing of an underlying
leaf type structure that

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.450 align:middle line:84%
could change into
these other organs

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.900 align:middle line:84%
and that you could actually
see by looking at them how

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.450 align:middle line:90%
one form changed into another.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And that was looking at
forms and understanding forms

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:25.530 align:middle line:84%
by direct experience, rather
than grinding everything up

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.840 align:middle line:84%
and analyzing the
chemicals inside it,

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.470 align:middle line:90%
which was the usual approach.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.560 align:middle line:84%
So that pointed me towards
a more holistic way

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.780 align:middle line:90%
of seeing things.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want to go
on doing science to--

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I did very
well at Cambridge.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.030 align:middle line:90%
I got a double first.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.600 align:middle line:90%
I got college prizes.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.280 align:middle line:90%
I got university botany prize.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.850 align:middle line:90%
You know, I was the--

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.910 align:middle line:84%
scientific researchers
wanted me to work with them,

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.160 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't want to
do a PhD straightaway.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.450 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to sort of--

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:59.920 align:middle line:84%
is this what I
really want to do?

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.930 align:middle line:90%
So I was lucky.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.990 align:middle line:84%
I got a fellowship at Harvard,
called a Frank Knox Fellowship,

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:07.290 align:middle line:84%
which gave me a blissfully
free year at Harvard, where

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.570 align:middle line:84%
I studied history and
philosophy of science

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.340 align:middle line:90%
to get a big picture.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.030 align:middle line:90%
And this was a long time ago.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.600 align:middle line:10%
This was soon after Thomas
Kuhn's famous book had just

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.960 align:middle line:10%
been published, "The Structure
of Scientific Revolutions",

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.080 align:middle line:10%
where he introduced the idea of
paradigms and paradigm shifts.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's now a cliche, but
he published the book in 1962.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.550 align:middle line:90%
I was at Harvard in 1963.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.470 align:middle line:90%
So this was the latest thing.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Only people in philosophy
of science knew about it.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.330 align:middle line:84%
It hadn't reached
popular culture.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was blown
away by this book

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.410 align:middle line:84%
because what it showed was
that the way science is thought

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.710 align:middle line:84%
of at any given time
is not the truth, which

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.420 align:middle line:84%
is what I'd been led
to believe it was,

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.910 align:middle line:90%
it's a model of reality.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.155 align:middle line:90%
And these models can change.

00:13:53.155 --> 00:13:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And the history of science
has plenty of examples

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.810 align:middle line:90%
of these models changing.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.530 align:middle line:84%
So I suddenly thought, wow,
well, this machine theory

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:04.870 align:middle line:84%
of life that
dominates everything

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:08.230 align:middle line:84%
isn't the only way of looking at
it, and the model could change.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.900 align:middle line:84%
A new kind of biology
might be possible.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.930 align:middle line:84%
This gave me tremendous
sense of hope for the future,

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.240 align:middle line:84%
that science didn't
have to remain locked

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:20.260 align:middle line:84%
into this atheistic,
materialist, narrow,

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.450 align:middle line:84%
it's all just the
molecules, the mind's

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.490 align:middle line:90%
just the brain point of view.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:27.690 align:middle line:84%
It could be
interestingly broader.

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:29.860 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't see
how to go there.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.282 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how to
move in that direction.

00:14:32.282 --> 00:14:34.240 align:middle line:84%
But at least it gave me
the hope it was worth--

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
it's interesting

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:36.696 align:middle line:84%
because you're dealing
with institutions.

00:14:36.696 --> 00:14:38.695 align:middle line:84%
At that time you were
dealing with institutions.

00:14:38.695 --> 00:14:40.894 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking about
funding and tenure

00:14:40.894 --> 00:14:42.310 align:middle line:84%
and all these sorts
of things that

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:43.610 align:middle line:90%
are threatened by new ideas.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:44.410 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, at that stage, in
my particular position,

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:51.940 align:middle line:84%
the only way forward to remain
in institutional science

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:55.030 align:middle line:84%
was to do a PhD, which
I went back to Cambridge

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.160 align:middle line:90%
and did on plant development.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And I worked an area where
I could think holistically.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.430 align:middle line:84%
I worked on plants
because I'd had

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:05.920 align:middle line:84%
enough experience of working
on animals to realize

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.680 align:middle line:84%
that a scientific career
working on animals

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.280 align:middle line:84%
involves killing animals
on an industrial scale,

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.740 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't want to spend
my career killing animals.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.980 align:middle line:84%
I went into biology because
I loved animals and kept them

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:22.000 align:middle line:84%
and had pets I was
really fond of.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.286 align:middle line:90%
So plants seemed to me--

00:15:23.286 --> 00:15:24.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it does
involve killing plants,

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.560 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't feel
too bad about that.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.815 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even
vegetarians eat lettuce

00:15:28.815 --> 00:15:31.160 align:middle line:84%
and that's a living
leaf and so on.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:31.960 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.390 align:middle line:84%
I felt OK about doing
research on plants.

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:38.200 align:middle line:84%
I had a great time in
Cambridge doing this.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.140 align:middle line:10%
And while I was a graduate
student at Cambridge,

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.560 align:middle line:10%
I met a very eccentric group
of philosophers, called

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.070 align:middle line:10%
the Epiphany Philosophers,
who had some very high powered

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:50.230 align:middle line:10%
philosophers in it-- the
professor of philosophy

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:53.050 align:middle line:10%
at Cambridge, a woman
called Dorothy Emmet

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.330 align:middle line:10%
who was professor of
philosophy at Manchester, who'd

00:15:55.330 --> 00:16:01.330 align:middle line:10%
studied with Whitehead, the
great holistic philosopher,

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:05.800 align:middle line:10%
quantum physicists, some
Buddhists, some people

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.200 align:middle line:10%
into tai chi.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And this group was
basically Anglican--

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:14.860 align:middle line:84%
contained some Quakers as well,
but also Buddhists and holistic

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.640 align:middle line:90%
medicine and so on--

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.590 align:middle line:84%
and was exploring a way
forward for science.

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And everyone in the group
was influenced by Kuhn's idea

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.210 align:middle line:90%
of a paradigm shift.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:26.825 align:middle line:84%
What would be the
next paradigm shift?

00:16:26.825 --> 00:16:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How fortunate
you found this group.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.380 align:middle line:84%
I was incredibly fortunate to
find because nobody else was

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.820 align:middle line:90%
talking about these things.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.660 align:middle line:90%
And so I was in this group.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.650 align:middle line:90%
And we had four retreats a year.

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:42.020 align:middle line:84%
We lived in a windmill
on the coast of Norfolk,

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.850 align:middle line:84%
a place called Burnham Overy
Staithe, as a community.

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:48.750 align:middle line:84%
So for a week we all
lived as a community.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.150 align:middle line:90%
We ate together.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:53.900 align:middle line:84%
We had a rota to cook
and wash up and things.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Every morning we had a
seminar on some topic.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:00.260 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes people
like Arthur Koestler

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.110 align:middle line:10%
came for these seminars.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:07.339 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes holistically minded
writers and philosophers.

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:09.440 align:middle line:90%
Mostly it was among ourselves.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.480 align:middle line:84%
The implications
of quantum theory.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.630 align:middle line:84%
The nature of consciousness,
the possibility

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:18.200 align:middle line:84%
of a holistic biology,
the limitations of the DNA

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.930 align:middle line:90%
approach to life, and so on.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:23.126 align:middle line:84%
This was amazing
to be part of it.

00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It
sounds like heaven.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: It was.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.230 align:middle line:90%
It was hard hitting, though.

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:32.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these discussions
were very, very hard hitting.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.840 align:middle line:84%
There was no nonsense tolerated,
and people were often reduced

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.080 align:middle line:90%
to tears in these discussions.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:42.590 align:middle line:84%
But because it was a
religious type community,

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.300 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't really into
that side of it,

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.590 align:middle line:84%
but we had every morning,
before the day began,

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.440 align:middle line:84%
we did the Anglican
matins service

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.740 align:middle line:84%
and in the evening
the evensong service,

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:58.220 align:middle line:84%
chanting, in
plainsong, the psalms.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And each day began
with something

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.040 align:middle line:90%
called the Chapter of Faults.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And we were all in these
white robes in the top floor

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.760 align:middle line:90%
of the windmill in a circle.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And one by one, starting
with the oldest,

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.740 align:middle line:84%
we had to go round and
confess to the group things

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.770 align:middle line:84%
that we'd done that
would have upset people.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:19.530 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like deep,
existential faults.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:21.772 align:middle line:84%
It was not doing your
share of the washing

00:18:21.772 --> 00:18:22.730 align:middle line:90%
up, that kind of thing.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.188 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So ideally within
the community in the last week

00:18:25.188 --> 00:18:27.316 align:middle line:84%
or 24 hours, not your
deeply held secrets.

00:18:27.316 --> 00:18:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: No, nothing--

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.170 align:middle line:84%
no, no, no, not
deeply held secrets.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Just things that
might have upset

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.720 align:middle line:90%
other people in the community.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And first you confessed these
things, then you had to say,

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.220 align:middle line:84%
if anyone has anything
else to remind me of,

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.450 align:middle line:90%
I'd be grateful to be told.

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And because this was a
somewhat argumentative group,

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:48.920 align:middle line:84%
quite often people did say
things that had upset them.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And what this did
was cleared the air,

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.430 align:middle line:84%
and then we all sang
together after this.

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And it sort of meant that
this rather cantankerous group

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.980 align:middle line:84%
of people, very argumentative,
could come together every day

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:04.410 align:middle line:90%
and start each day afresh.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you did have
any grudge or upset,

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.390 align:middle line:90%
you could bring it out then.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.160 align:middle line:84%
So this actually
worked very well.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:17.580 align:middle line:84%
In this period of time, what
really came to the fore for you

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.804 align:middle line:90%
as a young man?

00:19:18.804 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well,
at this stage,

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.530 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual side
wasn't the main thing.

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:27.540 align:middle line:84%
What came to the fore for me
was the idea that consciousness

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.230 align:middle line:84%
wasn't explained by
science, that quantum theory

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:35.150 align:middle line:84%
had completely broken with the
old mechanical view of nature,

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and determinism
was part of nature.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.520 align:middle line:84%
There was an involvement
of consciousness in science

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.320 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.740 align:middle line:84%
You can't have observations
without an observer.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.650 align:middle line:84%
The mind is involved
in producing science.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And our mental models are
what underlies science.

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:56.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not reality itself
that we're seeing.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:20:01.220 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing our models of
reality, and those change.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And this encouraged
me to think there

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.510 align:middle line:84%
could be a more holistic
view in biology,

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:08.720 align:middle line:84%
which would also include a
more holistic view of medicine.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Instead of medicine just
being about surgery and drugs,

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:18.580 align:middle line:84%
it could include consciousness,
expectation, belief, and what's

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.360 align:middle line:90%
now called the placebo effect.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:84%
All these things were
important ingredients.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.906 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a bit
of a non-sequitur,

00:20:25.906 --> 00:20:28.280 align:middle line:84%
but as I'm listening to you
and thinking of Goethe and so

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.680 align:middle line:84%
forth, my mind wanders
quite naturally

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.470 align:middle line:84%
to Rudolf Steiner and a lot
of what he brought forward

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.360 align:middle line:90%
by way of a system.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Any quick comments you
might have before we

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.910 align:middle line:90%
start moving on to India?

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:44.350 align:middle line:10%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, Steiner
was a follower of Goethe,

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:48.550 align:middle line:10%
and many of the things I found
interesting in Goethe were also

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:51.110 align:middle line:10%
things that Steiner
found interesting.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:52.920 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know about
Steiner at that stage,

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.290 align:middle line:90%
or only vaguely heard of him.

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:55.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: So I didn't get
these ideas through Steiner.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.630 align:middle line:84%
I got them through
Goethe himself.

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: I
later discovered,

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:05.680 align:middle line:84%
not in that phase as a
graduate student at Cambridge,

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.380 align:middle line:84%
but later, people said, did
you know there's this whole

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:12.130 align:middle line:84%
movement following Steiner, and
they look at plants in a way

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.800 align:middle line:84%
that is holistic
following Goethe?

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And they even have
schools where they

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.100 align:middle line:84%
teach science in a
much more holistic way,

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.300 align:middle line:90%
Waldorf or Steiner schools.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.301 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know anything
about that at that stage.

00:21:23.301 --> 00:21:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's take your life
forward to India,

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.640 align:middle line:84%
where you spent a
number of years.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And then where you met a
Sufi mystic and the thing

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:35.470 align:middle line:84%
he said to you
that really started

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.700 align:middle line:90%
shifting things for you.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.450 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, I
went to India twice.

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:44.450 align:middle line:84%
In 1968 I got a
Royal Society grant

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:47.060 align:middle line:84%
to study tropical
rainforest plants

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:51.310 align:middle line:84%
at the University of Malaya
in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And they gave me one of
those old style airline

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.270 align:middle line:84%
tickets where you could break
the journey as often as you

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:57.070 align:middle line:90%
liked.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.690 align:middle line:84%
So I decided, well, instead
of just flying over India,

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:03.350 align:middle line:84%
I'll get off in India and
just taste a bit of India

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:04.700 align:middle line:90%
on the way.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I'd only been there two
or three days in Delhi

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:10.430 align:middle line:84%
when I ran into, by chance, the
one person I knew in India, who

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:13.100 align:middle line:84%
was a graduate student
friend from Cambridge, who

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:16.730 align:middle line:84%
was an anthropologist
living with a family

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:19.010 align:middle line:84%
in a remote village
in the Himalayas.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And he said, would
you like to come?

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:21.509 align:middle line:90%
I'm going back tomorrow.

00:22:21.509 --> 00:22:25.072 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to come
to my village with me?

00:22:25.072 --> 00:22:26.330 align:middle line:90%
So I said, yes.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:29.650 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the British Airways
office, changed my ticket.

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was plunged
into rural Indian life

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.020 align:middle line:84%
in a village which
didn't have electricity.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:40.280 align:middle line:90%
And of course, no radio or TV.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was living in a
kind of medieval world.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.260 align:middle line:90%
It was fascinating.

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And here were people
of great faith.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:49.090 align:middle line:90%
I met this guru.

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:50.690 align:middle line:84%
We went for a walk
along the valley,

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:84%
and I saw this orange clad
figure sitting in a cave.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said to my friend,
Johnny, who's that?

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, he's
the local holy man.

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:02.680 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't heard of
sadhus and holy men.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.170 align:middle line:84%
I'd only been in India
three or four days.

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And there I was in the
heart of rural India.

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And the sadhu beckoned us,
and we sat down in the cave.

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And then he offered
me-- he'd got this clay

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:16.910 align:middle line:90%
pipe, smoke coming out.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:18.310 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what it was.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And he said, would you like to
try some of Shiva's holy plant?

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.110 align:middle line:90%
So I said, well, why not.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.460 align:middle line:90%
Here I am in India.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.900 align:middle line:90%
Have a few puffs of this.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was an incredibly
strong cannabis thing.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:32.340 align:middle line:90%
I'd never had cannabis before.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And he started with a prayer
for the Enlightenment of the God

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.550 align:middle line:90%
on the smoke.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.050 align:middle line:84%
So it was a kind of
spiritual practice.

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:43.820 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just smoking
a joint at a party.

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.740 align:middle line:90%
It was completely different.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.680 align:middle line:90%
And I felt completely different.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.860 align:middle line:84%
When I walked out of the
cave into the sunlight,

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:51.985 align:middle line:90%
there were the Himalayas.

00:23:51.985 --> 00:23:57.430 align:middle line:84%
There were these green-- here
was the green hills, the river.

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:59.920 align:middle line:84%
I was in a state of bliss
that I'd never known before.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.520 align:middle line:90%
I though, this is incredible.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.870 align:middle line:84%
I felt really home,
really connected,

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and as if a vast new world
was opening up for me.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I spent another two
or three months in India,

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:14.580 align:middle line:84%
and I was very, very
impressed by it.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.420 align:middle line:90%
A whole civilisation based on--

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:21.950 align:middle line:84%
everyone there had a kind
of spiritual dimension.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:23.700 align:middle line:90%
Then I got to Sri Lanka.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And I visited a
Buddhist monastery

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:26.650 align:middle line:90%
and talked to some monks.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.330 align:middle line:84%
And they told me
about meditation.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Then I finally got to Malaysia,
and I had a marvelous time

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.520 align:middle line:84%
studying rainforest
plants and being embedded

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.280 align:middle line:90%
in this very exotic culture.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.640 align:middle line:84%
At that time, the
lowland rainforest jungle

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.160 align:middle line:84%
came up within 10
miles of Kuala Lumpur.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:50.180 align:middle line:84%
You could be in primal
rainforest within half an hour

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.320 align:middle line:90%
from the university.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, that's
all been cleared

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and development and
so on has taken over.

00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:01.400 align:middle line:84%
But this was a complete eye
opener for me-- biologically,

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.490 align:middle line:84%
to be in the middle of
a rainforest, tropical

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:07.700 align:middle line:84%
environment; culturally,
to be exposed

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.430 align:middle line:84%
to Hinduism, Buddhism
in Sri Lanka,

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:13.130 align:middle line:84%
and then in Malaysia,
Islam, where most people are

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:15.885 align:middle line:90%
Muslim, and Chinese.

00:25:15.885 --> 00:25:18.200 align:middle line:84%
There were many Chinese
there so we came

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.080 align:middle line:90%
across Taoism and Confucianism.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And I met tribal people
because they worked with us

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.060 align:middle line:90%
on our botanical expeditions.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So this was a tremendously
mind opening experience,

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:34.390 align:middle line:84%
followed by traveling in
Thailand and Cambodia and Laos.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And this was before they got
engulfed in the Vietnam War.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: So I
went back to Cambridge.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:43.910 align:middle line:84%
I had several more years there
doing research on plants.

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:46.230 align:middle line:84%
But I then came to a point
where I had to decide,

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:49.850 align:middle line:84%
do I want to go down a
regular academic track,

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:52.630 align:middle line:84%
leading to being a professor
and all that kind of thing,

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:56.040 align:middle line:84%
which I could have done,
or do something different?

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And I felt so drawn
to India and I

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:02.320 align:middle line:84%
felt so drawn to
working holistically

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.160 align:middle line:84%
with plants that
an opportunity came

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.350 align:middle line:84%
to work at a new
international institute

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:11.050 align:middle line:84%
starting in India for
agricultural research,

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:15.700 align:middle line:84%
called Icrisat, where I got
a job as the principal plant

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.040 align:middle line:90%
physiologist.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:22.330 align:middle line:84%
I then had, from then on,
about seven years in India,

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:27.190 align:middle line:84%
where I was working in the
fields on crop improvement,

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:30.160 align:middle line:84%
doing useful work with
Indian colleagues,

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.000 align:middle line:84%
mainly, but international
scientists as well.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Immersed in this totally
fascinating culture.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I have to say, just
a quick interjection here.

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I spent a little time in India
and I flew back into Heathrow.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.890 align:middle line:84%
But when I flew back
in after experiencing

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:53.200 align:middle line:84%
all the flavor and lushness and
sensuality and color and spices

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and flew back into a world where
the men were all wearing gray,

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.460 align:middle line:84%
gray, black, or navy blue,
and the women weren't

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:04.030 align:middle line:84%
a lot more colorful, it was
one of those real shocks

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:07.210 align:middle line:84%
as to what has happened
to us in Western culture.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, yes.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:09.020 align:middle line:90%
Well, I felt that.

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:12.350 align:middle line:84%
I felt here's this amazingly
exotic, colorful world, which

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:16.340 align:middle line:84%
is informed by a
sense of the spirit,

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.980 align:middle line:84%
with amazing
traditions, cultures,

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:24.770 align:middle line:84%
astonishing art, amazing
music, wonderful smells.

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:26.837 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just marvelous.

00:27:26.837 --> 00:27:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I can understand why
you went back for seven years.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: And I had
to job I loved doing,

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:36.110 align:middle line:84%
real science that
could be useful.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:39.020 align:middle line:84%
By that stage I'd come up,
while I was at Cambridge,

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.330 align:middle line:84%
with my idea about
morphogenetic fields

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:44.310 align:middle line:84%
and morphic resonance,
memory in nature,

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:48.260 align:middle line:84%
which was a very
heretical idea in science.

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't feel I could
publish it until I'd

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.540 align:middle line:90%
thought about it a lot more.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.080 align:middle line:84%
I knew it would be
very controversial.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.740 align:middle line:84%
So in India, working
on practical problems,

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:03.560 align:middle line:84%
was a way of stepping back,
continuing to think about this.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Still doing science
but not having

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:10.640 align:middle line:84%
to confront a kind
of clash of cultures

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.640 align:middle line:84%
when I wasn't ready
to do that, when

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.240 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't thought it through.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.800 align:middle line:84%
So in my spare
time I was thinking

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:19.010 align:middle line:84%
about morphogenetic
fields, form shaping

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:22.260 align:middle line:84%
fields, morphic resonance,
the memory in nature,

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:25.464 align:middle line:84%
inheritance through
morphic resonance,

00:28:25.464 --> 00:28:26.505 align:middle line:90%
as well as through genes.

00:28:26.505 --> 00:28:29.200 align:middle line:90%


00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And then in India, I was
also, at the same time,

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:34.450 align:middle line:84%
by then I'd taken up
transcendental meditation,

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:37.210 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to
explore consciousness.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Having gone through
a psychedelic phase

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:41.140 align:middle line:84%
at Cambridge, which
shocked me out

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:44.620 align:middle line:84%
of my complacency about the
mind being just the brain

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:47.380 align:middle line:84%
and there were dimensions
of consciousness

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:50.600 align:middle line:84%
no one had ever told me
about it in any tradition.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I hadn't
heard about this

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.410 align:middle line:90%
in regular Christian tradition.

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:57.490 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't heard about this
in the scientific tradition.

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:03.090 align:middle line:10%
The only guides were people
like Aldous Huxley, who'd had--

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:08.527 align:middle line:10%
his books on masculine and
the spiritual dimensions

00:29:08.527 --> 00:29:09.610 align:middle line:10%
of psychedelic experience.

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I suppose some
of the old Catholic mystics--

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:18.170 align:middle line:90%
Eckhart, Hildegard von Bingen--

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:22.120 align:middle line:84%
that had these experiences
and people still

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.170 align:middle line:84%
try to guess whether or not
they were plant induced or not.

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:27.970 align:middle line:84%
But other than that, there
was nothing in religion

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:32.304 align:middle line:84%
that led us to understand
these dimensions of experience.

00:29:32.304 --> 00:29:33.470 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, exactly.

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And in any case, at that
stage I was still more

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:37.990 align:middle line:84%
or less atheistic,
and I didn't know

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:40.060 align:middle line:84%
about the Christian
mystical tradition.

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:43.580 align:middle line:84%
No one had ever
told me about it.

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.790 align:middle line:84%
So I took up
transcendental meditation

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:48.640 align:middle line:84%
because I wanted to explore
consciousness without drugs.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And I found it a very
helpful practice.

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.322 align:middle line:84%
And the way it
was put across was

00:29:54.322 --> 00:29:55.780 align:middle line:84%
you don't need to
believe anything.

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Just try it and
see what happens.

00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:58.700 align:middle line:90%
That was fine.

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And I liked the
experimental approach.

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:03.190 align:middle line:90%


00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And I also went to visit
Hindu temples and ashrams

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.350 align:middle line:84%
and had got interested in
Hindu philosophy, which

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.780 align:middle line:84%
has consciousness is
primary and sees this

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.960 align:middle line:90%
as working through nature.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And I loved the fact they
had all these sacred trees

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.770 align:middle line:90%
and animals and things.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.620 align:middle line:84%
There was a sense that
life wasn't just machinery.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.160 align:middle line:90%


00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.770 align:middle line:84%
At that stage, when I
was living in Hyderabad,

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:33.050 align:middle line:84%
I was learning Urdu, because
that was the main lingua

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:35.840 align:middle line:90%
franca of Hyderabad.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was very friendly
with a Muslim family who

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.580 align:middle line:90%
I got on terribly well with.

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And the grandfather
of that family,

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:49.230 align:middle line:84%
a friend, his grandfather
was a Sufi teacher.

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And he had a big
influence on me.

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:58.110 align:middle line:84%
He was called [INAUDIBLE],,
and he spoke English.

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:00.390 align:middle line:10%
He wore wonderful brocade robes.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:02.790 align:middle line:10%
He was very aesthetic.

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.050 align:middle line:90%
He had perfumes.

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And men in that
culture wear perfumes.

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And when they get
together they're

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:10.980 align:middle line:84%
wearing these marvelous
robes, and they're

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:13.620 align:middle line:84%
smelling each other's
perfumes and stuff.

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:17.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I hadn't come across
anything like that before.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.900 align:middle line:90%
And these are religious people.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:23.160 align:middle line:84%
So pleasure was, in their view
of the world, given by God.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.940 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't sinful or bad to
have things that were beautiful

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:30.480 align:middle line:90%
or enjoy the pleasures of life.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.130 align:middle line:84%
They saw them as
gifts of God, and they

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:33.030 align:middle line:90%
were grateful for them.

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:34.571 align:middle line:84%
And I thought this
was much healthier

00:31:34.571 --> 00:31:39.990 align:middle line:84%
than the more puritanical
attitudes I was used to.

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, he gave me a
Sufi form of meditation,

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:44.850 align:middle line:90%
which I did for a year or so.

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And I found that
really helpful too.

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And I felt a connection
with the Islamic world

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.575 align:middle line:90%
which I hadn't had before.

00:31:52.575 --> 00:31:55.170 align:middle line:90%


00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:58.950 align:middle line:84%
But then as I continued
my exploration,

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:01.390 align:middle line:84%
this new thought
crossed my mind.

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:03.570 align:middle line:90%
What about Christianity?

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:06.950 align:middle line:84%
The one thing I had
not considered--

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Your
very original roots.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:09.720 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.890 align:middle line:90%
My original roots.

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:13.180 align:middle line:84%
I later discovered this
is a very common factor

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:14.790 align:middle line:90%
in our whole society today.

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:18.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's what I
call the ABC principle.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Anything But Christian.

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:22.280 align:middle line:90%
Buddhism Lite is fine.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:28.110 align:middle line:84%
A bit of a Native American
shamanism, Peruvian drumming,

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:29.790 align:middle line:90%
as long as it's not Christian.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Anyway I was in the ABC
mentality at the time.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
trying to reconnect

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.270 align:middle line:84%
with the Christian
tradition, and I found it

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:42.960 align:middle line:84%
really helpful to feel
in harmony with my roots

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.660 align:middle line:84%
and getting more into
contact with my ancestors

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and the tradition
from which I'd come.

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:51.720 align:middle line:84%
But I found that that
was still rather limited,

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't take into account
the great philosophical depths

00:32:55.830 --> 00:33:00.610 align:middle line:84%
of Hinduism or insights into
consciousness of Buddhism.

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:03.630 align:middle line:84%
I just went to regular
Anglican church services.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And I found I loved the
singing, I loved the music,

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:11.260 align:middle line:84%
I was used to it, but it didn't
have this mystical dimension.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.480 align:middle line:10%
And at that stage, a
friend introduced me

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:17.410 align:middle line:10%
to an English
Benedictine monk called

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:21.160 align:middle line:10%
Father Bede Griffiths, who lived
in an ashram in South India.

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.920 align:middle line:10%
I went to visit him.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And this was, for me, the
moment of great revelation.

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:28.905 align:middle line:84%
He didn't reject all
these Hindu and Buddhists

00:33:28.905 --> 00:33:30.120 align:middle line:90%
and he accepted them.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.410 align:middle line:84%
He thought they were great
insights into the nature

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:34.910 align:middle line:90%
of ultimate reality.

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:37.860 align:middle line:84%
But he also was very
aware of Meister Eckhart

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and the whole Christian
mystical tradition,

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:43.720 align:middle line:84%
which he told me about and
I'd never heard about before,

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.520 align:middle line:84%
and had produced a
kind of integration

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:52.320 align:middle line:84%
of these traditions, which was
just the perfect thing for me.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:56.150 align:middle line:84%
So when I came to write my
book on morphic resonance

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:58.291 align:middle line:84%
a couple of years
later, he said, well,

00:33:58.291 --> 00:34:00.290 align:middle line:84%
if you want to stay in
India to write your book,

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:03.250 align:middle line:84%
just come and live in the
ashram as long as you like.

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:04.050 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I spent two years in
this ashram writing my book,

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.644 align:middle line:84%
"A New Science of
Life," my first book.

00:34:10.644 --> 00:34:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's wonderful.

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:14.114 align:middle line:10%
And you had contact
with him the whole time?

00:34:14.114 --> 00:34:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: I
saw him every day.

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:15.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:15.929 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Every day.

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:16.909 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: I mean, it
was a small community.

00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:18.075 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What a privilege.

00:34:18.075 --> 00:34:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Hindu ashrams
in India were overwhelmed with

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:21.310 align:middle line:90%
Western visitors.

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:23.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Sai Baba
ashram, for example,

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.130 align:middle line:84%
would have like 1,000
Westerners at any given time.

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:27.754 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, The Beatles
had already done their thing.

00:34:27.754 --> 00:34:27.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:28.469 align:middle line:90%
Right

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:28.729 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:34:28.729 --> 00:34:29.529 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So yes.

00:34:29.529 --> 00:34:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: So the Hindu
ashrams were all crowded with

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.489 align:middle line:90%
spiritual tourists.

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:37.679 align:middle line:84%
Bus loads of Italians
arriving every day and things.

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:40.460 align:middle line:84%
But a Christian ashram,
because most people

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.949 align:middle line:84%
worked on the anything but
Christian principle, most

00:34:42.949 --> 00:34:44.929 align:middle line:84%
Westerners, the last
thing they thought of--

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:45.409 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Was peaceful.

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: --was going
to a Christian ashram.

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people there
were Indian Christians.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:54.365 align:middle line:84%
It was actually ironically more
Indian than the Indian ashrams,

00:34:54.365 --> 00:34:55.359 align:middle line:90%
the Hindu ashrams--

00:34:55.359 --> 00:34:56.317 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:34:56.317 --> 00:34:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: --and smaller
and much more peaceful.

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:02.690 align:middle line:84%
So at any given time there'd
only about 30 or 40 people

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:03.710 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:06.390 align:middle line:90%
And I saw Father Bede every day.

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And as I wrote my book, I
wrote it with a fountain pen

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:13.290 align:middle line:90%
in exercise books.

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And he read it
chapter by chapter,

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.760 align:middle line:84%
and we had long discussions
about everything.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What a
lovely collaboration.

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:21.449 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:35:21.449 --> 00:35:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: It was fantastic.

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:23.760 align:middle line:84%
Although he didn't
know much science,

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.210 align:middle line:90%
he knew a lot about philosophy.

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:26.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: And when I had
to explain the science to me,

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.660 align:middle line:84%
he'd say, Rupert, what
is a magnetic field,

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:33.830 align:middle line:90%
and how does it work?

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Then I had to give
these kind of tutorials

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:39.800 align:middle line:84%
to this great sage on
elementary science.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Very, very bright but he hadn't
had a scientific background.

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And this was wonderfully
good practice

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:48.290 align:middle line:84%
in explaining scientific
ideas to someone who

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:50.000 align:middle line:90%
was clever, but not scientific.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:50.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.316 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've said
off camera, you've

00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:53.960 align:middle line:84%
had to me what
sounds to me to be

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.940 align:middle line:90%
such a beautiful, charmed life.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And you've been able to
experience and indulge

00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:59.810 align:middle line:90%
in all of the things.

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Anywhere your curiosity
could take you,

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.030 align:middle line:84%
you've had just these exemplary
experiences, such as what

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:06.540 align:middle line:90%
you just spoke about.

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And now what I'd like to do
is after that, after you began

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:12.200 align:middle line:84%
expanding your own
base of awareness,

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.090 align:middle line:84%
after you went
back the ABC thing,

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:17.840 align:middle line:84%
went back and started
also expressing yourself

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:22.572 align:middle line:84%
through song and such through
your Anglican tradition,

00:36:22.572 --> 00:36:24.530 align:middle line:84%
you've moved forward to
a time where now you're

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:27.380 align:middle line:84%
blending the two in
this newest book, right?

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's fascinating
about it is because we're still

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:32.890 align:middle line:90%
in the ABC mode, big time.

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:35.148 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
let's do some stats.

00:36:35.148 --> 00:36:40.970 align:middle line:84%
We'll go from all this lush
imagery in India to some stats.

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about in your
book, today only 5% of Brits

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:46.592 align:middle line:90%
attend church regularly.

00:36:46.592 --> 00:36:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, you go through
every village,

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:51.560 align:middle line:84%
you have these wonderful
little churches and chapels,

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.090 align:middle line:84%
and you still have
the bells ringing

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:54.530 align:middle line:90%
but nobody's showing up.

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:55.610 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:57.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's for church itself.

00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:03.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the stats are
18% in formerly Catholic Irish

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Republic, 5% in France, and I
don't know that our viewership

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:11.600 align:middle line:84%
would be totally shocked to
find one of the higher rates

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.537 align:middle line:84%
of Christian attendance
in church is America.

00:37:14.537 --> 00:37:16.620 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Much higher
than anywhere in Europe,

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:17.480 align:middle line:90%
except Poland.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:23.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Europe is a
post-Christian block of nations

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:24.650 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:26.030 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And so with atheism and
science as the masters,

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:35.450 align:middle line:84%
as the, essentially,
rulers philosophically,

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:38.630 align:middle line:84%
there are some shifts that
have occurred in society

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:40.210 align:middle line:90%
that are significant.

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And there are some things
that have been lost.

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
matter whether it's

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Christianity or any
religion, I mean,

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:49.760 align:middle line:84%
really, it's the spiritual
principles we're talking about.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:52.970 align:middle line:84%
If they're not being employed
in the culture at large,

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:55.550 align:middle line:84%
you have an issue of
ethics and morality

00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:57.810 align:middle line:84%
and such that
starts taking a hit.

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, I think
what's happened, basically,

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:08.970 align:middle line:84%
is the ruling philosophy
of post-Christian Europe,

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:13.080 align:middle line:84%
is the ruling philosophy
has become secular humanism.

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And secular humanism
is quite interesting

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:18.410 align:middle line:84%
because it is a kind
of religion in itself.

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Although most secular humanists
would call themselves atheists,

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:26.370 align:middle line:84%
they don't believe
in the Christian God,

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:29.610 align:middle line:84%
but the structure of secular
humanism, and indeed,

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:33.480 align:middle line:84%
its morality, is very
similar to Christianity.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what they've
done is got rid of God

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:38.460 align:middle line:90%
and made humanity God.

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's like Christianity
where humans become divine.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's why secular
humanism in some ways

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:49.270 align:middle line:84%
is even more vigorous in its
assertions of human rights

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:54.140 align:middle line:84%
and, say, opposition
to the death penalty,

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:57.810 align:middle line:84%
including everyone,
previously rejected groups

00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:00.460 align:middle line:84%
like gays and
transsexuals, et cetera.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has to be included
because they're human.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.000 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:04.980 align:middle line:90%
Very inclusive.

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: It has
great strengths, I think.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.890 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see this
completely clearly

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:14.640 align:middle line:84%
until I read recently Yuval
Noah Hararos book "Homo

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Deus," which is a big
bestseller here in Britain.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.770 align:middle line:90%
Probably in America too.

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:21.420 align:middle line:84%
He makes it very
clear that that is

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:24.480 align:middle line:84%
the religion of
the modern secular

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:28.110 align:middle line:90%
world, secular humanism.

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Now if you take a really
thoroughgoing atheistic view

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.280 align:middle line:90%
it's deeply depressing.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.840 align:middle line:90%
Life is totally pointless.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.970 align:middle line:90%
Everything stops it death.

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:39.180 align:middle line:84%
The universe is purposeless
and has no meaning.

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:41.880 align:middle line:84%
There's no reason you
should be nice to anyone

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.300 align:middle line:84%
other than kind of just a
kind of social convention.

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:50.505 align:middle line:84%
We agree that I don't want
you to steal my things,

00:39:50.505 --> 00:39:53.280 align:middle line:84%
we don't want our things
stolen, so we get together

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:56.670 align:middle line:84%
to have police forces to
stop people stealing things.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:40:00.030 align:middle line:84%
But that's a kind of
minimalist morality.

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:02.430 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't say you could
go out of your way to help

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:03.760 align:middle line:90%
the poor and the downtrodden.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.434 align:middle line:84%
And that's the point
I'm trying to make here,

00:40:06.434 --> 00:40:09.000 align:middle line:84%
is that once families,
the family structure,

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.730 align:middle line:84%
started also shifting
dramatically after the 1960s.

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:15.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, divorce was
hugely on the rise.

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Many people, certainly the
millennials from single parent

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:22.170 align:middle line:84%
families and so forth,
and the dropping

00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:25.620 align:middle line:84%
away of the religions of
the world, so to speak,

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:29.190 align:middle line:84%
that is not a conscious
type of secular humanism.

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:31.140 align:middle line:84%
That's just a
dropping away of what

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:35.520 align:middle line:84%
was, with the majority of people
left with nothing in its place.

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.280 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's the thing, you see.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.810 align:middle line:84%
All religions provide a range
of spiritual practices--

00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: --which is
what I've been writing about.

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is one that's
in all traditions.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:52.260 align:middle line:84%
The Christian version
is contemplative prayer.

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:55.530 align:middle line:84%
But all have singing
and chanting.

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:58.030 align:middle line:84%
So you sing and chant
with other people.

00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And this has scientifically
proven effects

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:03.870 align:middle line:84%
on making you feel better,
more interconnected,

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:06.720 align:middle line:90%
lowering stress, and so forth.

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:10.470 align:middle line:84%
If you just go to church,
you get to sing just

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:11.370 align:middle line:90%
by going to church.

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:14.460 align:middle line:90%
It's just part of what you do.

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the
observation of festivals

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:19.740 align:middle line:84%
throughout the year, which gives
meaning to life and structure

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:21.210 align:middle line:90%
to community.

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the emphasis on
helping other people, which

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.370 align:middle line:90%
all religions encourage.

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:29.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about me
and me getting ahead.

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:32.190 align:middle line:90%
It's about helping others.

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:36.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a key part
of all religions.

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the, again, going

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:43.230 align:middle line:84%
to sacred places and the sense
of continuity and tradition

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:45.610 align:middle line:84%
and the sacrinization
of the Earth.

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:48.520 align:middle line:84%
In many traditions, including
the Christian tradition,

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:52.050 align:middle line:84%
there's pilgrimage, where
you go to holy places.

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:55.200 align:middle line:84%
Now if you opt out
of religion-- say

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.940 align:middle line:90%
I've left all that behind me.

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:58.920 align:middle line:90%
I rebelled against that.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.670 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think
they've outgrown it,

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:03.570 align:middle line:84%
or some people have had
really bad experiences,

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:04.920 align:middle line:90%
and that's more understandable.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Other people just
feel, oh, I'm so smart,

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't need all that.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.530 align:middle line:90%
I've seen through it.

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Stop doing it.

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Then you're left
much more isolated

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:17.890 align:middle line:84%
with none of these practices
as part of your life.

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And you can, of course, then
get them back, one by one.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.930 align:middle line:90%
But it's more effort.

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, many people have
a spiritual but not religious.

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:32.002 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, there's a
huge rise in spirituality.

00:42:32.002 --> 00:42:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes, that's it.

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And seeking for a
spiritual path of some kind,

00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:37.970 align:middle line:90%
yes, because of the void.

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE:
Because of this void.

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.526 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: So if you
stop following a traditional

00:42:41.526 --> 00:42:43.740 align:middle line:84%
religious path, which
many people have,

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:47.730 align:middle line:84%
even in the United States but
not so many as in Europe--

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:50.805 align:middle line:84%
Europe's sort of way ahead of
the US in this particular--

00:42:50.805 --> 00:42:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What about Italy?

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:54.332 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see any
numbers for Italy.

00:42:54.332 --> 00:42:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Do you know any off
the top of your head?

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.300 align:middle line:84%
It's about 15%
church attendance.

00:42:58.300 --> 00:42:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:00.175 align:middle line:90%
15%.

00:43:00.175 --> 00:43:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: I mean,
it's more than England,

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:04.370 align:middle line:90%
but still it's a minority.

00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: I mean, the
highest in Europe is Poland.

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.710 align:middle line:84%
It's the most religious
country in Europe.

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And as I recall,
is that in the 30s or 40s?

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: It's about 40%.

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: 40%.

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:15.565 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: The US
is about nearer 50%.

00:43:15.565 --> 00:43:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:18.469 align:middle line:90%
It's gone up since those stats.

00:43:18.469 --> 00:43:20.385 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, there
are different stats.

00:43:20.385 --> 00:43:22.550 align:middle line:90%
There's 45% to 50%.

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:23.410 align:middle line:90%
They vary, you know.

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:25.600 align:middle line:84%
None of these
stats are absolute.

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
it's on the rise.

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: I don't
know if it's on the rise.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.060 align:middle line:84%
I would say it's on the fall
in places like the Bay Area

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:31.860 align:middle line:90%
and New York.

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But not in what we
call the middle of the country,

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.070 align:middle line:84%
the Midwest, the red
states, so to speak.

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:44.200 align:middle line:84%
It's more on the rise it appears
now, especially fundamentalism.

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: But for people
who've given up regular

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:49.130 align:middle line:84%
religious practice of
the ancestral kind,

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:52.530 align:middle line:84%
ones that the family had-- and
this mainly means Christians,

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:57.880 align:middle line:84%
because you don't meet many
atheist or agnostic Hindus,

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.540 align:middle line:90%
Buddhists, or Muslims.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Christianity is the religion
that most, on the largest

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:06.120 align:middle line:90%
scale, has led to atheism.

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: So almost
all atheists are Jewish

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:14.910 align:middle line:84%
or Christian, principally
Christian, by background.

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:18.240 align:middle line:84%
So having moved away
from that, then there's

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.700 align:middle line:90%
a spiritual hunger and need.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's why there's
an enormous interest

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:27.360 align:middle line:84%
in spirituality
today of all sorts,

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:30.000 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
basic human desire.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.610 align:middle line:84%
We need to feel
connected with something

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:36.030 align:middle line:84%
larger than ourselves, which is
what spirituality is all about.

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And you've done a
beautiful job chronicling

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:39.930 align:middle line:90%
each of these needs.

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And you go into
them in some detail.

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And what I like
about the book too,

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.540 align:middle line:84%
is you have a little
practices that people can

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.160 align:middle line:90%
do at the end of the chapters.

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.500 align:middle line:90%
And I just wanted to put one--

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:51.090 align:middle line:90%
just add one comment in here.

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:52.740 align:middle line:90%
I'll read from your book.

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:57.660 align:middle line:10%
And this was a comment by Alain
de Botton, the philosopher,

00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:59.160 align:middle line:10%
who was a former atheist.

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.600 align:middle line:90%
And he came to a conclusion.

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And this was what
the statement was,

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:06.210 align:middle line:84%
that "we've grown frightened
of the word morality.

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:08.220 align:middle line:84%
We bridle at the thought
of hearing a sermon.

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:11.310 align:middle line:84%
We flee from the idea that
art should be uplifting

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:13.110 align:middle line:90%
or have ethical mission.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:14.880 align:middle line:90%
We don't go on pilgrimages.

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.080 align:middle line:90%
We can't build temples.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:19.800 align:middle line:84%
We have no mechanism for
expressing gratitude."

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.382 align:middle line:84%
Which essentially
your book covered

00:45:21.382 --> 00:45:23.340 align:middle line:84%
every one of those things
that he talked about.

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:25.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, exactly.

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:27.300 align:middle line:90%
Well, he's still an atheist.

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:32.560 align:middle line:84%
But he wrote that in a book
called "Religion for Atheists,"

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.390 align:middle line:84%
where he's trying to reinvent
religion for atheists.

00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:38.020 align:middle line:84%
He's started atheist
sermons in London,

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:44.490 align:middle line:84%
for example, which what he says
is a sermon is a talk designed

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:45.910 align:middle line:90%
to help you lead a better life.

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:46.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:48.084 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: In
a secular world,

00:45:48.084 --> 00:45:50.280 align:middle line:90%
all you have is information.

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:52.280 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell people
how to lead a better

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:54.880 align:middle line:84%
life because you're
interfering with their freedom.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:58.200 align:middle line:84%
So secular societies have
nothing like a sermon.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.867 align:middle line:90%
So he's re-instituted sermons--

00:45:59.867 --> 00:46:00.825 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:46:00.825 --> 00:46:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: --about how
to lead a better life.

00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is he part
of the Sunday Assembly?

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: No, but he's very
close in spirit to the Sunday

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:09.585 align:middle line:90%
Assembly.

00:46:09.585 --> 00:46:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because the Sunday
Assembly is a group of atheists

00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:12.410 align:middle line:90%
that essentially--

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:15.070 align:middle line:84%
I think their motto is "Live
better, help often, wonder

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:15.870 align:middle line:90%
more."

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, they've sort of
invented an atheist church.

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: And they've
got over 70 branches.

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And they meet on Sunday
morning, sing together,

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.570 align:middle line:90%
have uplifting stories.

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, they don't like
being called an atheist church

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:30.900 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.720 align:middle line:84%
They prefer to be called
mystical humanists.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:37.380 align:middle line:84%
They're reinventing
a kind of something

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:39.230 align:middle line:90%
beyond themselves, really.

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:41.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's fascinating.

00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, we talk about what-- let's
talk about some of the things--

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:46.290 align:middle line:84%
we have a little
time left here, so we

00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:48.990 align:middle line:84%
can get into some of the
principles you talk about.

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And one of them, of course,
is prayer, meditation.

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And you say, when
we're participating

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:57.090 align:middle line:84%
in a prayer or meditation,
we have two kinds--

00:46:57.090 --> 00:47:00.930 align:middle line:84%
intentions and
requests or letting go.

00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about the
value of each of those.

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.640 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, I make
a distinction between prayer

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.250 align:middle line:90%
and meditation.

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:12.139 align:middle line:84%
And by prayer, I'm talking about
petitionary prayer, the kind

00:47:12.139 --> 00:47:13.180 align:middle line:90%
that's asking for things.

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Please,
please, please.

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.710 align:middle line:84%
So I see the difference
between these two

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:21.770 align:middle line:84%
as like the difference between
breathing out and breathing in.

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:24.620 align:middle line:84%
I think they're both important,
but they're quite different.

00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:25.890 align:middle line:90%
And I do both myself.

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:29.300 align:middle line:84%
I meditate in the mornings
and I pray in the evenings.

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, in meditation, what
you're doing is usually closing

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:35.930 align:middle line:84%
your eyes, withdrawing from
the concerns of the world,

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:36.930 align:middle line:90%
you're in a quiet place.

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:39.500 align:middle line:90%


00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And then through a
mantra or through

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:45.960 align:middle line:84%
a mindfulness technique,
allowing the stream of thought

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:50.250 align:middle line:84%
to carry on but try and detach
from it by going to the mantra

00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:52.830 align:middle line:84%
or to the awareness
of the breathing.

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And so the thoughts
continue, like clouds

00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:56.940 align:middle line:84%
going through the
sky, but you're not

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.290 align:middle line:90%
as involved with them.

00:47:58.290 --> 00:47:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they
stop, and then you

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:05.280 align:middle line:84%
are in a period of mindfulness
or open consciousness, which

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:09.510 align:middle line:84%
is no longer about thoughts,
worries, preoccupations,

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:11.340 align:middle line:90%
ruminations.

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're
doing there is trying

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:16.530 align:middle line:84%
to let go of thoughts
and your regular concerns

00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:18.600 align:middle line:84%
and your regular
involvements with the world

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:21.060 align:middle line:84%
and detach yourself
from it to go

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:24.030 align:middle line:84%
to the very ground of
consciousness itself,

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:28.380 align:middle line:84%
which turns out to be
enormously relaxing, connecting,

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:30.280 align:middle line:90%
and powerfully healthy.

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Indeed.

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And you can have incredible
breakthrough insights

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.170 align:middle line:90%
from that place.

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Exactly.

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.813 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: When the mind is
completely still and relaxed

00:48:36.813 --> 00:48:38.340 align:middle line:90%
and unperturbed.

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Exactly.

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:40.650 align:middle line:90%
But it comes by itself.

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:41.040 align:middle line:90%
You can't--

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:41.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:42.273 align:middle line:90%
You cannot force it.

00:48:42.273 --> 00:48:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: However hard
you try, you can't force it.

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, petitionary prayer,
asking for things,

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:49.900 align:middle line:84%
it works in exactly
the opposite direction.

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:52.680 align:middle line:84%
That's like withdrawing from
the outer world coming in,

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.410 align:middle line:90%
like breathing in.

00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:57.720 align:middle line:84%
In petitionary prayer, you
start by making a connection

00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:01.380 align:middle line:90%
with a spiritual realm or being.

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Petitionary prayers
start with an invocation,

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.090 align:middle line:84%
"Our Father, who art in Heaven,"
"Hail Mary, full of grace,"

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:12.990 align:middle line:90%
[HINDU] for a Hindu invocation.

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:17.880 align:middle line:84%
You start by invoking the
being to which you're praying.

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:20.400 align:middle line:84%
So you connect with
the spiritual realm,

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and then you link it to
what you're concerned

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.330 align:middle line:90%
about in the outer world.

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Someone who's sick that
you're praying for.

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Something you are frightened
of that you want help with.

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Something that you want a
sense of purpose or meaning

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:35.720 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.130 align:middle line:84%
You want the grace to be
able to forgive somebody.

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you are asking for, for
other people or for yourself,

00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:44.940 align:middle line:84%
is connecting the
spiritual realm

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.980 align:middle line:84%
with the concerns of
your everyday life.

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the
opposite direction.

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:51.360 align:middle line:84%
It's from the spirit
outwards, and the other's

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:52.831 align:middle line:90%
from outwards to the spirit.

00:49:52.831 --> 00:49:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And for you, the
balance of the two is what

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:56.340 align:middle line:90%
works best?

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:59.280 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes, because I
think just meditation, you see,

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:02.710 align:middle line:84%
leaves unaddressed the
concerns of everyday life.

00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:03.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Each of us,
by the end of the day,

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:07.784 align:middle line:84%
I've got things that
I want to pray about,

00:50:07.784 --> 00:50:08.700 align:middle line:90%
about what's happened.

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:10.900 align:middle line:84%
I want to give thanks for
things that have happened.

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:12.974 align:middle line:84%
I want to pray for people
I know who are sick

00:50:12.974 --> 00:50:13.890 align:middle line:90%
or who are in trouble.

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's another big one
we're going to go to next,

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:16.790 align:middle line:90%
is gratitude.

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:19.123 align:middle line:84%
But before we do, I wanted
to say, you share in the book

00:50:19.123 --> 00:50:21.240 align:middle line:84%
that dozens of
members of parliament

00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.930 align:middle line:90%
have begun meditating.

00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:24.609 align:middle line:90%
There's over 100.

00:50:24.609 --> 00:50:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I think that's
absolutely fascinating.

00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:29.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if there were ever
a stressful, left-brained

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:30.870 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:32.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's wonderful.

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:34.590 align:middle line:90%
How was that spearheaded?

00:50:34.590 --> 00:50:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, there are
people who teach meditation who

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:41.220 align:middle line:84%
hit on the idea of inviting
members of Parliament to go

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:44.829 align:middle line:84%
to meditation courses or classes
in the houses of Parliament.

00:50:44.829 --> 00:50:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's lovely.

00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:48.328 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: And then having
a regular group meeting where

00:50:48.328 --> 00:50:50.380 align:middle line:84%
they can go and
meditate together.

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Maybe they'll find
higher purpose in their work

00:50:52.110 --> 00:50:52.860 align:middle line:90%
that way too.

00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well,
they may well.

00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:55.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they'd
certainly find a relief

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:57.750 align:middle line:84%
from the stress and
a kind of window

00:50:57.750 --> 00:51:01.100 align:middle line:90%
into a more calm state of being.

00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:04.800 align:middle line:84%
A calm state of being where you
can make decisions in a clear

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.000 align:middle line:90%
headed state too.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:08.853 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then, also, the
National Health Service here is

00:51:08.853 --> 00:51:10.360 align:middle line:90%
now recommending meditation.

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's going to
keep the budget intact

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:15.354 align:middle line:84%
if you have people
remaining calm and healthy.

00:51:15.354 --> 00:51:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, exactly.

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:19.700 align:middle line:84%
It's mainly recommended for
people with mild to moderate

00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:20.500 align:middle line:90%
depression.

00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is a huge problem here
as it is in the United States.

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:25.780 align:middle line:90%
Depression is endemic.

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: And I don't think
it's surprising it's endemic

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:31.960 align:middle line:84%
in a society where people
feel isolated and think

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:35.040 align:middle line:84%
they're leading pointless
lives in a pointless world.

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:39.640 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a modern disease.

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that meditation can

00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:44.790 align:middle line:84%
be as effective, if not
more effective and certainly

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:47.880 align:middle line:84%
cheaper, than
antidepressants like Prozac.

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:51:48.690 --> 00:51:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: So this is now--

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:51.930 align:middle line:84%
they actually did
clinical trials,

00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:54.870 align:middle line:84%
comparing meditation
with antidepressants,

00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:57.270 align:middle line:90%
to see which worked best.

00:51:57.270 --> 00:52:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And in many ways, the
meditation worked better.

00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And of course, has
fewer side effects.

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:04.530 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about-- let's
move on to gratitude.

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
I love in the book

00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:12.930 align:middle line:84%
is you talk about,
let's start with some

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:16.770 align:middle line:84%
of the really essential elements
of life, like the sun itself.

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:18.960 align:middle line:84%
How many cultures, how
many people-- the Brits,

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:22.020 align:middle line:90%
in particular, worship the sun.

00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And the notion of something
brilliant and life

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:27.150 align:middle line:90%
giving and multi-dimensional.

00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:31.560 align:middle line:84%
So that's where we can begin
gratitude on a daily basis.

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:35.235 align:middle line:84%
And from there, your
practice of gratitude.

00:52:35.235 --> 00:52:37.200 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, mine
has different levels.

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:41.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, part of
it is the simplest

00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:44.850 align:middle line:84%
and most straightforward form of
gratitude are for other people,

00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:48.180 align:middle line:84%
because we all depend
on other people.

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And then as we move out from the
other people on whom we depend,

00:52:51.690 --> 00:52:55.890 align:middle line:84%
people who grow our
food, bring it to us,

00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:58.680 align:middle line:84%
help us in our lives--
doctors, dentists,

00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:03.270 align:middle line:84%
bus drivers, maintenance
engineers, teachers.

00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:07.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so many
people we depend on.

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:08.070 align:middle line:90%
That's one level.

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the
ecology that gives rise

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:13.335 align:middle line:84%
to the food and our life and
the Earth, the whole Earth

00:53:13.335 --> 00:53:15.970 align:middle line:90%
on which all of us depend.

00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we
take it for granted,

00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:21.070 align:middle line:90%
then we run into real danger.

00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:23.170 align:middle line:84%
The ecological crisis
is based on just

00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:24.520 align:middle line:90%
taking the Earth for granted.

00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:25.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: We take
but we don't give,

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:30.250 align:middle line:90%
even don't give thanks.

00:53:30.250 --> 00:53:32.620 align:middle line:84%
But then the sun,
you see, the Earth

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:35.950 align:middle line:84%
itself is part of a much larger
system, the solar system,

00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:37.440 align:middle line:90%
and that's part of the galaxy.

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:43.750 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, the sun, if the
sun sends out a coronal mass

00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:45.520 align:middle line:84%
ejection pointed
towards the Earth,

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:48.790 align:middle line:84%
it could take out all
our communication systems

00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:50.540 align:middle line:90%
in no time at all.

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And so we take for
granted the sun.

00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And the sun is like
a living organism.

00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.990 align:middle line:90%
It has constant activity.

00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:02.140 align:middle line:84%
That's why NASA
has a space weather

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:06.160 align:middle line:84%
forecast, because the sun's
activity affects life on Earth.

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:09.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a standard
emitter like a light bulb or--

00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE:
--uniform radiation.

00:54:11.350 --> 00:54:13.849 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it's always been
believed by ancient cultures

00:54:13.849 --> 00:54:19.720 align:middle line:84%
to have its own intelligence of
a vast multi-dimensional nature

00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:21.984 align:middle line:84%
that it's sharing
and perpetuating.

00:54:21.984 --> 00:54:23.150 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, exactly.

00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:25.060 align:middle line:90%
And I learned this--

00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:27.340 align:middle line:84%
well, I never learned it
from anyone in England.

00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:30.910 align:middle line:84%
But when I was in India,
when I learned yoga,

00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:34.170 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that I
learned was Surya Namaskar,

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:35.660 align:middle line:90%
prostration to the sun.

00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:37.600 align:middle line:10%
It's a basic yoga exercise.

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:40.860 align:middle line:10%
I've done it every day
for more than 40 years.

00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:42.820 align:middle line:10%
I did it this morning
when I got up.

00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:45.820 align:middle line:10%
And that's an
acknowledgement to the sun.

00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:48.590 align:middle line:10%
On one level, it's a
really good exercise.

00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Another level,
you're facing the sun

00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:53.740 align:middle line:84%
or facing a window where
the sunlight is coming in

00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and acknowledging the sun on
which all our lives depend.

00:54:57.790 --> 00:54:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Another Hindu
practice is one of the most

00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:05.320 align:middle line:84%
common of all their mantras,
is the Gaia Tree Mantra,

00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:08.610 align:middle line:84%
which is a mantra which
asks the sun to illuminate

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:12.310 align:middle line:84%
our meditation, the glorious
divine splendor of the sun

00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:13.620 align:middle line:90%
to illuminate our meditation.

00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:16.334 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:55:16.334 --> 00:55:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really glad
you wrote about that

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.190 align:middle line:84%
because that's something
that's been fairly lost

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:21.720 align:middle line:90%
in Western culture.

00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about beauty
for beauty's sake too.

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:27.960 align:middle line:84%
This is something I
feel very strongly.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:31.502 align:middle line:84%
About our sense
of innate beauty,

00:55:31.502 --> 00:55:33.960 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter which of the
senses it's running through,

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:39.780 align:middle line:84%
has been fairly well obscured
as a result of using devices.

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:43.030 align:middle line:84%
We're not connected with the
sensual world as much anymore.

00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:45.370 align:middle line:84%
We've had so much fun
talking to this point.

00:55:45.370 --> 00:55:48.030 align:middle line:84%
So let's for a moment
just address the nature

00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:50.489 align:middle line:84%
the nature of beauty
itself for beauty's sake.

00:55:50.489 --> 00:55:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: I think when
we think about beauty,

00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:56.130 align:middle line:84%
the first idea that most people
have is it's just in our minds

00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:58.260 align:middle line:90%
and it's not really out there.

00:55:58.260 --> 00:55:59.340 align:middle line:90%
It's just in our minds.

00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:01.740 align:middle line:84%
But if you think
about it, it soon

00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:04.290 align:middle line:84%
becomes clear that it's
much more than that.

00:56:04.290 --> 00:56:06.240 align:middle line:90%
Animals have a sense of beauty.

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:08.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think of
a peacock's tail,

00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:10.080 align:middle line:90%
think of a butterfly's wing.

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:11.700 align:middle line:90%
Why are they so beautiful?

00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:13.440 align:middle line:84%
That's because
they are to attract

00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:15.350 align:middle line:90%
other members of the species.

00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:18.270 align:middle line:84%
They have a function, "the
beauty of sexual selection,"

00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:19.590 align:middle line:90%
as Darwin said.

00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:23.730 align:middle line:84%
But they wouldn't work unless
they had a sense of beauty.

00:56:23.730 --> 00:56:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And flowers are some of the
most beautiful things on Earth.

00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And again, as Darwin
said, "Before there

00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:32.970 align:middle line:84%
was an eye to see it there
could have been no flower."

00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:35.130 align:middle line:84%
There are interactions
between the plant

00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:36.960 align:middle line:90%
kingdom and the animal kingdom.

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.820 align:middle line:84%
But they were there
70 million years ago,

00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:42.810 align:middle line:90%
long before any humans appeared.

00:56:42.810 --> 00:56:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was insect eyes that were
seeing the flowers, butterflies

00:56:46.650 --> 00:56:48.440 align:middle line:90%
and bees primarily.

00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:51.030 align:middle line:84%
They've evolved in
relation to insects.

00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And unless those insects
had a sense of beauty

00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:55.800 align:middle line:90%
with brains tiny--

00:56:55.800 --> 00:57:00.570 align:middle line:84%
really tiny brains, much,
much smaller than ours--

00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:03.330 align:middle line:84%
an exquisite sense
of beauty that

00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:06.980 align:middle line:84%
has driven the
evolution of flies,

00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:09.030 align:middle line:84%
then this shows that
a sense of beauty

00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:13.050 align:middle line:84%
is inherent in almost
anything, even in plants.

00:57:13.050 --> 00:57:16.050 align:middle line:84%
Fern leaves, for example, are
extraordinarily beautiful,

00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:18.450 align:middle line:84%
and that's nothing to do
with attracting insects.

00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:21.090 align:middle line:84%
It's just somehow
in nature itself.

00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:23.790 align:middle line:84%
There's hardly anything
ugly in nature itself.

00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:26.744 align:middle line:84%
Most ugly things we
see are man made.

00:57:26.744 --> 00:57:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And yet we have cut
ourselves off from a lot

00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:32.380 align:middle line:84%
of the innate beauty
surrounding us.

00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:36.270 align:middle line:84%
We walk right by a beautiful
rose on the walkway,

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:37.330 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:40.480 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
I have a hard time with,

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:44.070 align:middle line:84%
is seeing the dismissal of
beauty on all its levels.

00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And so thank you for
sharing that perspective

00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:49.000 align:middle line:84%
from the animal
and insect kingdom.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to the notion of
joining together as community.

00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And you do so in
your Anglican church.

00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And singing together and
what this does to the body,

00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:01.420 align:middle line:84%
because it actually
improves our immune systems.

00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:03.750 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
chanting and singing.

00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:06.083 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, this is
something I've learned a lot

00:58:06.083 --> 00:58:09.540 align:middle line:84%
about my wife, Jill Purce, who
teaches chanting and singing.

00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:12.840 align:middle line:90%
Also, through singing myself.

00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:16.620 align:middle line:84%
When we chant or sing together,
we make notes together.

00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:18.870 align:middle line:84%
If we're chanting or
singing, we breathe together.

00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:22.530 align:middle line:84%
We literally come into
resonance with each other.

00:58:22.530 --> 00:58:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And if we're chanting or singing
mantras or standard prayers

00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:29.580 align:middle line:84%
or even regular
hymns, there's also

00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:32.310 align:middle line:84%
a resonance by what I call
morphic resonance with those

00:58:32.310 --> 00:58:33.760 align:middle line:90%
who've done it before.

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:35.340 align:middle line:90%
So it's deeply connecting.

00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:37.230 align:middle line:84%
It connects us
with our own bodies

00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:40.770 align:middle line:84%
because the words make
our bodies vibrate.

00:58:40.770 --> 00:58:42.932 align:middle line:84%
It connects us
with other people,

00:58:42.932 --> 00:58:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and it connects us
with a whole tradition

00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:46.440 align:middle line:90%
of those who've done it before.

00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:49.630 align:middle line:84%
So it overcomes that
terrible isolation

00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:52.620 align:middle line:84%
that we fall into if
we cut ourselves off

00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:56.130 align:middle line:84%
from nature and from each
other and reconnects us.

00:58:56.130 --> 00:58:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it's vibrating
inside our brains and inside

00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:02.260 align:middle line:84%
our bodies, healing us on a
very vibrational physical level.

00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Literally.

00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:05.292 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How many of
us ever sing anymore?

00:59:05.292 --> 00:59:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Unless you happen
to hear something

00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:09.640 align:middle line:84%
in passing on the radio
that you know the lyrics to.

00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes.

00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:12.481 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I mean, I
really feel this myself.

00:59:12.481 --> 00:59:14.970 align:middle line:84%
I stopped singing
for a long time other

00:59:14.970 --> 00:59:16.170 align:middle line:90%
than the occasional song.

00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And I've just been feeling
in the last year or two

00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:22.410 align:middle line:84%
that something is really
missing on a vibrational level.

00:59:22.410 --> 00:59:25.350 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's chanting,
whether it's spiritual,

00:59:25.350 --> 00:59:28.440 align:middle line:84%
whether it's for joy, we
just need to sing again.

00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And we can't go through
all of the points

00:59:31.110 --> 00:59:33.690 align:middle line:84%
because they're in your book
and very well delineated,

00:59:33.690 --> 00:59:36.990 align:middle line:84%
but I would like to go to
pilgrimage and the beauty

00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:41.520 align:middle line:84%
and value of pilgrimage and your
pilgrimages with your godson.

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, pilgrimage
is very ancient human thing.

00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:46.120 align:middle line:90%
All religions have it.

00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Our hunter gatherer ancestors
moved around the landscape.

00:59:49.330 --> 00:59:50.850 align:middle line:90%
They were nomadic.

00:59:50.850 --> 00:59:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And pilgrimage is like a residue
of our nomadic tradition.

00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:59.220 align:middle line:84%
I think it's deep and archetypal
to go to sacred places,

00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:02.460 align:middle line:84%
to reconnect with
those holy places.

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:05.100 align:middle line:84%
The Protestant Reformation
abolished pilgrimage

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:09.060 align:middle line:84%
in northern Europe, and the
settlers of North America

01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:12.750 align:middle line:84%
didn't have it because they were
Protestants for the most part.

01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:15.940 align:middle line:84%
The ones in South America,
the Catholics, included it.

01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:18.330 align:middle line:84%
They just took over the
ancient sacred places

01:00:18.330 --> 01:00:19.860 align:middle line:90%
and made them Christian.

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:23.820 align:middle line:84%
So there are massive
pilgrimages in Catholic Central

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and South America, for example,
to the shrine of Our Lady

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:30.870 align:middle line:90%
of Guadalupe in Mexico.

01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:34.670 align:middle line:84%
So I've been doing this
every year with my godson.

01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:36.480 align:middle line:90%
We have a one day pilgrimage.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:40.080 align:middle line:84%
We walk the last eight
or nine miles towards one

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:44.070 align:middle line:84%
of the great cathedrals of
England, Canterbury, Lincoln,

01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Wells, and what was
the other one we did?

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.040 align:middle line:90%
Oh, Ely.

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And this year, probably we're
going to go to Winchester.

01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, it's beautiful.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:55.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:00:55.770 --> 01:00:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: So we walk
through the countryside,

01:00:57.330 --> 01:00:59.730 align:middle line:84%
connecting with the
countryside and each other,

01:00:59.730 --> 01:01:02.530 align:middle line:90%
relating to that holy place.

01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:04.410 align:middle line:84%
When we get there,
we go with intention.

01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:07.300 align:middle line:84%
We light a candle
and say a prayer.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Then we have a cream
tea, which refreshes us.

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And then we go to
choral evensong

01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:17.670 align:middle line:84%
every day in all our cathedrals
on weekdays, not just Sundays.

01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:19.920 align:middle line:84%
There's this beautiful
evening service

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:24.480 align:middle line:84%
in 16th century language sung
by wonderful choirs, called

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.400 align:middle line:90%
choral evensong.

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.080 align:middle line:84%
So we go to choral
evensong, which

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:31.497 align:middle line:84%
is inspiring, uplifting,
incredibly beautiful.

01:01:31.497 --> 01:01:33.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is that in
all Anglican churches?

01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Yes.

01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:36.870 align:middle line:84%
In London, Westminster Abbey
and St. Paul's Cathedral

01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:38.845 align:middle line:90%
almost every day, 5:00 PM.

01:01:38.845 --> 01:01:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'll have
to go and hear it.

01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:44.460 align:middle line:10%
>> SHELDRAKE: There's a website,
called choralevensong.org,

01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:46.650 align:middle line:10%
which I've helped set up.

01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:50.460 align:middle line:84%
Which means you can find it
anywhere in Britain or Ireland

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:52.284 align:middle line:90%
any day.

01:01:52.284 --> 01:01:54.450 align:middle line:84%
So you can check it out
while you're here in London.

01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:55.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, I
will check it out.

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Westminster Abbey.

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:56.841 align:middle line:90%
It's in walking distance.

01:01:56.841 --> 01:01:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, it is.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:01:59.640 align:middle line:90%
Any final thoughts?

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:02.630 align:middle line:84%
We only have about
one minute left?

01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>> SHELDRAKE: Well, the
main thing is that all these

01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:08.535 align:middle line:84%
practices that I write
about are open to everyone.

01:02:08.535 --> 01:02:10.160 align:middle line:90%
They're inclusive.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
things where you have

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:15.710 align:middle line:84%
to start by believing or
signing up to something.

01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:18.320 align:middle line:84%
They're all based
on experience first.

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.720 align:middle line:90%
Practice leading to experience.

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.970 align:middle line:10%
And I myself think the
root of all religions

01:02:22.970 --> 01:02:25.370 align:middle line:10%
is an experience,
first and foremost.

01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:27.830 align:middle line:10%
The doctrines come along later.

01:02:27.830 --> 01:02:30.810 align:middle line:10%
But all the great religions
start from direct experience.

01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:33.130 align:middle line:10%
Buddha's enlightenment
under a tree;

01:02:33.130 --> 01:02:37.680 align:middle line:10%
Jesus' experience of being a
direct connection with God;

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:40.250 align:middle line:10%
Muhammad's experience
of the voice

01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:43.250 align:middle line:10%
of God speaking through him.

01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:45.650 align:middle line:10%
They all start with experience.

01:02:45.650 --> 01:02:48.380 align:middle line:10%
And that, I think,
is the starting point

01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:49.790 align:middle line:10%
for all spiritual life.

01:02:49.790 --> 01:02:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think that by looking
at the spiritual experiences,

01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:56.130 align:middle line:84%
which are part of all
religious traditions,

01:02:56.130 --> 01:02:59.420 align:middle line:84%
we can reconnect
through our own practice

01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:01.830 align:middle line:90%
through these experiences.

01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And we can then either continue
to do them just individually,

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.550 align:middle line:84%
or we can join together
with other people, which is

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:09.860 align:middle line:90%
in itself a spiritual practice.

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Indeed.

01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:13.820 align:middle line:84%
There is a part of us that
has this innate connection

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:17.570 align:middle line:84%
to the all, the great mystery,
and when we cut ourselves off

01:03:17.570 --> 01:03:20.769 align:middle line:84%
from it, you can't help but
feel just a little bit grayer.

01:03:20.769 --> 01:03:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>> SHELDRAKE: Definitely.

01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:22.760 align:middle line:90%
And more depressed.

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And a
little more depressed.

01:03:23.810 --> 01:03:24.830 align:middle line:90%
And that's been proven.

01:03:24.830 --> 01:03:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And your book is helping
people find their way

01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:29.490 align:middle line:84%
back to something
that works for them.

01:03:29.490 --> 01:03:31.371 align:middle line:90%
It's not dogmatic in any way.

01:03:31.371 --> 01:03:33.620 align:middle line:84%
It's finding your way to the
things that work for you,

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:35.660 align:middle line:84%
like singing, and
gratitude, and love,

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:38.300 align:middle line:84%
and appreciation, which
we can all benefit from.

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you so much
for taking time with us

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:42.800 align:middle line:84%
