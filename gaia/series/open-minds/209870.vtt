>>REGINA MEREDITH:
I'm always so excited.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.250 align:middle line:84%
What are they going
to show me next?

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.160 align:middle line:84%
What kind of ancient
history or secrets

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.240 align:middle line:90%
are they going to share?

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I asked his higher
consciousness why

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.930 align:middle line:90%
did you show him this lifetime?

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And they said
because we wanted him

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.880 align:middle line:84%
to remember that he was
part of the team that

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.410 align:middle line:90%
developed the human.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Any time you feel
a strong emotion,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.290 align:middle line:84%
any time, always,
it opens up portals.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.660 align:middle line:90%
Why did the White man do this?

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.140 align:middle line:84%
He said, the White man was
one of the earliest victims

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.810 align:middle line:84%
of this negative energy
that asserted itself

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.070 align:middle line:90%
onto the planet.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.950 align:middle line:90%
He's a passive version of her.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And he could communicate to
me, almost like a phone call.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.400 align:middle line:90%
So this is where it gets crazy.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.740 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
my phone pinged.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't why I kept describing
the Americas as very advanced.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And they would speak with ETs
and interdimensional beings

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.260 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.379 align:middle line:84%
And all that evidence
has been removed.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.930 align:middle line:10%
They usually have the
same message, which is--

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.350 align:middle line:10%

>>REGINA: Sarah Breskman
Cosme is back with us

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.970 align:middle line:10%
and has fascinating
information to share

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.630 align:middle line:10%
on the history of the ancient
Americas and Native Americans.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.020 align:middle line:10%
The timeline stretches back
to Atlantis and Lemuria

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.950 align:middle line:10%
and reaches to the sky.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.330 align:middle line:84%
We'll discuss a witness
account of the Trail of Tears

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.460 align:middle line:84%
when the Native
American population

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.960 align:middle line:90%
were moved from their lands.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.190 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Sarah.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.440 align:middle line:84%
It's always so good to
see your beautiful face

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.730 align:middle line:84%
and hear fascinating information
because you're like Dolores.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.870 align:middle line:90%
You don't stop.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.542 align:middle line:84%
You're the energizer
bunny of regressions.

00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SARAH COSME: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.752 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited to be here.

00:01:45.752 --> 00:01:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I know
Dolores is working

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.240 align:middle line:90%
with you from the other side.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And so you got a lot of
good support around you.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And you're developing an
incredible body of work

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.020 align:middle line:84%
that you've now been
documenting in one,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.637 align:middle line:84%
really, one wonderful
book after another.

00:02:00.637 --> 00:02:02.220 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
thank you for taking

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.110 align:middle line:84%
the time as she did to
document everything,

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.610 align:middle line:90%
so we have these stories.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.092 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Thank you so much.

00:02:08.092 --> 00:02:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It seems to me
because history is not

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.090 align:middle line:84%
going to be figured
out by looking

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.710 align:middle line:84%
at the accepted
historical accounts

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.590 align:middle line:84%
that we'll find in libraries
and in universities

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.015 align:middle line:90%
educational systems.

00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:23.130 align:middle line:84%
That's a bit that
tells a little bit,

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.410 align:middle line:84%
but it's really going
to be brought forward

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:90%
by those who were there.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.710 align:middle line:10%
And can bring, clearly, bring
back the memory as clearly

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.510 align:middle line:10%
as possible.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And together, we're going to
piece together our history.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.580 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: I mean, it's so
exciting the work I do.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm always so excited.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.250 align:middle line:84%
What are they going
to show me next?

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.310 align:middle line:84%
What kind of ancient history
are they going to share with me?

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.440 align:middle line:10%
Or what kind of secrets
are they going to share?

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.590 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
because you don't know.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.798 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: I don't know at all.

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so this starts
with a man named Les this time.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: It's actually a woman.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, it's
a woman named Les?

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: And this all started--

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.283 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excuse me.

00:02:55.283 --> 00:02:58.310 align:middle line:10%
I saw the name Les, and made
an assumption it was a man.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.260 align:middle line:10%
OK, a person named
Les, a woman named Les.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.690 align:middle line:84%
So I want to hear
how this began.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.455 align:middle line:84%
And what did she
initially come to you for?

00:03:06.455 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Oh, my
gosh, like I said

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.170 align:middle line:84%
before, I'm not the one
that writes these books.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And this whole book,
this third book

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.120 align:middle line:84%
started because it started
right after I had this really

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.100 align:middle line:90%
interesting session with a man.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And while he was
deep under hypnosis,

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:84%
he remembered a
different lifetime, where

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.610 align:middle line:90%
he was an extraterrestrial.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And his job on this
other planet was

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.250 align:middle line:84%
to search the
universe for places

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.720 align:middle line:90%
where it could sustain life.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And basically, he was
searching and picking up

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.980 align:middle line:84%
different objects like a
rock, a solid, or a liquid.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And he would take
it back to a ship

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.330 align:middle line:90%
and focus consciousness into it.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And then with his
technology, they

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.180 align:middle line:84%
would read whether or not there
was a response from the object.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And if there was
response, then they

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.120 align:middle line:90%
knew this planet could see life.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I asked his
higher consciousness

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.200 align:middle line:84%
why did you show him this
lifetime of all the lifetimes

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.970 align:middle line:90%
you could show him?

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And they said
because we wanted him

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.890 align:middle line:84%
to remember that he was
part of the team that

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.270 align:middle line:90%
developed the human.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And he needs to remember
how powerful the human is.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.340 align:middle line:84%
He's not using this power
because, energetically, a human

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.640 align:middle line:84%
is energetically set up
to use their emotions.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.269 align:middle line:84%
They're built for
these severe emotions.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And whenever a human
experiences a severe emotion,

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.400 align:middle line:90%
it opens up a portal.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And within this portal,
are tons of possibilities.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted him
to start doing this.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:84%
They wanted him to
open up this portal

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.950 align:middle line:84%
by focusing on a very
strong, powerful, emotion,

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.860 align:middle line:84%
and then get the potentials
that are available to him.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.930 align:middle line:84%
So after this quiet
left, I thought, well,

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.990 align:middle line:90%
I want to try this technique.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.535 align:middle line:90%
So I did it.

00:04:47.535 --> 00:04:50.040 align:middle line:84%
I put myself into a
state of gratitude

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.040 align:middle line:84%
because it's the easiest
way to raise your vibration.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.490 align:middle line:90%
And I felt really good.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And then I imagined a
portal of light opening up.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And I just asked, OK, universe,
send me another subject.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm really excited.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.938 align:middle line:84%
What are you going to
share with me next?

00:05:03.938 --> 00:05:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Because, like I said,
it's so exciting.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.340 align:middle line:84%
I never know what they're
going to share with me.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.320 align:middle line:90%
So this is where it gets crazy.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.510 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
my phone pinged.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that might
not sound crazy.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:90%
But my phone was set to silent.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.820 align:middle line:90%
And I checked my phone.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.890 align:middle line:90%
And it was still set to silent.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.380 align:middle line:84%
But someone had
messaged me right

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.240 align:middle line:90%
when my eyes were still closed.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was this woman
I had never met.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.170 align:middle line:90%
Her name was Les.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And she said, this is
going to sound so crazy.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.150 align:middle line:90%
I know I sound so crazy.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.730 align:middle line:84%
But I had to contact
you right now.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.000 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know why.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry that I sound
like an insane person.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:90%
So I messaged her back.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, you don't
sound crazy, at all.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.500 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever done hypnosis?

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:90%
And she said no.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.740 align:middle line:90%
But she was willing to try.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did she
even know to call you?

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.190 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: That's the thing.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.960 align:middle line:90%
She got my number.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, it was a messenger.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.870 align:middle line:84%
She got my number
through somebody

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.220 align:middle line:90%
and was able to text me.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And normally, a message like
that can't even get through.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, now, was
there something specific

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.750 align:middle line:90%
she wanted to work on?

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: She had no idea.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.220 align:middle line:84%
She didn't really know
that much about me.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.900 align:middle line:84%
She just felt this strange,
weird desire to contact me.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh, OK.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.170 align:middle line:90%
So you meet Les.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yeah.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
starts happening?

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So she was a nice
bubbly, dirty blonde hair

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.610 align:middle line:90%
young woman, very friendly.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And as I brought her
deep under hypnosis,

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.370 align:middle line:84%
another sounding
voice came out of her.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.820 align:middle line:10%
It was her voice, but it
sounded almost like a man.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And this voice
said I am Anawaya.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm the one who contacted you.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm a Native American.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm contacting
you now because I

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.410 align:middle line:90%
need to tell our story.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Our story is vital to the
evolution of humanity.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.880 align:middle line:90%
I almost fell out of my chair.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.760 align:middle line:90%
I was like, oh, my gosh.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
direct and clear.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.750 align:middle line:90%
And what did she feel?

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.180 align:middle line:84%
At the end of it, was she
shocked by this whole thing?

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Her look was priceless.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.520 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing to tell you
you're a powerful being.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.350 align:middle line:90%
You have so much power.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:10.560 align:middle line:90%
You're a creator.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.930 align:middle line:90%
You never die.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.810 align:middle line:84%
But it's another thing to
experience that for yourself.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And I wish I could take pictures
of my client, sometimes.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.150 align:middle line:90%
She was in shock.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.630 align:middle line:84%
But it was shocking all,
like she was curious

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.920 align:middle line:90%
too so that it all made sense.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you know, Sarah,
I had this imaginary friend,

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.920 align:middle line:90%
when I was growing up.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.990 align:middle line:90%
And his name was Anawaya.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.160 align:middle line:90%
And now, it makes sense to me.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.500 align:middle line:90%
It was really just this person.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.500 align:middle line:84%
It was really another
version of me.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned
through many sessions

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.690 align:middle line:84%
that, sometimes, other
versions of ourselves

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.950 align:middle line:84%
come and talk to us
when we're children.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people think
they're imaginary friends.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.410 align:middle line:84%
But they're really
a version of us

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.703 align:middle line:84%
in a different dimension
checking on us.

00:07:53.703 --> 00:07:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And before we started
rolling camera here,

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.525 align:middle line:84%
I always kind of
check around just

00:07:59.525 --> 00:08:02.150 align:middle line:84%
to see who's in the room with us
because, usually, you can feel

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:03.570 align:middle line:90%
people's guides and everything.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And I told you beforehand,
there's a Native American here,

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.860 align:middle line:84%
a male Native
American entity here.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.750 align:middle line:90%
And so all this makes sense.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.710 align:middle line:84%
So I think still there
to try to make sure

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.410 align:middle line:84%
that the story is told properly
because I could feel him

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:20.210 align:middle line:90%
in the room.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Right, I
mean, this story,

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:84%
this information
is so important.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.770 align:middle line:84%
As the consciousness of
the Earth gets stronger,

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.440 align:middle line:84%
it's important for us to
connect with this consciousness,

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.820 align:middle line:90%
this intelligence.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.679 align:middle line:90%
But anyway--

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
let's get into him.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.990 align:middle line:84%
So Native American,
1800s, correct?

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Correct.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You actually
did some research

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.940 align:middle line:84%
to find out if any
such person existed.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.910 align:middle line:84%
So let's just kind
of set that part up

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.200 align:middle line:90%
before we go into his story.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So both of us, Les and
I, we researched and researched

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.970 align:middle line:84%
and try to find this
person named Anawaya.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And we did it
based off a drawing

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.190 align:middle line:84%
that she had drawn of
him from her memory.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And we found a person, and
it fit all the descriptions.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And actually, his name was
changed by the White man

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.640 align:middle line:90%
to Chief Billie Justice.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And even in
Anawaya's description

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.650 align:middle line:84%
of going to England and
everything like that,

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.210 align:middle line:90%
it was all in this history.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:20.840 align:middle line:84%
So I really do think we
found who Anawaya was.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.425 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
who Anawaya was in the day.

00:09:23.425 --> 00:09:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, my gosh.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.800 align:middle line:84%
So what was so interesting when
Anawaya was coming through,

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.940 align:middle line:84%
my client Les, was that he kept
saying he was very much alive.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, how
is this possible?

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.080 align:middle line:90%
How are you alive talking to me?

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And he said, basically,
if you can think about it

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.870 align:middle line:84%
like this anything that has
ever happened in anything that

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.480 align:middle line:90%
will happen, exists in the now.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And he said the way he
was contacting me was he

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.450 align:middle line:84%
was doing this really
interesting meditation.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:51.540 align:middle line:90%
I tried this, too.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to
work a little bit.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.630 align:middle line:84%
So you make your body
very, very still.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And by making your body still,
it makes your mind still.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And that really works,
if you try to do.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.040 align:middle line:84%
It brings you deep
into meditation.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.010 align:middle line:84%
But what I haven't figured
out how to do and he could do,

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:10.610 align:middle line:84%
was he would focus and
focus his concentration

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:16.940 align:middle line:84%
to Les, which is a past life, or
he's a passive version of her.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And he could communicate
to me, almost

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.320 align:middle line:90%
like a phone call in that way.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.780 align:middle line:90%
It's really quite fascinating.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And it reminded me
of Dolores Cannon

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.900 align:middle line:84%
when she would talk to
Nostradamus because he kept

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.490 align:middle line:90%
saying he was very much alive.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's true.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:33.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: And, oh, my gosh.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.820 align:middle line:84%
I've heard so many
different stories

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.440 align:middle line:90%
from so many different sessions.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:45.200 align:middle line:84%
But Anawaya's first hand account
of walking the Trail of Tears,

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.770 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't stop crying.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:47.570 align:middle line:90%
I lost it.

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:54.340 align:middle line:90%
It was so-- it's terrible.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in history,
you hear one story.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.010 align:middle line:84%
But to hear a firsthand
account is a different thing.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, would
you mind sharing it,

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.150 align:middle line:84%
even if it gets you
teary for a second

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.300 align:middle line:84%
because I think that
he wants that relayed?

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Yeah, I'll
try not to cry.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:14.072 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's really
hard for anybody--

00:11:14.072 --> 00:11:16.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain the
Trail of Tears for anyone

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.830 align:middle line:90%
who doesn't know.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Sure, it's
the term coined

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:24.430 align:middle line:84%
for the forced relocation of the
southeastern Native Americans.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.590 align:middle line:84%
They were forced out
of their homeland

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:30.700 align:middle line:84%
and forced west of
the Mississippi.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, there was gold
found on their territory.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.505 align:middle line:84%
And they were forced
out of their lands.

00:11:35.505 --> 00:11:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, is this part
of the Appalachian part

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.060 align:middle line:84%
of the story from
the Appalachian area,

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.600 align:middle line:90%
where the British--

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.825 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the British were
in control at that time?

00:11:43.825 --> 00:11:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yeah.

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.402 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where the British
forced them off of the land

00:11:46.402 --> 00:11:50.800 align:middle line:84%
and forced them to go West, so
they could take the resources

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.140 align:middle line:84%
from wherever they were--
no, from wherever they

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.870 align:middle line:84%
had originally been,
actually, Appalachia,

00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:01.790 align:middle line:84%
the way I have it written here,
was given to them in 1763.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:02.920 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yes.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that
didn't matter.

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: It didn't matter.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.065 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The settlers just
come and take what they want.

00:12:07.065 --> 00:12:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have
any rights, anyway.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:84%
So the trail, either
way, whether it

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.390 align:middle line:84%
was the original
relocation or just being

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:84%
bumped out after they
were being given land.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what
that looked like.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And I remember
in history class learning

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.150 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:27.610 align:middle line:84%
But what I didn't realize was
that it was more like genocide.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.200 align:middle line:90%
They were tortured.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.640 align:middle line:90%
They were murdered.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.140 align:middle line:90%
Women were raped.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think the worst part of
it for me was hearing about--

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.785 align:middle line:90%
gosh, try not to cry.

00:12:38.785 --> 00:12:41.520 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:46.600 align:middle line:84%
The children, you
know, just how people

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.470 align:middle line:90%
could do this to other people.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So I asked Anawaya why
did the White man do this

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.650 align:middle line:90%
to the Native Americans?

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And his answer was
so interesting.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.650 align:middle line:84%
He said the White man
was one of the earliest

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:06.010 align:middle line:84%
victims of this negative
energy that asserted itself

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:07.390 align:middle line:90%
onto the planet.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.600 align:middle line:84%
That the White man's
culture was stolen from them

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.360 align:middle line:84%
so long ago that the
White man doesn't even

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.790 align:middle line:84%
remember that they had
a culture, that they

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.880 align:middle line:90%
used to dance amongst fairies.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.280 align:middle line:84%
And they were
witches and pagans.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And they had all
these magical beliefs.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And all of that was
stolen from them,

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.120 align:middle line:84%
so they're walking around not
even remembering who they are.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And what I found
really interesting

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:36.190 align:middle line:84%
was how important this
information is, how--

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:41.980 align:middle line:84%
for Anawaya, he said that,
right before the Trail of Tears,

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:46.870 align:middle line:84%
the Nunne'hi, that's what he
called them, the fairy people,

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.780 align:middle line:84%
apparently, everybody knows
about the fairy people

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.130 align:middle line:90%
in Indigenous tribes.

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:52.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, all
over the planet.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yeah.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And they warned the
Native Americans, especially

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.550 align:middle line:84%
the Cherokee that,
if they didn't

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.190 align:middle line:84%
want to go through with this,
they could go underground

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:04.360 align:middle line:90%
into these tunnels.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is the same--

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:09.563 align:middle line:84%
that's the same lore in Britain
and particularly in Ireland.

00:14:09.563 --> 00:14:10.605 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, interesting.

00:14:10.605 --> 00:14:13.728 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That one group
of beings and anyone

00:14:13.728 --> 00:14:16.020 align:middle line:84%
that wants to watch us can
go back and look at my shows

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.600 align:middle line:90%
with Sean, Father Sean O'Laoire.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.950 align:middle line:90%
He talks about this.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:24.590 align:middle line:90%
Were driven underground very--

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:25.730 align:middle line:90%
we find beings.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Were driven underground
called the Tuatha de Danonn,

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.160 align:middle line:84%
which ended up being
the wisdom keepers that

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.100 align:middle line:90%
ultimately were the druids.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.320 align:middle line:84%
They were driven underground
by agreement just

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.260 align:middle line:84%
to be able to continue
to live on Earth.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And now, you're saying the
same thing in the Americas.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: The Nunne'hi
or the fair people said,

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:48.410 align:middle line:84%
if you don't want to be a
part of this, you can ascend,

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:49.340 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And you can ascend by going
deep within the Earth, which

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.230 align:middle line:90%
I thought is so interesting--

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Isn't
that fascinating.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: --because --because
you don't have to ascend upward.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.748 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: You can
ascend going within--

00:14:58.748 --> 00:15:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
what they did there.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: --same with the
survivors from Lemuria.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Many of them that
went to Mount Shasta

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.180 align:middle line:84%
by going deep
within the mountain

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:12.440 align:middle line:84%
there because of all the
crystals they were around.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.030 align:middle line:90%
They were able to ascend.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.380 align:middle line:90%
That's really fascinating.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.220 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you about
that really quickly.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure, do.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So I was
wondering, how did

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.500 align:middle line:84%
they ascend in Mount Shasta,
these survivors from Lemuria?

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And they said, by going
into the mountain,

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.490 align:middle line:84%
there were these
special crystals

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:31.340 align:middle line:84%
that were placed there
from the early colonizers.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And these crystals had
like a celestial converter.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And what these crystals
would do by using them,

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:44.060 align:middle line:84%
they would work with
the Earth's energy

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and the movement of the Earth
through the Milky Way galaxy.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And it would convert this
energy that the beings

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.065 align:middle line:84%
within the mountain
could use for food.

00:15:54.065 --> 00:15:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And by soaking
within this energy,

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.570 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
transform themselves.

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:01.130 align:middle line:90%
And ultimately, ascend.

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.860 align:middle line:84%
But they come in and
out of the mountain

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.280 align:middle line:84%
to kind of as an
agreement for us

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.830 align:middle line:84%
because they were a small
group that ascended.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And because they already
did it, their knowledge

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.480 align:middle line:84%
within this Earth helps
us as a collective ascend.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and people still
go to Shasta, for that reason.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.038 align:middle line:84%
And some claim to have
encountered these beings.

00:16:23.038 --> 00:16:24.080 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, interesting.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
still happening today.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And I've met a
couple of people who

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.140 align:middle line:84%
take people on tours
there because they've

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.320 align:middle line:90%
encountered these beings.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Wow.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.482 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So this still exists.

00:16:33.482 --> 00:16:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because you're

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.250 align:middle line:84%
talking about these crystals
and the frequency it's

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.890 align:middle line:84%
establishing for
ascension, which

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:41.480 align:middle line:90%
is a refinement of frequencies.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.930 align:middle line:90%
And it's all just frequencies.

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Food is frequencies.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:46.580 align:middle line:90%
It's all frequency, right?

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So speaking of
frequencies, so now we go back.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.300 align:middle line:84%
So the frequency going back
to what you said earlier

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:58.220 align:middle line:84%
that the early, quote,
"founding fathers," Europeans

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:02.090 align:middle line:84%
for the most part, were some
of the original people that

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:05.240 align:middle line:84%
were really tampered
with, in terms of what

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.160 align:middle line:90%
they call the fear virus.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
we hear quite a bit.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:13.700 align:middle line:84%
So how did Anawaya
describe this?

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:18.442 align:middle line:84%
And who were those who were
perpetuating this fear virus?

00:17:18.442 --> 00:17:20.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're going
back to the Anunnaki,

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.359 align:middle line:84%
back to Sumeria, back to
the same old characters.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So while I
was talking to Anawaya,

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.610 align:middle line:84%
he was often comforted by
his mother, who had passed.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:84%
She was murdered
by the white man.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And his mother
acted as a channel

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.000 align:middle line:90%
for these ancient ancestors.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
ancestors would

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:44.300 align:middle line:84%
come through Anawaya who
were ancestors in the tribe,

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Lemurians, and even
from the Pleiades.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to get
a lot of knowledge

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:54.920 align:middle line:84%
from these ancient ancestors who
described this negative energy

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.870 align:middle line:90%
coming to the planet like this.

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.430 align:middle line:90%
They said it's a cyclical thing.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.820 align:middle line:84%
The negative energy,
this fear virus,

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.650 align:middle line:90%
attached itself to the planet.

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And with that, it attached other
beings that feed off of fear,

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.110 align:middle line:90%
and it's cyclical.

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, we dispel
this fear and it goes back

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:16.740 align:middle line:84%
into the universe, only
to do this all over again.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a cycle, just like
we're all separated,

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.600 align:middle line:90%
chaos to bring the unity.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.200 align:middle line:90%
I mean, fear is a frequency too.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.330 align:middle line:90%
Love is a frequency.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:28.910 align:middle line:84%
So if everything is
constantly undulating

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and if you look at even the
Mayan calendar, for example,

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:36.230 align:middle line:84%
we have periods where we rise
and create and where we descend

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.190 align:middle line:90%
and forget.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, even
just forgetting

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.150 align:middle line:84%
starts bringing
anxiety and fear.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.610 align:middle line:90%
So that makes sense.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And so they're more
saying it's not

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:51.170 align:middle line:84%
that the beings that we
attribute to bringing

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.000 align:middle line:84%
these things to the
planet are bringing it,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.630 align:middle line:84%
it's they're simply riding
on the wave of the fear--

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:59.490 align:middle line:84%
the introduction of the fear
because they relate to it.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yes.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:01.915 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
can be opportunistic

00:19:01.915 --> 00:19:03.500 align:middle line:90%
within that field.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.000 align:middle line:90%
But this is just a cycle.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.060 align:middle line:84%
This is how it's
one of the rules

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:11.510 align:middle line:84%
if you want to incarnate
on this Earth planet.

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:14.150 align:middle line:84%
You have positive and
negative polarity,

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.440 align:middle line:84%
just like you have
life and death.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.260 align:middle line:90%
So there is no bad.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Nothing in this universe
is all negative.

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:22.440 align:middle line:90%
It feeds in together.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.310 align:middle line:90%
It's just one cycle.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.160 align:middle line:84%
That's why they use that
symbol of the circle.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere in these
Native American tribes,

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:31.700 align:middle line:90%
they use the circle.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And basically like
other different symbols,

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:39.350 align:middle line:84%
it's coded so that when
a person sees a symbol,

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.510 align:middle line:90%
it does something to the mind.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.300 align:middle line:84%
It unlocks this transmission
within the mind.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And really, there's a lot of
story behind this one symbol.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:50.173 align:middle line:84%
That's why all these symbols
come from the star people.

00:19:50.173 --> 00:19:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
circle on the cross.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Exactly.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:56.000 align:middle line:84%
The circle in the cross
means the cross is really

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.240 align:middle line:84%
for the four directions, but
the very point of the circle,

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.030 align:middle line:84%
the middle of the
circle, is to show us,

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.520 align:middle line:84%
to remind us that we
can remember we all

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:08.510 align:middle line:84%
come from source and we all
go out separate in order

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:09.590 align:middle line:90%
to come back again.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:10.397 align:middle line:90%
It's the cycle.

00:20:10.397 --> 00:20:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you see this all
over the world, the same symbol

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:13.820 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Of course.

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:17.030 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So they said one of
the ways in which fear has been

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:20.630 align:middle line:10%
perpetuated was by bringing
the notion of commerce

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:24.650 align:middle line:10%
and business, and monetary
exchange into the picture

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:28.160 align:middle line:10%
from what were more organic
tribal ways of living

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.260 align:middle line:10%
of abundance that had to do
with what nature could provide

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:32.070 align:middle line:10%
and so forth.

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.160 align:middle line:84%
So do you want to talk about
that for just a moment?

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Sure.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.460 align:middle line:10%
Well, when Anawaya
went to England

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.360 align:middle line:10%
to try to sign this
treaty, which, by the way,

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:45.680 align:middle line:10%
he never signed,
he said that they

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.220 align:middle line:10%
had very interesting
practices that they would

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.660 align:middle line:10%
use money instead of trade.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:54.260 align:middle line:84%
But for the Native
Americans, they use trade.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was a much better
way of exchange for them.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:01.430 align:middle line:10%
And he didn't really
understand the English ways

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:02.270 align:middle line:10%
because it was so--

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:03.740 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The monetary system?

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And that one
thing he couldn't get over

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.070 align:middle line:90%
was the smell.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:08.455 align:middle line:90%
Like it smells disgusting.

00:21:08.455 --> 00:21:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah,
of the cities.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:12.510 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have functioning
plumbing or anything, just

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:13.310 align:middle line:90%
out the window.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Throw their bath
water down the street.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So as he's
talking about their journey,

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.600 align:middle line:84%
so he explained their
journey to these other lands,

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.810 align:middle line:90%
let me ask you this.

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:30.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because obviously that
Les now is a woman, number one.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.828 align:middle line:90%
Is she Caucasian woman?

00:21:31.828 --> 00:21:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: She's Caucasian.

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:35.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
Native Americans

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:40.310 align:middle line:84%
had to start kind of
incarnating into the circles

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:42.200 align:middle line:84%
of modern beings
that are here now.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.170 align:middle line:84%
So many people that are
relating so strongly

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:48.650 align:middle line:84%
to the Native American
story, I would surmise

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.820 align:middle line:84%
is because they have
had that experience.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.830 align:middle line:90%
That's a past life experience.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:53.630 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Of course.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much trauma from
all of these Indigenous tribes

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:01.340 align:middle line:84%
all over the world that
we still carry with us.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And I really think that's
one of the reasons why

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:06.200 align:middle line:84%
they want this
story to get out now

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.780 align:middle line:90%
because there's so many stuck--

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:11.570 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like your soul is
not stuck, but a part of you

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:13.640 align:middle line:90%
is stuck because of the trauma.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And by hearing certain
stories like this

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:21.230 align:middle line:84%
or even talking about it, a part
of your soul can be released

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.070 align:middle line:90%
and you can rejoin with it.

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And because there's
so much trauma,

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.705 align:middle line:90%
I mean, generations of trauma.

00:22:27.705 --> 00:22:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: It creates more
density on the planet.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think they want
to get this story out

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.710 align:middle line:84%
to heal this trauma so
that the planet itself also

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:37.790 align:middle line:90%
becomes lighter.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's
a more gracious story

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:43.190 align:middle line:84%
because they're not just saying,
you white men are the bad guys.

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:44.030 align:middle line:90%
You did this to us.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.460 align:middle line:84%
They're saying, you white guys
are part of the same victim

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.330 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.197 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just
played it out--

00:22:49.197 --> 00:22:51.530 align:middle line:84%
it happened to you differently
and played it out--

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:53.570 align:middle line:84%
it played out through
you differently.

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it had
repercussions to us,

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.620 align:middle line:84%
but they're putting
the entire circle

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.800 align:middle line:84%
of how trauma happens
from one group passed

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.920 align:middle line:84%
on to another to another,
and generationally as well.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Exactly.

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And I always asked
Anawaya, were you angry?

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:10.140 align:middle line:90%
Were you mad that they did this?

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing that I really

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.780 align:middle line:84%
had a hard time
getting over was, no.

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:15.617 align:middle line:90%
They understood.

00:23:15.617 --> 00:23:16.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They understood.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yeah.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:23.690 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go to the
history of the Americas

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:27.770 align:middle line:84%
because he was
telling you Americas

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:30.030 align:middle line:84%
had very ancient,
very high cultures.

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:33.710 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into the
history, both from Lemuria

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:36.350 align:middle line:84%
and from Atlantis, and
what the Americas once

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:39.140 align:middle line:90%
were according to Anawaya.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Anawaya kept describing
the Americas as very advanced.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And the beings that lived on in
the Americas were advanced too.

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: They knew
all of these things.

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:54.950 align:middle line:84%
They were a lot different
than how you see people today.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:58.670 align:middle line:84%
They would speak with ETs
and interdimensional beings

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:02.750 align:middle line:84%
all the time, and they had very
powerful, powerful technology.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And all of that was wiped
out through sometimes

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:12.410 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial wars and
floods and things like that.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And all that evidence
has been removed just

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.720 align:middle line:90%
for one reason or another.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:24.410 align:middle line:84%
But I thought what was really
fascinating was that the ley

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:28.430 align:middle line:84%
lines were shifted after
the destruction of Atlantis

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:30.050 align:middle line:84%
because the
destruction of Atlantis

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:32.660 align:middle line:84%
was so powerful with
all their technology

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.300 align:middle line:84%
that it moved the ley
lines and the most

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:40.160 align:middle line:84%
powerful energetic grid shifted
from the capital of Atlantis

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.970 align:middle line:90%
to North America.

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of the reasons
why many Lumerians were taken

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.150 align:middle line:90%
and moved to the Americas.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
fascinating to me.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.320 align:middle line:84%
I was like, how
did they get there?

00:24:55.320 --> 00:25:01.010 align:middle line:84%
How did the Lemurian tribe get
from Lemuria to the Americas?

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:04.940 align:middle line:84%
I knew that some of them were
able to get to Mount Shasta,

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.100 align:middle line:90%
so that's part of the America.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.600 align:middle line:84%
But others apparently
were taken by ships.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
been one of the pieces

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.480 align:middle line:84%
that humanity hasn't really
been willing to look at yet,

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:22.400 align:middle line:84%
that the Wright brothers
didn't invent flight.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's been flight
throughout the universe,

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.470 align:middle line:90%
forever.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And there's been flight
to and from this planet

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.920 align:middle line:84%
forever with every
kind of technology.

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.610 align:middle line:84%
Groups of people have
been moved around

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:36.920 align:middle line:84%
since the beginning of time
because we were never here

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:40.115 align:middle line:90%
alone as just primitives.

00:25:40.115 --> 00:25:42.980 align:middle line:84%
We always had other
beings alongside us

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.360 align:middle line:84%
even as this species
was developing.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.167 align:middle line:84%
So if we can just
accept the notion

00:25:47.167 --> 00:25:49.250 align:middle line:84%
that there's always been
flight and there's always

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:51.920 align:middle line:84%
been an ability to move
populations of people around,

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.187 align:middle line:84%
then these great mysteries
aren't so mysterious after all.

00:25:55.187 --> 00:25:57.020 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to have
some big land bridge.

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.880 align:middle line:90%
Just fly them over.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.113 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right, exactly.

00:26:01.113 --> 00:26:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they talked
about this in the movement.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.947 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the movement of what

00:26:04.947 --> 00:26:07.160 align:middle line:90%
populations in particular.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, I
was so surprised

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.920 align:middle line:84%
that most of the
Native Americans

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.050 align:middle line:90%
originated from Lemuria.

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:16.980 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know this before.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And when the ancestors
were saying this,

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:21.930 align:middle line:84%
it all made sense
to me because when

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:25.440 align:middle line:84%
I was working on my Atlantis
book, I regressed Jen.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And when I brought her
deep under hypnosis,

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.060 align:middle line:84%
I had her draw the
symbol of Lemuria.

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was surprised because
it was the same symbol

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.570 align:middle line:90%
as the Native Americans use.

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
that's really interesting.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.140 align:middle line:84%
I didn't put two
and two together.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.390 align:middle line:90%
So then it made sense.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:46.563 align:middle line:84%
Oh, obviously most of
them were Lumerians.

00:26:46.563 --> 00:26:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It makes sense
on a number of levels

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.210 align:middle line:84%
as you say this because I've
interviewed lots of people,

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:52.020 align:middle line:90%
as you know.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that is repeatedly

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:57.840 align:middle line:84%
said about Lemuria, for those
who have a remembrance of it--

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:00.160 align:middle line:90%
I have some remembrance of it--

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:04.530 align:middle line:84%
and that is that the people
were living much more in harmony

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:09.180 align:middle line:84%
with, you might just
say frequency-based life

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.040 align:middle line:84%
technologies were
much more natural

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and frequency-based
telepathy was normal.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:17.250 align:middle line:90%
That was just normal.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And living closer to the land
without invasive technologies.

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how the
Native Americans, even

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:26.880 align:middle line:84%
in modern times, chose
to live and found

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.380 align:middle line:90%
a superior way of living.

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:30.480 align:middle line:90%
So that continued.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that understanding
and the connection

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.920 align:middle line:84%
with the others,
which I want to get

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.390 align:middle line:84%
to because this is about
their connection with the star

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:38.190 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:40.105 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about it.

00:27:40.105 --> 00:27:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Oh, well,
the star people

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:43.120 align:middle line:90%
were always helping them.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny that in all their
symbols and their drawings,

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:49.380 align:middle line:84%
they talk about the star
people helping them.

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And they relied on
the star people a lot

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:55.860 align:middle line:84%
for different things, but the
star people couldn't interfere.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.770 align:middle line:90%
They could just watch from afar.

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:00.420 align:middle line:90%
They could give them wisdom.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And they would get
some of this wisdom

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.990 align:middle line:90%
through their plant medicines.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:08.220 align:middle line:84%
They would do these ceremonies
and they would ask for wisdom.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting is as
they would do these ceremonies,

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:16.200 align:middle line:84%
they would all receive the same
message from the star people.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And they most of them seem to
have come from the Pleiades

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.780 align:middle line:84%
or they talked about
the Seven Sisters.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:22.920 align:middle line:90%
That's what they call them.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:23.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.730 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:24.330 align:middle line:90%
The Pleiades.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:24.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Right,
was the Pleiades.

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And which
had a strong influence

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:31.210 align:middle line:84%
over this planet for a very
long time and their own history

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:32.010 align:middle line:90%
with us.

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:34.005 align:middle line:84%
And some of the other
authors I've interviewed

00:28:34.005 --> 00:28:35.880 align:middle line:84%
have very deep connections
with the Pleiades.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.670 align:middle line:84%
So it appears that the
beings from the Pleiades

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:42.860 align:middle line:84%
are still to this day
trying to help us remember.

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, definitely.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And trying to help
us find our own way home, which

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:48.930 align:middle line:90%
is an internal journey.

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:50.880 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean to the stars.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Many beings
from the Pleiades

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:56.220 align:middle line:84%
come through my clients when
they're deep under hypnosis.

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.720 align:middle line:90%
And it's always so fascinating.

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.490 align:middle line:84%
They usually have
the same message,

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.160 align:middle line:84%
which is to try
to remind yourself

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.290 align:middle line:90%
that ultimately you are of God.

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so when--

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.780 align:middle line:84%
I guess this was
Les was speaking

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:14.780 align:middle line:84%
about some of the ET connections
with the people there.

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.620 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that they
talked about, or at least

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:20.470 align:middle line:84%
you told me they
talked about, was they

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:22.810 align:middle line:90%
explained the Mandela effect.

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:24.275 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: This is so interesting.

00:29:24.275 --> 00:29:25.150 align:middle line:90%
So they were saying--

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because we're
still mystified by it.

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So am I. They were
saying that the Mandela

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:34.750 align:middle line:84%
effect proves that you can
literally change your life

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.730 align:middle line:90%
based on what you focus on.

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:41.560 align:middle line:84%
That if a human's timeline
looks like a graph and so

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.130 align:middle line:90%
there's like a line.

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:47.750 align:middle line:84%
It'll be a very dark line as
to your most probable timeline.

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:50.290 align:middle line:84%
But if you focus
on something else,

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.410 align:middle line:84%
you can change your
timeline completely

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:57.220 align:middle line:84%
and you can have one person
have this line on a graph

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and another one way
over here, and they're

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:01.630 align:middle line:90%
living two different lifetimes.

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:03.640 align:middle line:84%
They won't remember
the same things

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.770 align:middle line:84%
because their lifetime
will be totally

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.912 align:middle line:90%
different than one another.

00:30:07.912 --> 00:30:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
say that the soul

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:13.540 align:middle line:84%
has the capability of inhabiting
two different vehicles

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:17.620 align:middle line:84%
or multiple vehicles at a
time on different timelines

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.350 align:middle line:84%
to have these
parallel experiences?

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, yes.

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:24.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we are all
multidimensional.

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:27.280 align:middle line:84%
We're living in so many
different timelines,

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.573 align:middle line:84%
on so many different places
all at the same time.

00:30:30.573 --> 00:30:32.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What else did
they have to say about that?

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Because people find
this fascinating.

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: I find it
really fascinating too.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.560 align:middle line:84%
That you can learn
to communicate

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.020 align:middle line:84%
with different parts
of yourself and you

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:43.420 align:middle line:90%
can open up that communication.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.780 align:middle line:84%
One way you can do that is
by looking at these symbols,

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.000 align:middle line:84%
like looking at the
flower of life pattern

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.880 align:middle line:84%
or looking at one of these
extraterrestrial symbols,

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.010 align:middle line:84%
like the circle with
the dot in the middle.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And you can activate
that communication

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.580 align:middle line:84%
with this higher
version of yourself

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.980 align:middle line:90%
and ultimately ask for guidance.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to go back to
something we talked about

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:07.640 align:middle line:84%
in the very beginning and have
you flesh it out some more.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do
with the uniqueness

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:13.160 align:middle line:84%
of the human emotional
structure and what

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:19.010 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to
create, but also

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:24.740 align:middle line:84%
how that works in opposition to
that on this planet of duality.

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.960 align:middle line:84%
So let's-- what did
they have to say?

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.790 align:middle line:90%
What did Anawaya have to say?

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:29.840 align:middle line:90%
Anawaya.

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:30.980 align:middle line:90%
Anaweya or waya?

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Anawaya.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Anawaya have to say--

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:34.107 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: It means
wolf apparently.

00:31:34.107 --> 00:31:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.760 align:middle line:84%
About the human
emotional structure

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and what it allows us to
create by way of these portals

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:42.253 align:middle line:90%
and how all of that works.

00:31:42.253 --> 00:31:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
always seen as kind

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:45.020 align:middle line:90%
of the bane of the existence.

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And I know we even have
other shows on saying, well,

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:52.200 align:middle line:84%
ETs don't think that human
emotions are that instructive.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.000 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Really?

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.140 align:middle line:84%
That's interesting because I've
been told that we're so unique

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and we don't realize
how much power we have

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:01.820 align:middle line:90%
because we have these emotions.

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.580 align:middle line:84%
That on some other planets
or some other beings

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:06.860 align:middle line:84%
have bred out their
emotions by accident,

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:10.620 align:middle line:84%
like the gray extraterrestrials
according to my clients.

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.490 align:middle line:90%
But you can use your emotions.

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And people are so powerful in
their energetics and the fact

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:20.240 align:middle line:84%
that they can use
these emotions.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:23.810 align:middle line:84%
But you want to use
your positive emotions.

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you'll invite or
you bring in more possibilities

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.370 align:middle line:90%
for discord.

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:31.550 align:middle line:84%
So by focusing on
a positive emotion,

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:34.700 align:middle line:84%
you really can manipulate
the matter around you

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.890 align:middle line:90%
in relationship to that emotion.

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:39.440 align:middle line:84%
You can even use this
to heal yourself.

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.420 align:middle line:84%
So basically what
they were saying

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:45.980 align:middle line:84%
was any time you feel a strong
feeling, a strong emotion,

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:49.250 align:middle line:84%
any time, always it
opens up portals.

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:51.380 align:middle line:84%
We're just not aware
of this, but this

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.250 align:middle line:90%
is how our energetics work.

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And so if you think of
these portals opening,

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:59.450 align:middle line:84%
when the portal opens, there are
plenty of possibilities to you

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:00.570 align:middle line:90%
when this happens.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:01.430 align:middle line:90%
So all you have--

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:02.150 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it worked.

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:02.950 align:middle line:90%
I tried it.

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And all you have to do
is focus on this emotion.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.490 align:middle line:90%
Ask for what you want.

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:10.040 align:middle line:90%
And this is the key.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.920 align:middle line:84%
If there's no resistance to it,
it will manifest very quickly,

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:14.720 align:middle line:90%
they said.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Maybe next time I will
ask for $1,000,000 but--

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when we actually
bring something that's

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.220 align:middle line:84%
genuine excitement
to the table, it

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.590 align:middle line:84%
seems to me that that's
one of the energies

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:29.450 align:middle line:84%
that you can manifest
very quickly with.

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yes.

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When it's
genuine excitement coming

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.150 align:middle line:84%
from inside you, bubbling
up from within you.

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right, exactly.

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Then there's really
no resistance,

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.210 align:middle line:84%
then the manifestation
happens very quickly anyway.

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:45.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So rather than
trying to manage our emotions,

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:48.590 align:middle line:84%
which everyone's trying to do,
it seems in this day and age

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:52.640 align:middle line:84%
anyway because it's
been a bumpy ride,

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.280 align:middle line:84%
maybe we would be
better off to start

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:59.510 align:middle line:84%
looking at how we can focus
them in truly innovative ways

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:02.870 align:middle line:84%
or in ways that actually
excite our entire being.

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:05.600 align:middle line:84%
Because like you said,
even that brings healing.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.980 align:middle line:90%
It brings a higher frequency.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.120 align:middle line:90%
It brings energy.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:08.929 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Exactly.

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And my clients, while
they're deep under hypnosis,

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:14.540 align:middle line:84%
the higher consciousness
keeps saying, now

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:17.810 align:middle line:84%
that these higher consciousness,
these higher realms

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:19.699 align:middle line:90%
are available-- they're here.

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:20.719 align:middle line:90%
They're available.

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:23.030 align:middle line:90%
This is all new to the human.

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:26.719 align:middle line:84%
And we can access this
great intelligence

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:29.420 align:middle line:84%
and actually become
the powerful being

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:30.949 align:middle line:90%
that we're meant to become.

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:34.429 align:middle line:84%
And this will become mainstream
as we go into the future.

00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:39.290 align:middle line:84%
But what you can do now is to
become aware of the subtleties

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:43.340 align:middle line:84%
going on in your body, the
subtle layers because there's--

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:45.320 align:middle line:84%
like I said, the
consciousness of the Earth

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.520 align:middle line:90%
is getting stronger.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.170 align:middle line:84%
It's constantly
communicating with us.

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I think
that is so fascinating

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.060 align:middle line:90%
is the use of the sun.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Many religions--

00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, talk about this.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Many religions had
the religion based on the sun.

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And I always wondered,
how do you use the sun?

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:07.320 align:middle line:90%
What is this all about?

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And what people don't understand
is the sun is a portal.

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:12.950 align:middle line:84%
So I'll just tell
you this example.

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:16.460 align:middle line:84%
I had this client come in and
she wanted to lose weight.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And she tried so many
different things.

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:20.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally she
went on a juice fast

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:22.080 align:middle line:90%
and the weight wouldn't budge.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.330 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, there
was something going on.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And usually when a client
wants to lose weight,

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:30.620 align:middle line:84%
their subconscious will
say, oh, the weight acts

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:32.420 align:middle line:90%
as like a protection.

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:34.200 align:middle line:90%
That's usually the case.

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you can figure out
a way to feel protected,

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:40.470 align:middle line:84%
the weight will come
off very easily.

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And the subconscious
needs to understand this

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:44.600 align:middle line:90%
and so does the conscious mind.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.320 align:middle line:90%
Well, this wasn't the case.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.350 align:middle line:84%
The higher
consciousness said, she

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:51.200 align:middle line:84%
needs to go outside
without her contacts.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And so that was a
little surprising.

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:55.710 align:middle line:90%
I asked, what do you mean?

00:35:55.710 --> 00:36:00.140 align:middle line:84%
And they said, she needs to be
exposed to unfiltered sunlight

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:05.200 align:middle line:84%
because humans, all humans, need
a little unfiltered sunlight.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately, what's
available to humanity

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:12.760 align:middle line:84%
right now is the power of
this intelligence coming

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.610 align:middle line:84%
from the portals
of the sun, it goes

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:20.500 align:middle line:84%
through the unfiltered eyes
straight to the pineal gland,

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:24.230 align:middle line:90%
and it unlocks the human power.

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So true.

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's interesting
that came through.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And you and I did a session that
you transcribed a little bit

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:35.320 align:middle line:84%
about and the sun played hugely
in that, back in Atlantean

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:36.340 align:middle line:90%
times too.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And also the whole notion
of going out in the morning,

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:43.960 align:middle line:84%
for example, for people who
are just having this memory

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:44.760 align:middle line:90%
come back again.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To go in the early
blush of the morning when

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.470 align:middle line:84%
the sun's first rising, and
even if you're just looking

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:53.470 align:middle line:84%
at the sun through your
eyelashes to begin with,

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:58.090 align:middle line:84%
to just open your eyes for
however many seconds and take

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:02.410 align:middle line:84%
the fullness of the cool sun's
information into your being

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:05.240 align:middle line:84%
first thing in the
morning has a phenomenal--

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:08.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad you brought it up
because I stopped doing it too.

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.880 align:middle line:90%
Has a phenomenal effect.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:13.210 align:middle line:84%
But they're saying
also go out in and--

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:15.430 align:middle line:84%
I would think bathe yourself
in it however you can,

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:18.428 align:middle line:84%
but they say definitely through
the eyeballs, unfiltered.

00:37:18.428 --> 00:37:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: That's so
interesting because I'm always

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:21.790 align:middle line:90%
wearing my glasses.

00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:23.260 align:middle line:90%
So I stopped doing that.

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And even just a
little bit, they said,

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:29.360 align:middle line:84%
will unlock these dormant
potentials within ourselves.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
so much for bringing

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:33.250 align:middle line:90%
that bit of information back.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Even after you and I
did the regression,

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:38.470 align:middle line:84%
I still didn't go back and
start practicing it again.

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:41.110 align:middle line:84%
It's so funny how we just
kind of get into our groove.

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:45.102 align:middle line:84%
But every time I do that, it
makes a massive difference.

00:37:45.102 --> 00:37:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And recently, I've started
doing that early in the morning,

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.260 align:middle line:84%
to go out and just
lie in the sun

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:53.110 align:middle line:84%
very early in the morning when
it's kind of first cresting

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:56.207 align:middle line:84%
so it can hit the body
when it's still cool out.

00:37:56.207 --> 00:37:57.790 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
be-- it doesn't have

00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:59.590 align:middle line:90%
to be in the harsh heat of day.

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Because we forget the sun
is the source of all life.

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:08.110 align:middle line:84%
And in our solar
system, on all planets,

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:10.240 align:middle line:90%
nothing exists without the sun.

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just it's
casting light and heat,

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:16.660 align:middle line:84%
it's casting massive
amounts of information

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.430 align:middle line:90%
as a very divine, massive being.

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And information is
coming through the sun.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.325 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And that's one
way we get our information.

00:38:25.325 --> 00:38:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From the central
sun through our sun into us.

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I'm so excited
that you talked about this

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:33.490 align:middle line:90%
and brought this up.

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Tell me what else they had to
say, the Native Americans had

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:38.080 align:middle line:84%
to say, because they
were very oriented

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.970 align:middle line:90%
toward the sun and the stars.

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:42.770 align:middle line:84%
What else did
Anawaya have to say?

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well,
they kept reminding

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.740 align:middle line:90%
us to connect with nature.

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:51.260 align:middle line:84%
That basically, like I
said, this is all cycle.

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:55.030 align:middle line:84%
So we needed to lose our
connection for a while

00:38:55.030 --> 00:39:01.210 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing like having
opposition to remembering.

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:04.030 align:middle line:84%
So we needed this
disconnection in order

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:06.670 align:middle line:84%
to really appreciate
our reconnection.

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And that is essentially what
we're supposed to do now.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:11.650 align:middle line:84%
We're supposed to
remember these teachings

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.770 align:middle line:84%
of the Native Americans or
the Indigenous tribes all

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:15.580 align:middle line:90%
over the world.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:16.997 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who were
us at one time.

00:39:16.997 --> 00:39:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are incarnated
that way and just forgot.

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:20.380 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:20.537 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:20.537 --> 00:39:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And we're supposed
to bring back that knowledge

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and reconnect to the Earth
to our natural surroundings,

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:29.140 align:middle line:90%
start communicating with it.

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Because within the Earth,
there's always a cure.

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:36.560 align:middle line:84%
There's always a plant that
will help you with something.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.950 align:middle line:84%
There's always an
answer to your question.

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Everything is provided
for us within the Earth.

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And by the sun.

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: And by the sun.

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember my guide
saying, years ago saying,

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:53.380 align:middle line:84%
they're very big on this,
never worship anything, anyone,

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:58.570 align:middle line:84%
no worship, but you can
give as much love and care

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:02.500 align:middle line:84%
and respect as you wish to
the sun or any other being

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.340 align:middle line:90%
or entity.

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:04.570 align:middle line:90%
That works.

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Worship is simply giving power
away and putting yourself

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:08.980 align:middle line:90%
below something.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And they said even the
sun, don't put yourself

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:15.550 align:middle line:84%
below the sun, but you can
send your extreme appreciation

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:19.360 align:middle line:84%
and love to the sun as
it's always sending to you.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And so on that note,
one of the final things

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:26.380 align:middle line:84%
that was coming through
from these various beings

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.650 align:middle line:84%
and from the star people is,
again, the message of love.

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:31.540 align:middle line:90%
Love, love, love, love.

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:37.330 align:middle line:84%
As you said earlier, when you
go into a session yourself,

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:39.430 align:middle line:84%
you find gratitude
is the fastest

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:41.740 align:middle line:90%
way to lift your frequencies.

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:43.150 align:middle line:90%
I find the same thing.

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:45.820 align:middle line:90%
Love is so loaded.

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:51.910 align:middle line:84%
It has so many different kind
of attached notions as to what

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:53.510 align:middle line:90%
love even is anymore.

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:54.700 align:middle line:90%
So if you can--

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying this because if
you can explain in their words

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:02.860 align:middle line:84%
what they mean by love and
maybe what we mean by gratitude

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:06.910 align:middle line:84%
and appreciation, respect,
care, and love that come out

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:09.250 align:middle line:84%
of gratitude, this
is a place I think

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:12.200 align:middle line:84%
we all need to start going
to besides just the Earth.

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.000 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, I feel as if gratitude
is really harmonizing.

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:19.850 align:middle line:84%
It's harmonizing with
yourself and your environment.

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And really
feeling the oneness.

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:27.250 align:middle line:84%
But the way they describe love
it's sort of different than how

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:28.150 align:middle line:90%
we describe love.

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:32.380 align:middle line:84%
They describe love
as that moment when--

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:35.590 align:middle line:84%
say, for instance, when a
client is remembering leaving

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:37.450 align:middle line:90%
their body after a lifetime.

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:40.090 align:middle line:84%
There's a moment
of complete bliss

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:43.420 align:middle line:84%
and a rejoining of all
the parts of themselves.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:46.060 align:middle line:84%
If a human were to experience,
they would just start crying.

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:48.520 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't be able to
take this really, really

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.920 align:middle line:90%
powerful feeling of oneness.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.150 align:middle line:90%
It's so overwhelming.

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:53.530 align:middle line:90%
It's so beautiful.

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:56.690 align:middle line:84%
But that's what they
mean when they say love.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:42:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if we can
connect in our own memory

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:01.450 align:middle line:90%
to these feelings.

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:04.520 align:middle line:84%
That may happen say through
the birth of a new baby.

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You see a baby
who's just come into the world

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and is starting this journey,
and those little eyes that

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:16.540 align:middle line:84%
seemingly are seeing everything
for the first time, that

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:20.420 align:middle line:84%
would be one of those moments
of tears, for example,

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.570 align:middle line:90%
and the purity of love.

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Or whatever it is to each
person that can bring us--

00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:27.550 align:middle line:90%
maybe it's a sunset.

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:31.330 align:middle line:84%
So if we can remember those
moments of that feeling,

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:33.100 align:middle line:84%
that's the love
they're talking about.

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
purity, that bliss.

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:38.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's a good practice,
to just remember,

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.990 align:middle line:84%
remember those moments
of love so we can just

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:43.757 align:middle line:84%
keep bringing our
frequencies up and up and up.

00:42:43.757 --> 00:42:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Definitely.

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.120 align:middle line:90%
And gratitude.

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.410 align:middle line:90%
Any final thoughts, Sarah?

00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:49.840 align:middle line:84%
This is really just
a beautiful story

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.170 align:middle line:90%
that they brought through.

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh.

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:52.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:53.650 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:55.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm always so excited
to see what they're

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:57.220 align:middle line:90%
going to share with me next.

00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:59.860 align:middle line:10%
But basically, I guess the
final thoughts would just

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:02.830 align:middle line:10%
be to really be curious
about your own self.

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:05.620 align:middle line:10%
Go deep within
yourself and see what

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:09.820 align:middle line:10%
it is that drives you, what your
passions are, and really try

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:12.220 align:middle line:10%
to connect deep within
yourself and listen,

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:15.940 align:middle line:10%
and go out into nature and
start harmonizing yourself

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:19.270 align:middle line:10%
with nature, and getting that
intelligence from nature.

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:21.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:23.230 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely beautiful as always.

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:27.265 align:middle line:84%
And so I can't wait to hear
who comes through who next.

00:43:27.265 --> 00:43:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Me too.

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we'll
have you back on.

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Sarah.

00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.820 align:middle line:10%
Again, the name of
Sarah's new book

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:37.750 align:middle line:10%
is "A Hypnotist's Journey From
the Trail to the Star People."

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000 align:middle line:90%
