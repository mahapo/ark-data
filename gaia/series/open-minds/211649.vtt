>>CYNTHIA SUE LARSON:
Bible changes, for example.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.120 align:middle line:84%
We used to have the lion
would lay down with the lamb.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.253 align:middle line:90%
And it's no longer that.

00:00:15.253 --> 00:00:17.003 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: It
was always the lion.

00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: I remember that.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've never
heard of the wolf.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And how do we attune
ourselves to listen?

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Because through listening,
then you can be heard.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.210 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like cooking
something in the oven.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Taking it out of the oven half
baked means it's not complete.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.340 align:middle line:84%
I like to ask, how
good can it get?

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you're asking a
question that helps you focus,

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.780 align:middle line:90%
it reframes everything.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Just keep it simple,
heads, hearts, and guts.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And so if you realize, what is
this unified will right now?

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Do I really have
unification of myself?

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Most of us never
even look at that.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.840 align:middle line:90%
It's like a combination lock.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And you can't really open
any magical possibility,

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.670 align:middle line:84%
any adjacent reality, unless
you've got the combination.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.292 align:middle line:90%

>>REGINA: We're so happy
to have Cynthia Sue Larson.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.370 align:middle line:10%
Back with us today.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.390 align:middle line:10%
We're going to continue our
explanation of the Mandela

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:10%
effect as new questions and
answers are arising constantly.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.480 align:middle line:84%
It's an endlessly fascinating
topic for almost all

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.060 align:middle line:84%
of us, especially
for you because you

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.720 align:middle line:90%
have your nose into it.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I
want to start with because--

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.450 align:middle line:84%
for anyone who hasn't already
seen our previous shows,

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.570 align:middle line:90%
take a look at them.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.540 align:middle line:84%
But one thing you're finding is
that chapters of your own books

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.930 align:middle line:90%
have gone missing.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.730 align:middle line:90%
No, wait.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.308 align:middle line:90%
OK, how is that even possible?

00:01:30.308 --> 00:01:31.475 align:middle line:90%
You must have the originals.

00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: OK, I do
have the originals.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's not the entire
chapter, thank goodness.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.540 align:middle line:10%
But--

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.340 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Pieces.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.900 align:middle line:10%
>>LARSON: Yes, significant
pieces are going missing.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And for example, in my
book "Quantum Jumps"

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.210 align:middle line:84%
that came out in 2013, now
it's about 10 years later.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.060 align:middle line:10%
And I've started noticing that--

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.160 align:middle line:10%
well, I just noticed
in 2019 actually,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.110 align:middle line:10%
so it goes back a few years.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.370 align:middle line:84%
In 2019, I was planning to, at
the conference on the Mandela

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.670 align:middle line:84%
effect, explain what I had in
mind with the cover of the book

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.400 align:middle line:84%
and to describe what
that was all about.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.580 align:middle line:84%
But the entire explanation
paragraph is completely gone.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.380 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.110 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.910 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.960 align:middle line:90%
The idea was that--

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.460 align:middle line:84%
it was to bring together the
many worlds of quantum physics,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.780 align:middle line:84%
the many worlds theory with
the multiverse in the cosmos

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.680 align:middle line:84%
and the idea of jumping
through a quantum wormhole,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.710 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.910 align:middle line:90%
And that's gone.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.327 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer in
the book at all.

00:02:26.327 --> 00:02:28.452 align:middle line:84%
And that's just one of two
books that have changed.

00:02:28.452 --> 00:02:30.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's just talk
about that for a minute.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.300 align:middle line:84%
So now if you go back
to your originals,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.670 align:middle line:84%
the original documents before
you went to publishing,

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.750 align:middle line:90%
it's in there, right?

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.875 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: No.

00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:39.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not even there?

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: It's not
there, not at all.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And I can't find it in
any version of the book.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.700 align:middle line:84%
It's just completely
like it never existed.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
dig down into that.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.650 align:middle line:84%
If it's completely
disappeared, so it's

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:84%
taken a separate track
of consciousness,

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.320 align:middle line:84%
what would be the
possible advantage

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.764 align:middle line:84%
and to whom for having
that paragraph disappear?

00:02:59.764 --> 00:03:01.139 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: That's
a good question.

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.135 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who
would that benefit?

00:03:02.135 --> 00:03:04.302 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I don't know who
exactly it would benefit.

00:03:04.302 --> 00:03:05.635 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What would it benefit?

00:03:05.635 --> 00:03:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I think it
gives us an insight

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.020 align:middle line:90%
that anything can change.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen
other books change.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Lots of people notice
Bible changes, for example,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.650 align:middle line:84%
like we used to have the lion
would lay down with the lamb.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.915 align:middle line:90%
And it's no longer that.

00:03:20.915 --> 00:03:21.990 align:middle line:90%
It's not that at all.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.847 align:middle line:84%
It's the wolf will lay
down with the lamb.

00:03:23.847 --> 00:03:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah it
was always the lion.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: I remember that.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've never
heard of the wolf.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So who benefits
from these things?

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.160 align:middle line:84%
I think all of us do ultimately
when we recognize that this

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.000 align:middle line:90%
is sort of a global phenomenon.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.258 align:middle line:84%
It's much bigger than
just one particular book.

00:03:38.258 --> 00:03:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
look at that, you

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:84%
look at the wolf instead
of the lion, I mean,

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.470 align:middle line:84%
what could the metaphysical
esoteric implication

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:84%
of shifting from
a lion to a wolf

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.505 align:middle line:84%
be in that passage on a
level of consciousness?

00:03:52.505 --> 00:03:53.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm just playing with this.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're not supposed
to be talking about this.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:90%
It's just me being curious.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.980 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Exactly.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that there's
an advantage of looking

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.130 align:middle line:90%
at wolf consciousness.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.590 align:middle line:84%
People might think like,
wolves, what are they good for?

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.460 align:middle line:90%
But they work together.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.810 align:middle line:84%
There is a community within
a wolf community, whereas--

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.600 align:middle line:84%
there's something like that
with the lions as well.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.170 align:middle line:84%
But there's this
tremendous social quality,

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.079 align:middle line:84%
which the Mandela
effect also is actually,

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.060 align:middle line:84%
when we notice
collectively that there's

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.690 align:middle line:90%
been some kind of a change.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.660 align:middle line:84%
It's much more
than just noticing

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.780 align:middle line:84%
at home that your socks
are not in the dryer

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.120 align:middle line:84%
or that something has moved,
your keys, or your purse,

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.920 align:middle line:84%
or something, or
that you've seen

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.785 align:middle line:90%
some other mysterious change.

00:04:34.785 --> 00:04:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's just annoying.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.277 align:middle line:84%
So you say we're awaiting the
dawning of the fifth world.

00:04:39.277 --> 00:04:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
key in all of this.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go
into all of the kinds

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.030 align:middle line:84%
of phenomena choices that
have to be made and so forth.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.360 align:middle line:84%
First of all, what
is the dawning

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.840 align:middle line:90%
of the fifth world to you?

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: OK.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've been following
the Hopi mythology.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote an article
for "Parabola Magazine"

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.710 align:middle line:84%
a couple of decades
ago actually.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's very
important because when

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.000 align:middle line:84%
I look at the stories,
which to me are

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.020 align:middle line:84%
much more than just stories,
they tell the inner realm.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.970 align:middle line:90%
It's the imaginal realm.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.950 align:middle line:84%
It's where reality
comes from when

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.510 align:middle line:84%
you recognize that
some stories are

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.810 align:middle line:90%
more than just a simple story.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:16.740 align:middle line:90%
It's not mythology.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not fake.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:18.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not fiction.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea
is that the world

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.950 align:middle line:84%
has gone through very strong
upheavals, a great deal

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.460 align:middle line:90%
of crisis, catastrophe.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.495 align:middle line:84%
And each time this happens,
humans make it through.

00:05:32.495 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:84%
I think that's-- I like to
look at the good things.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the
mass extinctions

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.102 align:middle line:90%
you're speaking of, right?

00:05:37.102 --> 00:05:37.245 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:05:37.245 --> 00:05:38.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That we're still here.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And I've been fascinated
with this topic

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.600 align:middle line:90%
ever since I was quite young.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.140 align:middle line:84%
I did a science project
in seventh grade

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.098 align:middle line:90%
looking at coral reefs.

00:05:47.098 --> 00:05:48.307 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course, you did.

00:05:48.307 --> 00:05:51.030 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yeah, I wanted to look
at the mass extinction events.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that they were
happening in a very punctuated

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.695 align:middle line:90%
equilibrium way.

00:05:55.695 --> 00:05:57.450 align:middle line:84%
They happened with
certain frequency

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.520 align:middle line:90%
and almost predictability.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And so there would be
tremendous climate changes that

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.700 align:middle line:84%
would kill off whatever the
ocean coral species were

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.630 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what I
was studying back then.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And so bringing
that idea forward

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.560 align:middle line:84%
and finding that
the Hopi had been

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.540 align:middle line:90%
telling what they call stories.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.930 align:middle line:84%
But they also-- it sounded
true to me because they speak

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.010 align:middle line:90%
of things--

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.540 align:middle line:84%
of great floods and
great fires and humans

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.080 align:middle line:84%
coming through with some
help and some ability

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.210 align:middle line:84%
to rise above the
drama basically

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.720 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that we
have two paths to choose

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.760 align:middle line:84%
at any one of these
decision points.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And we can choose to stay
calm and stay focused

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle line:84%
on what matters
most, which is love

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.700 align:middle line:84%
because that's eternal,
that's infinite.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And those are the things
that can't be measured.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.820 align:middle line:84%
But when we fixate instead on
the measurables, the money,

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.655 align:middle line:84%
the power, and so forth, we
can get seriously off track?

00:06:53.655 --> 00:06:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and we're
all bearing witness to it.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.937 align:middle line:90%
The climate is changing.

00:06:57.937 --> 00:06:59.145 align:middle line:90%
It does change periodically--

00:06:59.145 --> 00:06:59.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It does change.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --very,
very dramatically.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's changing
dramatically and trying

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.690 align:middle line:84%
to turn it into a divisive
political issue rather than,

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.940 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't it be a
beautiful world if we

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.130 align:middle line:84%
could look at it for
what it is and say

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.890 align:middle line:90%
this happens every so often?

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And what is the
highest opportunity?

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Not to be confused with
continuing to pollute.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.830 align:middle line:90%
That's not good no matter what.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.560 align:middle line:84%
We should be treating
our Earth very kindly.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.710 align:middle line:84%
But wouldn't it be amazing
if we could talk about it

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.200 align:middle line:84%
on a historical
level as the Hopi

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.400 align:middle line:84%
and other ancient Indigenous
tribes do speak of it?

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And then what could that
look like if we embraced it

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.420 align:middle line:90%
on that level--

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That could be--

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --collectively--

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:38.085 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: --wonderful

00:07:38.085 --> 00:07:40.752 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --instead of trying to
cash in on some carbon credits?

00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Right, because then
we can start managing really

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.530 align:middle line:90%
the people that we can be.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Humans have the ability to
be caretakers of wonder,

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.090 align:middle line:90%
caretakers of the Earth.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And by listening
closely to what's

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.470 align:middle line:84%
happening as things
change instead of

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.840 align:middle line:84%
trying to keep them
the same, then it's

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.275 align:middle line:84%
possible to listen to
the Earth, to recognize

00:08:00.275 --> 00:08:02.150 align:middle line:84%
that if it's really hot,
that's still summer.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.270 align:middle line:84%
That kind of thing, which, I
think, in Western thinking,

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.790 align:middle line:90%
we started regimenting nature.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:08.600 align:middle line:90%
We decided that--

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.228 align:middle line:90%
Summer should be the masters.

00:08:10.228 --> 00:08:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And so if we look at instead,
how do we partner with it?

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.580 align:middle line:84%
How do we find
friends within nature?

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And how do we attune
ourselves to listen?

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Because through listening,
then you can be heard.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's the big
takeaway that I

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.780 align:middle line:84%
think humans are
learning gradually

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.143 align:middle line:84%
each time the world comes to
an end and another world--

00:08:29.143 --> 00:08:30.018 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think so.

00:08:30.018 --> 00:08:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And there are more and
more people awake now

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:36.470 align:middle line:84%
than have been in some of
the past mass extinctions.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's fair to
say we were unconscious in all

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.970 align:middle line:84%
of them because we were
quite conscious once

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.400 align:middle line:84%
upon a time in our
far, far history.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.080 align:middle line:84%
So I would be curious
to know with far memory

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.130 align:middle line:84%
how humanity that was
more awake and conscious

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.580 align:middle line:84%
and in partnership with
nature went through these,

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.180 align:middle line:84%
what became known as mass
extinction or severe weather

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.000 align:middle line:90%
type events.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well,
it's hard to know

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:02.710 align:middle line:84%
for sure because we
don't have written

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:03.790 align:middle line:90%
records of most of this.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:04.780 align:middle line:90%
It's oral traditions.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.330 align:middle line:84%
But what I've learned
and seen firsthand

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.460 align:middle line:84%
is that the shamanic
tradition is

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.690 align:middle line:84%
very instrumental in
managing these crisis points,

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:17.140 align:middle line:84%
recognizing that there can be
those, for whatever reason,

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.960 align:middle line:84%
that have access
into communicating

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.860 align:middle line:84%
with some of these other beings
and levels of conscious agency.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's say we have
an awareness on this planet

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:32.020 align:middle line:84%
as our weather continues to get
wilder and more unpredictable.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Is it inevitable that it goes
into one of these events?

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Or can we learn-- can
we call upon beings

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.340 align:middle line:84%
who are elements
of nature and know

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:84%
how to work with nature
to even soften some

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.020 align:middle line:90%
of the influences that happen?

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:51.790 align:middle line:84%
Or does Earth need this
kind of violent upheaval

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:52.765 align:middle line:90%
to refresh herself?

00:09:52.765 --> 00:09:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: When I go
into meditations,

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.470 align:middle line:84%
I've been asking about
the nature of evil.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.610 align:middle line:90%
Why is that necessary?

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:59.193 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems
like if we could just

00:09:59.193 --> 00:10:00.980 align:middle line:84%
get to the root
of all of that, we

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.360 align:middle line:84%
could make some
serious progress.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It seems so.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And then we
could guide ourselves

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.530 align:middle line:84%
through this next, what could
be cataclysmic transition

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:11.030 align:middle line:90%
into something much smoother.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:15.290 align:middle line:84%
But what I heard when I tuned
into that infinite eternal love

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.210 align:middle line:84%
was that it's kind of like
cooking something in the oven.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And if we need to bake
something or you're

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:24.020 align:middle line:84%
following a recipe, taking
it out of the oven half

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.610 align:middle line:90%
baked means it's not complete.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And for human
consciousness, it looks

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.080 align:middle line:84%
like it's not just
the front runners that

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.520 align:middle line:90%
are being considered here.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.450 align:middle line:90%
It's all of humanity.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And so there needs to be
an evolutionary progression

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.970 align:middle line:90%
for everybody.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.063 align:middle line:84%
And until that happens,
it looks like we

00:10:40.063 --> 00:10:42.230 align:middle line:84%
may need to go through a
couple more of these cycles

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.930 align:middle line:84%
after this one, which
might seem crazy

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.210 align:middle line:84%
because this one that
we're coming into right now

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.930 align:middle line:90%
already looks pretty severe.

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.580 align:middle line:84%
But the Hopi talk about that
after the seventh world, when

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.880 align:middle line:84%
we reach that, then we'll
be able collectively

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.410 align:middle line:90%
not to have to go through those.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And it makes sense to me
because at that point,

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.730 align:middle line:84%
I think we'll have enough
people that understand

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and how to maintain,
for example, aircraft.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Like if you're on a
flight and there's

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:12.780 align:middle line:84%
a prediction of turbulence, then
you can absolutely manage that.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And we can do the same thing
coming into one of these

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.630 align:middle line:84%
cataclysmic events,
whether it's--

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:18.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm thinking

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.695 align:middle line:84%
of because you
and I were talking

00:11:19.695 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:90%
about we do that on airplanes.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, why can't
this be done on a larger scale

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.018 align:middle line:84%
than simply amending
turbulence on a flight?

00:11:27.018 --> 00:11:28.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: I think we can do it.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's definitely
something that

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.540 align:middle line:84%
works with weather with
all of these things that

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:38.540 align:middle line:84%
seem like acts of God, things
like volcanic eruptions

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.370 align:middle line:90%
and earthquakes, all of that.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
things are happening

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.620 align:middle line:84%
more because the Earth's tilt
is a little bit more pronounced.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.500 align:middle line:84%
The electromagnetic field
is down, shields are down,

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.300 align:middle line:84%
so we're more vulnerable
to getting some

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.900 align:middle line:90%
of the solar weather patterns.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:52.310 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.675 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Definitely.

00:11:52.675 --> 00:11:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And then there could
be something really cataclysmic

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.500 align:middle line:90%
like a solar micronova.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.670 align:middle line:90%
Some people talk about that.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.450 align:middle line:84%
All of these things fall
under the same basic area.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.765 align:middle line:84%
So we can definitely have
impact and influence.

00:12:04.765 --> 00:12:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the two paths, the
Hopi prophecy stone in Arizona,

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.638 align:middle line:84%
let's go back to that because it
says there will be two paths--

00:12:11.638 --> 00:12:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right, it does.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --to choose between.

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And many, many people feel we're
at a choice point right now.

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: My interpretation
of this because it's basically

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.920 align:middle line:84%
a petroglyph, it's
carved in stone--

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.900 align:middle line:84%
and many people have
different reads on it.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.920 align:middle line:84%
I first read interpretations
in the book "The Rocks Begin

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.690 align:middle line:84%
to Speak," which is
a wonderful book.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:32.000 align:middle line:84%
But my own take on it
right now because it

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.810 align:middle line:84%
seems so timely has to do with
recognizing one of these paths

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:38.600 align:middle line:84%
looks like basically
transhumanism.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.670 align:middle line:84%
The other path
definitely looks more

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:45.140 align:middle line:84%
like retaining and
growing, evolving

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.240 align:middle line:84%
all of our own
innate natural skills

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and abilities and basically
spirit-given gifts.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's pretty clear to
me which is the better

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.540 align:middle line:84%
path because the
path that fizzles out

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.580 align:middle line:90%
is the transhumanist path.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:03.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the one where these little
very regimented little beings,

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:06.180 align:middle line:84%
they all look like carbon
copies of one another.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.640 align:middle line:90%
It looks robotic to me.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.180 align:middle line:90%
They sort of fizzle out.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.320 align:middle line:84%
So the line, the timeline
sort of goes into a cloud

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.310 align:middle line:84%
or vanishes, whereas the other
line seems to continue on.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And to stay in
harmony with the Earth

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:22.490 align:middle line:84%
requires listening, being
flexible, sometimes not getting

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:25.220 align:middle line:84%
what we want, needing to
grow up along the way,

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.250 align:middle line:84%
maturing, rising
above the drama.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And these are not
easy things, so I

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:35.420 align:middle line:84%
can understand why people might
prefer to dream of a utopian

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.210 align:middle line:84%
world where everything can
be taken care of for us

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.400 align:middle line:84%
by robots, by
artificial intelligence.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.000 align:middle line:84%
But to me that looks
like a bad trade.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.895 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:13:44.895 --> 00:13:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And if I were people
listening to this,

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.450 align:middle line:84%
I would listen to you
because you are a mystic.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:51.890 align:middle line:90%
And you do have future visions.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.170 align:middle line:84%
So your visions are
important to listen to.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And so there comes
now the opportunity

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:03.170 align:middle line:84%
every single day for every
single one of us as to how much

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:04.940 align:middle line:84%
power, how much
energy we're going

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:08.540 align:middle line:84%
to give over to AI
in whatever form

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.605 align:middle line:90%
because it's not going away.

00:14:10.605 --> 00:14:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It's not going away.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm not
recommending people

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.680 align:middle line:84%
put their head in the
sand and ignore it

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.250 align:middle line:84%
or be a complete Luddite
or anything like that.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what
I'm suggesting is

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.670 align:middle line:84%
to remember to maintain
connections with meditation,

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.020 align:middle line:90%
with your home, with your land.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With the Earth.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: With the Earth.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With the cosmos.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes, the cosmos.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.115 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With your soul.

00:14:32.115 --> 00:14:34.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes, absolutely.

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And what I call levels
of conscious agency.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's recognizing that
you can tune into your head.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.390 align:middle line:84%
You can see where
your head is at.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.180 align:middle line:84%
But you notice at the same
time if your gut is feeling

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.860 align:middle line:84%
differently or your
heart feels differently,

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:51.300 align:middle line:84%
you need to maybe pay
attention and pull it together

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.250 align:middle line:90%
within your one self.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And so that might mean if
you're going through something

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.632 align:middle line:84%
and you might want
to rush through it.

00:14:57.632 --> 00:14:58.590 align:middle line:90%
I've been through that.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:01.110 align:middle line:84%
I've wanted to rush
through unpleasant things

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:90%
like I was going through.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
that's the head

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:06.540 align:middle line:90%
trying to lead the way.

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:10.200 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes the heart needs to
stay open and go through things

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.500 align:middle line:90%
that it might not want to.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.260 align:middle line:84%
But there can be great
gifts in the pain sometimes.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes that pain
point can be so painful

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:19.040 align:middle line:84%
that people pull
away, they recoil,

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.230 align:middle line:90%
they don't want to face it.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:21.770 align:middle line:90%
But that's the stuck point.

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:22.700 align:middle line:90%
So you need to--

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:23.500 align:middle line:90%
I agree with--

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.325 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Go and stay
in that stuck point.

00:15:25.325 --> 00:15:26.125 align:middle line:90%
Focus.

00:15:26.125 --> 00:15:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Breathe with it.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.945 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Breathe with it
until it breaks through.

00:15:28.945 --> 00:15:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: It's like
giving birth almost.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.820 align:middle line:90%
It's like--

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:32.582 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: --recognizing--

00:15:32.582 --> 00:15:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To whatever your
new creation from your soul

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.900 align:middle line:84%
is going to be,
personal or collective.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.320 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And there's a saying
by a great Native American

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.920 align:middle line:84%
in Canada from Winnipeg
area, Toba Seneca Kino.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And he said what things
want to happen together.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're mentioning
from this great book

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.410 align:middle line:84%
from Blavatsky, it
reminds me of that.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: "Land of
the Gods," yeah.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yeah, because it's
not just our own personal will.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a higher level of
will that's operating.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And so when corn is planted
with beans and other plants that

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.320 align:middle line:84%
grow well together, then that's
what wants to happen together.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And when we recognize
sometimes we're

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:14.140 align:middle line:84%
a part of something, that
may feel personally painful.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.290 align:middle line:90%
But it has a greater purpose.

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:18.720 align:middle line:90%
Then we can start to feel that.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we have
to be still with it

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:21.760 align:middle line:84%
and breathe with
it and not run away

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.910 align:middle line:84%
from it because going
down to the core,

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:26.230 align:middle line:90%
we don't know what's there.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know what's
going to show itself.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Exactly.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:32.920 align:middle line:10%
And part of this AI incursion
can sometimes present an issue

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.320 align:middle line:10%
where people might feel
that they're worthless,

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.320 align:middle line:10%
or they might feel challenged
like, what good are you doing?

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.318 align:middle line:84%
These are the kind of questions
that if they provoke fear

00:16:41.318 --> 00:16:42.610 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't make any sense--

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On top of fear.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: On top
of fear, then that

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:46.330 align:middle line:90%
would be a false voice talking.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.895 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: So it's really
important for people

00:16:48.895 --> 00:16:51.370 align:middle line:84%
to tune in and recognize
that, ask questions

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.220 align:middle line:84%
even if you're feeling that
this thought came to you

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.522 align:middle line:90%
but it's not your thought.

00:16:55.522 --> 00:16:56.980 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
things to be aware

00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:00.370 align:middle line:84%
of in this interesting time that
we're starting to enter into.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, these divine
souls trump AI, period.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.270 align:middle line:84%
You speak of this as--
you call it Revhumanism.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:08.480 align:middle line:90%
I'd never heard that before.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.385 align:middle line:90%
So tell us what that means.

00:17:10.385 --> 00:17:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to go into
the subject of free will a bit,

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:16.044 align:middle line:84%
what's our will versus
outside versus manipulation.

00:17:16.044 --> 00:17:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: OK,
Revhumanism is a word

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.859 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to give credit
back to this Indigenous

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:21.680 align:middle line:90%
way of thinking.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And so I came up with a
word to counterbalance

00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:28.720 align:middle line:84%
this transhumanism because we
hear the word transhumanism,

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.490 align:middle line:84%
and rather than
being opposed to it,

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.500 align:middle line:84%
it's good to have something
to be in favor of.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.410 align:middle line:84%
So to be in favor
of Revhumanism means

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:40.240 align:middle line:84%
to recognize this renewal
possibility, revitalization,

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.290 align:middle line:90%
and reverence.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And these qualities are
part of our divine being.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's really the divinity
within all of nature,

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.742 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves, and to
recognize that exists.

00:17:50.742 --> 00:17:52.450 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like that
sparkle that light

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.150 align:middle line:84%
that we have, that
feeling of love

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:58.270 align:middle line:84%
that comes from the heart, that
genuine sense of connection.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And these things are critical,
absolutely essential.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And without them,
the world could just

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:08.928 align:middle line:84%
atrophy into this
other possibility.

00:18:08.928 --> 00:18:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:11.815 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: It's another option
instead of transhumanism.

00:18:11.815 --> 00:18:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:16.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, going into the
even more fully embracing

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:17.980 align:middle line:84%
the totally materialistic
view of life,

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.780 align:middle line:84%
we're already hopefully
kind of getting

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.090 align:middle line:90%
toward the tail of that dog.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:27.040 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, we have the
human being historically knows

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.900 align:middle line:90%
that we're part of other realms.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Everyone watching
this knows there

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:34.600 align:middle line:84%
are other realms, be it
playful, be it angelic,

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.240 align:middle line:84%
even those who play
tricks, even tricksters,

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.180 align:middle line:84%
that we're one realm among
many, and that interface

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:43.610 align:middle line:84%
between realms is where a lot
of intelligence comes from.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:45.820 align:middle line:84%
So if we wipe that
out and just go

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.940 align:middle line:84%
for a simple, sophisticated
continued development

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:52.748 align:middle line:84%
of algorithms, what happens to
our multidimensional connection

00:18:52.748 --> 00:18:53.665 align:middle line:90%
with the other realms?

00:18:53.665 --> 00:18:55.957 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Well, it's seriously
atrophied at that point.

00:18:55.957 --> 00:18:58.013 align:middle line:84%
I think it still exists
because I believe it's--

00:18:58.013 --> 00:18:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's still
trying to reach us.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It's still trying.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we're not
acknowledging it at that point.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.137 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:19:03.137 --> 00:19:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the
great battle that's

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.220 align:middle line:84%
happening right now, if
you want to use that word.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.470 align:middle line:84%
It does seem like it's a
battle for our hearts, minds,

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:10.410 align:middle line:90%
and souls.

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is the time to
really tune in and listen

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.620 align:middle line:90%
to the difference.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:17.130 align:middle line:84%
If you hear a voice that
doesn't seem to have that soul,

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:19.500 align:middle line:84%
then question it,
question it deeply

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.230 align:middle line:84%
because something
that has the soul

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:25.830 align:middle line:84%
of this idea of Revhumanism
will come through

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:29.260 align:middle line:84%
with a lightness of vibrancy,
a sense of possibility,

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.068 align:middle line:90%
a sense of joy.

00:19:30.068 --> 00:19:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't feel
any of those things--

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:32.265 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And gentleness.

00:19:32.265 --> 00:19:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And
gentleness for sure.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.050 align:middle line:84%
So those are the key things
to feel and look for.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And when we recognize
that this is possible,

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:43.140 align:middle line:84%
then we can start to
experience it more and more

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.050 align:middle line:84%
and expand our high
sense perception moving

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:49.530 align:middle line:84%
into this interdimensional
realm and our own evolution

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.695 align:middle line:90%
as interdimensional beings.

00:19:51.695 --> 00:19:54.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
requires making choices.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And that gets us to the
subject of free will

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:02.030 align:middle line:84%
and multidimensional access to
self higher mind, lower mind,

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:02.830 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:05.070 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into it
because it's usually not

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.310 align:middle line:90%
explained very well.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:08.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's really not.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:11.610 align:middle line:84%
I like to start, just to give
people a point of reference,

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.120 align:middle line:84%
with Gottfried Wilhelm
Leibniz, the philosopher.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And he was an
extraordinary genius.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.620 align:middle line:84%
He came up with the
idea of calculus,

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.360 align:middle line:90%
along with Sir Isaac Newton.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm starting there because
he had these beautiful ideas,

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.830 align:middle line:84%
along with the philosophia
perennis, which

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.660 align:middle line:84%
is the perennial
philosophy, which

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.020 align:middle line:84%
means that at the pinnacle
of a pyramid of thought,

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:37.200 align:middle line:84%
at the very top would be
the infinite, the eternal,

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.010 align:middle line:90%
the absolute.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And then all of the paths of
philosophy and spirituality

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.698 align:middle line:84%
that lead up to it,
they're physically felt,

00:20:44.698 --> 00:20:46.740 align:middle line:84%
they're the ones that are
practical down to Earth

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.180 align:middle line:84%
that we can observe
day to day and follow.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.240 align:middle line:84%
But somewhere along
the line, they all

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.030 align:middle line:84%
come together at that pinnacle,
at the point, at the top.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's where this
eternal infinite love exists.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So now I wanted to
lay that groundwork

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.525 align:middle line:84%
because if you know
calculus-- most people don't

00:21:03.525 --> 00:21:04.325 align:middle line:90%
study calculus.

00:21:04.325 --> 00:21:05.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I don't know.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: OK.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, a basic
concept in calculus

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:13.750 align:middle line:84%
is recognizing that you can
look at levels of things.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
definitions that Leibniz

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.790 align:middle line:84%
gave of consciousness is
that there's a first order

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:23.040 align:middle line:90%
sensitivity or awareness.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Like if you're holding
a pencil or a pen,

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:26.400 align:middle line:90%
you can feel it in your fingers.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
second order, which

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.630 align:middle line:84%
is awareness, that that's
you holding the pencil

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.114 align:middle line:90%
and that that is a pencil.

00:21:32.114 --> 00:21:34.320 align:middle line:90%
So you can see how this works.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The layers of
observation and consciousness.

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And those
can be considered

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:42.043 align:middle line:84%
layers of dimensional awareness
and dimensional consciousness.

00:21:42.043 --> 00:21:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And so this is where it gets
very interesting because some

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.390 align:middle line:84%
of those interdimensional beings
that can play around with--

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.790 align:middle line:84%
people might say that's
messing with our free will

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:53.010 align:middle line:84%
because they're moving
things in my house.

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:56.340 align:middle line:84%
We've got elves or
whatever or ghosts,

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.320 align:middle line:90%
some interdimensional being.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.680 align:middle line:84%
But we ourselves have
access to this as well we

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.100 align:middle line:90%
are interdimensional beings.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And when we recognize
we can access

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:09.930 align:middle line:84%
our own interdimensionality
through meditation, such

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.520 align:middle line:84%
as you know that
that's your pencil--

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.440 align:middle line:84%
some people meditate
just by holding something

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.430 align:middle line:84%
like a pencil in their hand and
just focusing entirely on that.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And that experience
gives you the ability

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:22.830 align:middle line:84%
to recognize the
focusing ability

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:24.570 align:middle line:84%
so that you can
focus your attention,

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:26.070 align:middle line:90%
focus your intention.

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And it may seem tedious to do
this kind of a simple practice.

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:33.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's the root of
all of the bigger ideas.

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is this
the precursor to then

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.455 align:middle line:90%
forming clear and clean will?

00:22:37.455 --> 00:22:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Through such simple beginnings,
it creates a solid foundation

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.780 align:middle line:84%
so that then you can
start to ask things like--

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.460 align:middle line:84%
I like to ask, how
good can it get?

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:49.500 align:middle line:84%
That's your favorite
question, which I love.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yeah.

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:53.070 align:middle line:84%
So if you're asking a
question that helps you focus,

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:55.240 align:middle line:90%
it reframes everything.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And so you can ask that
question in a really dark night

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:58.860 align:middle line:90%
of the soul moment.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And it might seem like
it's almost sarcasm,

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:03.030 align:middle line:90%
like how good can it get?

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:06.150 align:middle line:90%
You got to be kidding me.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.820 align:middle line:84%
But amazingly, even
in such conditions,

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.530 align:middle line:90%
you can start to see above.

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Just the fact that you're asking
the question, nature answers

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.260 align:middle line:90%
that question instantly.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, you're
lifted out of the funk

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:21.830 align:middle line:84%
and out of that feeling
of being static, stasis.

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:23.270 align:middle line:90%
And you can reach ecstasy.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:26.300 align:middle line:84%
You can reach joy, which
is that's exactly what you

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.130 align:middle line:84%
find with that infinite
eternal point of view.

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how does that feed
into the notion of free will--

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: OK, getting there--

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --which is kind
of like an application

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.490 align:middle line:90%
of intention, right?

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:37.765 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:23:37.765 --> 00:23:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then the
whole notion of free

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.923 align:middle line:84%
is a whole other
thing on top of it.

00:23:40.923 --> 00:23:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: OK, exactly.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And I love the idea
of sovereignty.

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:44.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm all about freedom.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Me too.

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: OK.

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:49.250 align:middle line:84%
But it gets a little thorny
here because obviously--

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:53.460 align:middle line:84%
I think when we say I and we get
into like, whose will is this?

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.070 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Instantly, we don't
necessarily pay attention

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.710 align:middle line:84%
to the levels of conscious
agency that each of us

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:04.610 align:middle line:84%
exists with, that we carry
with us every day, that we're

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.010 align:middle line:84%
working with our heads,
our hearts, and our guts,

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:09.050 align:middle line:84%
or you can look at
the seven chakras.

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.240 align:middle line:84%
But just keep it simple,
heads, hearts, and guts.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And so if you realize what is
this unified will right now?

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Do I really have
unification of myself?

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.637 align:middle line:84%
Most of us never
even look at that.

00:24:20.637 --> 00:24:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd say we
have to start there.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In other words,
is your head and your guts

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.120 align:middle line:90%
and heart, are they lined up?

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.380 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Are they lined up?

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.030 align:middle line:90%
It's like a combination lock.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And you can't really open
any magical possibility,

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:36.450 align:middle line:84%
any adjacent reality, unless
you've got the combination.

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:37.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's all--

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:38.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
beautifully said.

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.990 align:middle line:84%
So really, if you're
contemplating something,

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:middle line:84%
you should go
through the exercise

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.970 align:middle line:84%
of checking in with
each aspect of self

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:50.910 align:middle line:84%
and finding out if they're in
alignment with one another,

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:52.340 align:middle line:90%
if you have coherence.

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.720 align:middle line:84%
That's going to go a long
way toward, I would think,

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.520 align:middle line:90%
an end effect.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you can do this with
honesty, integrity, and love,

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:01.250 align:middle line:90%
then something magical happens.

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And you might surprisingly
find that what you had thought

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:09.440 align:middle line:84%
was not your will was exactly
what your subconscious needed.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.412 align:middle line:84%
And that can be a big
shock, a huge shock.

00:25:11.412 --> 00:25:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give us
examples of that.

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:14.267 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Well, like--

00:25:14.267 --> 00:25:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even something
in your own magical life.

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yeah.

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was going to pick
something ordinary, kind

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:20.130 align:middle line:90%
of pedestrian.

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:22.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's fine
too, whatever you prefer.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yeah.

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.820 align:middle line:84%
For example, just getting
started doing this line of work

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:29.160 align:middle line:90%
was a shock to my system.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.080 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't bad.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.930 align:middle line:84%
But it was just starting off
doing something completely new,

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:37.200 align:middle line:84%
leave banking behind and
project management and even

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.250 align:middle line:90%
science before that.

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:39.750 align:middle line:84%
So I felt like,
what am I doing now?

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:41.430 align:middle line:90%
This is crazy.

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like terrifying
actually to go through that.

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I've gone
through other things,

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.250 align:middle line:90%
like I went through a divorce.

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:52.030 align:middle line:90%
I've lost loved ones.

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.370 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite family
members was my grandmother.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And when she died, I was
just devastated, of course.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
be at her bedside

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.910 align:middle line:84%
just through a series of
remarkable synchronicities

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:06.360 align:middle line:84%
and amazing magical
things that happened,

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.760 align:middle line:84%
including attending
a book event that I

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.380 align:middle line:90%
didn't have on my calendar.

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.290 align:middle line:84%
They phoned to remind me of
something I'd never scheduled.

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:15.990 align:middle line:90%
So it was Sacramento Bookstore.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I was there the day
that she happened to pass away.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:23.580 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that was so
interesting about free will

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:27.810 align:middle line:84%
is I chose to be there because
the bookstore called me.

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And they called me because,
obviously, in advance,

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.510 align:middle line:84%
something or some
level of consciousness

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.227 align:middle line:84%
knew that I needed
to be at a place

00:26:36.227 --> 00:26:37.560 align:middle line:90%
that I would never be otherwise.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:40.260 align:middle line:84%
I would not be visiting
her in Sacramento.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.470 align:middle line:84%
It was a two-hour drive
away from Berkeley.

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.310 align:middle line:84%
I had to make child
care arrangements.

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:46.630 align:middle line:90%
So I did all that stuff.

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:48.600 align:middle line:90%
And then I'm there.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.715 align:middle line:84%
And you might say,
what's the free will?

00:26:50.715 --> 00:26:52.620 align:middle line:90%
How did I absolutely--

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who
arranged that for you?

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Who arranged it?

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And I would say now it's
hard to say exactly.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:00.390 align:middle line:84%
But it would be at a
higher level of myself

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:03.240 align:middle line:84%
in collaboration
with my grandmother.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And this can be found
in many events that

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:07.800 align:middle line:84%
happen where there's this
divine orchestration.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
see with synchronicity.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.907 align:middle line:84%
People that experience
synchronicity the most

00:27:12.907 --> 00:27:14.490 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that
are asking questions

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:17.610 align:middle line:84%
about reality, that
have an empathic nature,

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:20.998 align:middle line:84%
and that are capable of asking
these questions about what's

00:27:20.998 --> 00:27:23.040 align:middle line:84%
going on at these higher
levels of consciousness.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not
resisting the results.

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:26.700 align:middle line:84%
It may not turn
out like you like.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.410 align:middle line:84%
But the more you
resist it, I think

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:31.230 align:middle line:84%
the more the system starts
shutting down because it shows

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:32.400 align:middle line:90%
you're not open to the flow.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:35.160 align:middle line:90%
That's a really good point.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And being open to that flow
without that resistance

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:39.480 align:middle line:90%
is so key.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's not reinforced much
in our Western way of living.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we have to be
truthful with ourselves,

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:50.610 align:middle line:84%
go into coherence with how the
aspects of our mind, dimensions

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:53.280 align:middle line:84%
of our mind, what
it truly feels,

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.520 align:middle line:84%
what each aspect is truly
feeling, truly desiring,

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.020 align:middle line:84%
see if there's some
coherence there.

00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.687 align:middle line:84%
And then that might
direct our free will

00:27:59.687 --> 00:28:02.070 align:middle line:84%
toward an intention or
an end of some kind.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yeah, and
we may find that

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:05.320 align:middle line:84%
what wants to happen
together is something

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:08.250 align:middle line:84%
we never would have picked
with our conscious mind at all.

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:09.460 align:middle line:90%
And it could be a surprise.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.030 align:middle line:84%
But then if you listen
honestly to your-- especially

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:12.890 align:middle line:90%
your subconscious.

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:15.800 align:middle line:84%
That tends to get left
out of most decisions.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.605 align:middle line:84%
But then you find, OK,
this is right for me.

00:28:18.605 --> 00:28:19.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, in the end.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:21.563 align:middle line:84%
Just like your experience,
you talked about.

00:28:21.563 --> 00:28:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And we've all had these
kinds of experiences,

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:26.630 align:middle line:84%
like I can't believe I was
there just at that moment.

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:27.540 align:middle line:90%
What put me there?

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.900 align:middle line:84%
So for you,
everything comes down

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.990 align:middle line:84%
to essentially staying
optimistic, like you say,

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:34.070 align:middle line:90%
how good can it get?

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:37.370 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people right now feel
like things are challenging.

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And they know about how even
weather-- even something as

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.680 align:middle line:84%
innocuous and powerful as
the weather is changing,

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.110 align:middle line:90%
how we can't predict things.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:49.610 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a lot of control
over even something as simple

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:50.410 align:middle line:90%
as our--

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:52.500 align:middle line:84%
and not as complex
as our environment.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And so how-- for you, it's
about maintaining optimism

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:01.520 align:middle line:84%
no matter what is
occurring externally.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about how you
do that because you're really

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:05.270 align:middle line:90%
a master at it.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Well, thanks.

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:07.805 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's a practice.

00:29:07.805 --> 00:29:10.240 align:middle line:90%
It takes practice for me too.

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And I've had points where
I've looked at that, like,

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.670 align:middle line:84%
do I really want to hold
the course and stay?

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:17.290 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes, absolutely.

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's good to know that you're
choosing that for yourself.

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm doing is pruning
out all the possible mes

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.410 align:middle line:84%
and the possible timelines
where that's not the case.

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:29.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm choosing not to go
there, not to have that--

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:32.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're not putting
your mental, which is magnetic.

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:34.120 align:middle line:84%
You're not putting your
mental energy there--

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:34.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's right.

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --or your
emotional energy there.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.758 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: That's right.

00:29:36.758 --> 00:29:38.740 align:middle line:84%
So that includes my
past, which some people--

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:41.200 align:middle line:84%
I think people that watch
your show understand that.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.570 align:middle line:84%
That's a huge
subject right there,

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:46.540 align:middle line:84%
pruning the past and
also the future and also

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:48.190 align:middle line:84%
all the adjacent
current timelines,

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:50.920 align:middle line:84%
recognizing that
I'm choosing to stay

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:55.090 align:middle line:84%
radically optimistic regardless,
that how good can it get?

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:56.320 align:middle line:90%
It's like a battle cry.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.270 align:middle line:90%
It's very much so.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.460 align:middle line:84%
People might think it's
very peaceful, and it is.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.600 align:middle line:90%
It's very gentle.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.605 align:middle line:90%
But it's powerful.

00:30:02.605 --> 00:30:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And the companion
to that is kindness.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:08.050 align:middle line:90%
And I totally agree with you.

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:12.160 align:middle line:84%
The field I saw was very
chaotic with some instances

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.320 align:middle line:84%
of clarity, light, and
directional thought

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.480 align:middle line:84%
from the people who
still know how to do it.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And what I saw that
was sad was that there

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:22.270 align:middle line:84%
were becoming at this time
actually decreasing numbers

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:25.870 align:middle line:84%
of people able to hold that
coherent, clear thought

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:28.630 align:middle line:84%
that you were talking
about earlier.

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And that
ability is so important.

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:31.720 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's challenging
to do, especially

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.190 align:middle line:84%
like you saying in
these chaotic times

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.170 align:middle line:84%
because there's
somewhat challenging,

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:41.140 align:middle line:84%
striving for our
attention, trying

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.240 align:middle line:84%
to grab our attention,
whether it's the media

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.800 align:middle line:84%
or what we're supposed
to care about, whatever

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:45.805 align:middle line:90%
the political thing of the day--

00:30:45.805 --> 00:30:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Fear is being foisted
on us is the correct thing.

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yeah, whatever we're
supposed to be afraid of--

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:51.987 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Trying to fit in
fashionably with whichever side

00:30:51.987 --> 00:30:52.787 align:middle line:90%
we've chosen.

00:30:52.787 --> 00:30:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.990 align:middle line:84%
But if we recognize,
that's all nonsense.

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:59.710 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing of the
divisiveness is ridiculous.

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Then it's possible to
regain that focus again.

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:03.175 align:middle line:90%
It's never too late.

00:31:03.175 --> 00:31:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's not too late.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.780 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I did see that.

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:10.360 align:middle line:84%
But the point that you make is
that from that field of chaos,

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:16.160 align:middle line:84%
it takes that love, care,
kindness, and really purity

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.140 align:middle line:90%
of intention and desire.

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:22.175 align:middle line:84%
And we can shift that field
back to a field that's coherent.

00:31:22.175 --> 00:31:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yes, and
that's what nature loves.

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.630 align:middle line:84%
That's what I see when
I work with nature.

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:28.235 align:middle line:90%
That's how nature listens.

00:31:28.235 --> 00:31:31.760 align:middle line:84%
If we have that unification,
that purity of heart,

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:35.000 align:middle line:84%
that sincere genuine
need, then that's

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.920 align:middle line:84%
when we have
influence over things

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.245 align:middle line:90%
that seem like acts of God.

00:31:39.245 --> 00:31:41.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly.

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:43.850 align:middle line:84%
So you also-- I want to get into
this because we haven't talked

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:45.320 align:middle line:90%
a lot about the Mandela effect.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.330 align:middle line:84%
But that's embedded
within all of this.

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Every one of these choices is
going to change inexplicably

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:52.430 align:middle line:84%
these outcomes to
where we think we

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:56.390 align:middle line:84%
have mass psychosis because
we're all remembering it wrong.

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:58.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's all being
affected by this.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:02.330 align:middle line:84%
So you make-- you draw lines
between Mandela effect, reality

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:05.150 align:middle line:84%
shifts, timelines,
afterlife, and dream time.

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:08.178 align:middle line:84%
We only have a few
minutes left, so--

00:32:08.178 --> 00:32:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Pull it all together.

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, pull
it all together for us.

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: OK.

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, basically
the Mandela effect

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:17.050 align:middle line:84%
is that collective recognition
that we remember things

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:17.850 align:middle line:90%
differently.

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And I would recommend people,
please, hang on to that.

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:22.643 align:middle line:84%
If you remember something,
then it happened.

00:32:22.643 --> 00:32:23.443 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:32:23.443 --> 00:32:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
also universities

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.000 align:middle line:90%
are studying it now.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: They sure are.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's actually getting
some real academic attention

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:30.710 align:middle line:90%
as to how this happens.

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.920 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful
landmark paper

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.890 align:middle line:84%
that was published in
2019 by researchers

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:38.210 align:middle line:90%
at University of Chicago.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And that was where the
researchers Bainbridge

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and Prasad, two
beautiful researchers--

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:44.900 align:middle line:90%
and it was an amazing study.

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.730 align:middle line:84%
They worked with--
first, 100 people

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:49.130 align:middle line:84%
were the research
study participants.

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And they were looking at
different characters, such as,

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.580 align:middle line:90%
for example, "Where's Waldo?"

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:58.760 align:middle line:84%
He was one of them, Pikachu
from the cartoon character.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.220 align:middle line:84%
They had some logos, too,
Fruit of the Loom logo.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So some of the things
we've seen and were aware of.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.415 align:middle line:84%
And so what did they
discover in this study?

00:33:06.415 --> 00:33:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: What
they discovered is

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:09.748 align:middle line:84%
they did three different
versions of the study.

00:33:09.748 --> 00:33:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was just
recognizing which of the images

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:14.360 align:middle line:90%
is correct.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.570 align:middle line:84%
For example, Curious George
with a tail, without a tail.

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:21.860 align:middle line:84%
People tended to remember very
strongly together with a tail.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:23.810 align:middle line:84%
They also had a
different kind of a tail.

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:26.360 align:middle line:84%
But people remembered
the same kind of a tail.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And then they'd ask for the
Fruit of the Loom, that logo,

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:33.530 align:middle line:84%
bunch of fruit together with
a basket or on a platter

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:34.370 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.950 align:middle line:84%
People, instead of choosing
the platter or by itself,

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:41.010 align:middle line:84%
they chose in a cornucopia,
all of the collection of fruit,

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:42.630 align:middle line:90%
which is what I remember, too.

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:43.760 align:middle line:90%
And so a number of these--

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.760 align:middle line:84%
I think seven of these
things, "Where's Waldo?"

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:50.150 align:middle line:84%
He has a walking stick
with a curved top.

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And the monopoly man has a
monocle, not two glasses.

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:56.790 align:middle line:84%
So these are very-- of
course, it makes sense.

00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:01.130 align:middle line:84%
But why-- the researchers wanted
to know why is it that people

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:02.060 align:middle line:90%
not only--

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.310 align:middle line:90%
they called it misremember.

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:07.130 align:middle line:84%
I would say it's a mismatched
memory that they remember it

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:07.250 align:middle line:90%
differently.

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But collectively.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.699 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Yes,
they collectively--

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:12.130 align:middle line:84%
large groups of them are
collectively remembering them

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:15.639 align:middle line:84%
the same way differently, like
why the cornucopia instead

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:17.620 align:middle line:90%
of a platter under the fruit?

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have a good
answer for why that is.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.623 align:middle line:84%
But further research
clearly would be--

00:34:22.623 --> 00:34:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the fact that
they're even studying it

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:25.330 align:middle line:90%
is good.

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:26.413 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It is very good.

00:34:26.413 --> 00:34:30.219 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what about
between that and reality

00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:32.679 align:middle line:90%
shifts, timeline hopping?

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:35.710 align:middle line:84%
You say it's important to
be able to hop timelines.

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:36.969 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes.

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:39.489 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's very important to
be able to consciously know

00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:41.500 align:middle line:84%
by asking a question
like, how good can it get?

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.080 align:middle line:84%
By staying focused in
the midst of the chaos

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.150 align:middle line:84%
that you can bring about
good results for you,

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:49.010 align:middle line:84%
for your family,
for your loved ones.

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:50.199 align:middle line:90%
This is very powerful.

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's along the lines of
what Dr. Larry Dossey often

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.045 align:middle line:90%
talked about.

00:34:55.045 --> 00:34:57.670 align:middle line:84%
He was wonderful at presenting
that kind of information

00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:59.260 align:middle line:90%
in his books.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.810 align:middle line:90%
And he had that book "One Mind."

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's that idea
we are doing this

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:06.490 align:middle line:84%
because at higher levels
of conscious agency,

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:07.600 align:middle line:90%
we're capable of doing it.

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.080 align:middle line:90%
It's extremely important.

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And with all of the various
cataclysmic chaotic events

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.040 align:middle line:84%
happening in the world right
now, we have the ability,

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.040 align:middle line:90%
we have the tools.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.880 align:middle line:84%
The Mandela effect
gives us awareness

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.740 align:middle line:84%
that we can do
this collectively.

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:25.220 align:middle line:84%
We can do things
to change ourselves

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:30.480 align:middle line:84%
just the way that organisms are
instantly being able to evolve,

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.680 align:middle line:90%
which is remarkable.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:31.850 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you get into any deep
occult esoteric teaching,

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:38.840 align:middle line:84%
they will all go back
to the same thing,

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:40.010 align:middle line:90%
this world is thought--

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: It is thought.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --where
your thoughts go

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.280 align:middle line:84%
is the creation that we
are bathed in and live in.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.405 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Yes, and we can--

00:35:44.405 --> 00:35:44.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's that simple.

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:47.057 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: And we can be
scientists in our own lives,

00:35:47.057 --> 00:35:49.670 align:middle line:84%
practice it at home,
and try it out.

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:51.050 align:middle line:90%
Try how good can it get.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:52.550 align:middle line:84%
See what the day
is like that way.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:53.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I love that.

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And it gives a new meaning
to thought leaders.

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.315 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean people
who are showing on--

00:35:58.315 --> 00:35:59.720 align:middle line:90%
appearing on YouTube, right?

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Exactly.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It means if
you have the ability

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.520 align:middle line:84%
to have that clarity of
thought and coherence

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.190 align:middle line:84%
and vision a higher future,
you have the ability

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:09.620 align:middle line:84%
to help lead those who
are still developing that.

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:11.160 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's beautiful.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And on this note,
this is interesting.

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:16.790 align:middle line:84%
I have not seen the new release
of the movie "Snow White."

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:19.940 align:middle line:84%
I'll be curious when
I do see it to see--

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:21.380 align:middle line:90%
this is a common one, right?

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Right.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Share it with us.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: OK.

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can ask people what
they remember in that scene

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.970 align:middle line:84%
where the witch is
looking in the mirror

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:32.190 align:middle line:84%
and she's asking something,
something on the wall,

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.440 align:middle line:90%
who's the fairest of them all?

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mirror,
mirror on the wall.

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: That's
what I remember.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.970 align:middle line:90%
But now, it's never been that.

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:41.058 align:middle line:84%
It's only ever been magic
mirror on the wall--

00:36:41.058 --> 00:36:41.975 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nope, sorry.

00:36:41.975 --> 00:36:43.725 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: --who's the
fairest of them all.

00:36:43.725 --> 00:36:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nope.

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:48.620 align:middle line:84%
I want to see how the studio
handles that one, which

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.445 align:middle line:90%
one they go with.

00:36:49.445 --> 00:36:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: I'd like
to see that too.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:52.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because the collective
memory is more with mirror,

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:53.620 align:middle line:90%
mirror.

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:56.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'll be very curious to
see how they have whoever--

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:58.850 align:middle line:84%
the woman playing
that, Maleficent,

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:01.190 align:middle line:84%
how she plays that scene
and see what we end up with.

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:03.960 align:middle line:84%
It's just another kind of pop
thing that's fun to look at.

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.938 align:middle line:84%
So any final thoughts
before we say goodbye?

00:37:05.938 --> 00:37:07.730 align:middle line:84%
You've just been so
wonderfully articulate.

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:08.780 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Oh, thank you.

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:11.265 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think the key is
just keep asking questions.

00:37:11.265 --> 00:37:13.580 align:middle line:84%
So wherever people are, they
might fall apart to this,

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:14.380 align:middle line:90%
I'd say.

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:17.110 align:middle line:84%
If it seems confusing what we
talked about, watch it again,

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:19.900 align:middle line:84%
or like you suggested,
watch the other shows

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.250 align:middle line:90%
because this is a big topic.

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:23.350 align:middle line:10%
And when you first
are open to it

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:25.330 align:middle line:10%
and recognize, wait a
minute, those things

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.400 align:middle line:10%
are different for me
what's going on, then--

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.900 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: This is
the big enchilada.

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:29.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: This is big.

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:32.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a tool kit that humanity
is being given at this time

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:34.917 align:middle line:84%
to make it through the
best we've ever done.

00:37:34.917 --> 00:37:36.250 align:middle line:90%
And I know we're going to do it.

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:37.180 align:middle line:90%
How good can it get?

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.097 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Every major
seer throughout history

00:37:39.097 --> 00:37:40.430 align:middle line:90%
sees us going to a higher level.

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.915 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: It's going
to such a higher level.

00:37:40.915 --> 00:37:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
going to go there.

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:43.190 align:middle line:84%
But we can be part of
that and make it easier--

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.690 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: We are part of that.

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:45.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --or more difficult.

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>>LARSON: Thank you for
making it happen, too.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.168 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Cynthia.

00:37:48.168 --> 00:37:49.790 align:middle line:90%
I always love chatting with you.

00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:50.185 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:37:50.185 --> 00:37:50.985 align:middle line:90%
>>LARSON: Me too.

00:37:50.985 --> 00:37:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Always a fascinating
conversation with Cynthia Sue.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.110 align:middle line:84%
She writes her thoughts
on our evolving world

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:57.160 align:middle line:90%
on a regular basis.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:00.700 align:middle line:10%
You can connect with her work
through realityshifters.com.

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:03.370 align:middle line:10%
You can also catch up on my
previous interviews with her

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:05.290 align:middle line:10%
here on Gaia, as we
spoke of a moment ago.

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:07.450 align:middle line:10%
It might lay a nice
foundation for this talk.

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:09.490 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:10.870 align:middle line:10%
