>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Every now and then I

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.270 align:middle line:10%
come across a person
whose experience

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.400 align:middle line:10%
has such truth to me that
I simply have to meet them.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.840 align:middle line:10%
Joining us today, Darius
J. Wright is such a person.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.870 align:middle line:84%
His out-of-body experiences
are perhaps the most profoundly

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.510 align:middle line:84%
rendered I have ever
heard, reinforcing

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.610 align:middle line:84%
a great deal of what I've
learned over my own lifetime.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.670 align:middle line:84%
For those of you who are not
familiar with him just yet,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.610 align:middle line:90%
let's meet Darius.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.670 align:middle line:90%
Darius, welcome.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS J. WRIGHT:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So good
to see you here.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.570 align:middle line:84%
You came in from
Australia, which is where

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.655 align:middle line:90%
you've been living for a while.

00:00:47.655 --> 00:00:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yes.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So you're OK.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.640 align:middle line:90%
Your mind is here.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.980 align:middle line:90%
You're over your jet lag enough.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: Yeah no, I'm
totally, yeah, all good.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk--
let's just launch into you

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.500 align:middle line:84%
for those who don't know
you, your childhood a bit,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.470 align:middle line:84%
because all of this
started in your childhood.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.020 align:middle line:84%
But where it's leading to and
where it's led to is so needed.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.450 align:middle line:90%
So you're a little kid.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And you're a little
kid in Pennsylvania?

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.975 align:middle line:90%
Where were you--

00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: Yeah, born
in Pennsylvania.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.150 align:middle line:84%
So you're a little
kid in Pennsylvania.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.000 align:middle line:90%
And what starts happening?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.450 align:middle line:10%
>>DARIUS: Well, as
a child, you could

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.440 align:middle line:10%
say the dormant abilities
were always awake as a child.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.460 align:middle line:10%
I was coming out of my body not
realizing that I was coming out

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.940 align:middle line:10%
of my body, seeing
entities and beings inside

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.510 align:middle line:10%
of, well, in my room.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And over the years of
doing that as a child,

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.860 align:middle line:90%
I shut it down due to fear.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So all of this
paranormal activity,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.330 align:middle line:84%
I was like, OK, because I
was seeing so much stuff,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.820 align:middle line:84%
things were happening to
me, I just shut it down.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Fear is the number one way
to shut everything down

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.170 align:middle line:90%
within the body.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, what kind of creatures
were you seeing or beings?

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.930 align:middle line:84%
What array of things
through those young years?

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Well, they were--

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.430 align:middle line:84%
now what I know what
I know now, they

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.930 align:middle line:84%
were beings from
the other side that

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.160 align:middle line:84%
was communicating with me for
the purpose of why I came here.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't necessarily
understand that at the time,

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.470 align:middle line:90%
and because I'm a child.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What did
they look like?

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Human.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're humanoid?

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.712 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah, humanoid.

00:02:18.712 --> 00:02:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were what
you would call angelic.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so almost kind
of interdimensional beings.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Angels.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But they scared you?

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: Because the way
that they were presenting.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.120 align:middle line:84%
The way that they were
coming through was so--

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.580 align:middle line:84%
once you're leaving
your body, you

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.280 align:middle line:84%
are in a state of
sleep paralysis

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.730 align:middle line:84%
and your body's pretty much shut
down very, very aggressively,

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.530 align:middle line:90%
you could say.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we're going
to get into that quite a bit

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.700 align:middle line:84%
because that seems to be a
common phenomenon with OBE

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.680 align:middle line:84%
experience--
out-of-body experiences.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.900 align:middle line:90%
And I want to know--

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.650 align:middle line:84%
I know you go deeper into
it than a lot of people do,

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.550 align:middle line:90%
so that makes sense.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.680 align:middle line:84%
But when you were
a little kid, you

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.100 align:middle line:84%
weren't going out of
your body just yet.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.410 align:middle line:84%
They were just
coming in your room,

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.730 align:middle line:84%
or were you going
out of your body?

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: It was both.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.230 align:middle line:90%
It was both.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So it was a shifting
between both.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.823 align:middle line:84%
And I was unaware of it, because
once you're out of your body,

00:03:08.823 --> 00:03:10.490 align:middle line:84%
it's no different
from the physical body

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.610 align:middle line:90%
that you have right now.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's hard-- unless you
understand certain things,

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.580 align:middle line:84%
then you could clock
certain things.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.122 align:middle line:84%
Well, the longer
you're there, you'll

00:03:19.122 --> 00:03:20.460 align:middle line:90%
start to see a lot of things.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.540 align:middle line:84%
But it was between--
shifting between both some

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.360 align:middle line:84%
of them were coming
into my space as a child

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.610 align:middle line:84%
and I was viewing them,
physically seeing them

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.070 align:middle line:84%
while I was physically awake
and also coming out of my body

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.870 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.508 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
that gets you going.

00:03:33.508 --> 00:03:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And I thought we'd jump forward
a little bit because you just

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.320 align:middle line:84%
mentioned a little bit about
the sleep paralysis, which

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:84%
that seems to be a common
theme when people have--

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.160 align:middle line:84%
when they meet their
brethren on the other side.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.550 align:middle line:84%
So is it perhaps
necessary that the body

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.100 align:middle line:84%
goes into a state
of paralysis when

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.630 align:middle line:90%
we're having these encounters?

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Or I know we're
multi-dimensional, what part

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.545 align:middle line:90%
of us is paralyzing the body?

00:03:58.545 --> 00:04:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what it's like
from your perspective.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: So it's
not necessarily--

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.270 align:middle line:84%
there are some individuals
that can leave their body.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a rare occasion
where you're not

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.070 align:middle line:84%
entering sleep paralysis
and then you just leave.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.770 align:middle line:84%
This is where you'll
find individuals

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.310 align:middle line:84%
where they are in
a dream, in their

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.310 align:middle line:84%
exiting their dimensional
space into base reality.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.982 align:middle line:84%
Now sleep paralysis is
one of those things,

00:04:22.982 --> 00:04:24.440 align:middle line:84%
it's the initial
state-- well, it's

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.240 align:middle line:84%
the stage of where the body
is completely shut down.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.380 align:middle line:84%
So once you're there,
the electromagnetic field

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.980 align:middle line:84%
of the body that glues
the soul in is very low.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And this allows the
soul to easily exit.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's almost a
matter of necessity in a sense

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.290 align:middle line:90%
while you're learning this.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.640 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yes, it is.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.210 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the foundational
steps of learning

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.720 align:middle line:90%
how to do this at will.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.568 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:04:49.568 --> 00:04:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But it's scary.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.850 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
fear that you and your body

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.550 align:middle line:90%
experience because of fear.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: So it's both things.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.020 align:middle line:84%
So the body has a
natural instinct

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.860 align:middle line:84%
to want to adrenaline and
instincts of protection.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.610 align:middle line:90%
The same thing with the soul--

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.320 align:middle line:84%
well, it's not with the
soul, but when you come out

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.110 align:middle line:84%
of your body, one of the
things that's going to happen

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.600 align:middle line:84%
is your body isn't
necessarily going

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.060 align:middle line:90%
to want to let the soul go.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is where you get
this tug of war happening.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's all based on how
deeply shut down the body is.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.650 align:middle line:84%
So once you exit,
the thought forms

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.040 align:middle line:84%
that you think right now,
who you are, here right now,

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.220 align:middle line:90%
does not change.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So when you go into
the state already

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.640 align:middle line:84%
with fear or preset fears in
the past within your thoughts

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.143 align:middle line:84%
and you're popping out who
you are does not change,

00:05:42.143 --> 00:05:43.310 align:middle line:90%
and you bring that with you.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And when you come out
of your body with that,

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.860 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see
things within your field

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.460 align:middle line:90%
that you have thought about.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.722 align:middle line:84%
And this is where every
soul is presented with.

00:05:51.722 --> 00:05:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this, to me,
where it all is happening,

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.880 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing, the
whole game is happening.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.200 align:middle line:90%
It's so fascinating.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you mention
this, you say

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.290 align:middle line:84%
that the body doesn't
want to let the soul go

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.020 align:middle line:84%
because it must feel
a lot like a death

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.650 align:middle line:90%
experience or near death.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:07.940 align:middle line:90%
I think you talked about that.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.840 align:middle line:84%
I've heard you talk about
just get tired of feeling

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.780 align:middle line:90%
like you're dying.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.760 align:middle line:90%
It's scary.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.790 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about it.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.115 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: So the
out-of-body state

00:06:16.115 --> 00:06:17.990 align:middle line:84%
is no different from a
near-death experience.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a near-death experience
controlled is what I like

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.260 align:middle line:90%
to say, because you are--

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.980 align:middle line:84%
the same process of when you
die, the soul will leave.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, your
access to the other side.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.851 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with an
out-of-body state.

00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:36.850 align:middle line:84%
But people like to mix this
up with other terminology

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.013 align:middle line:84%
of astral projection or lucid
dreaming and things like that.

00:06:40.013 --> 00:06:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I wanted to ask
you about that because those

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.230 align:middle line:90%
are conflated a lot of times.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.050 align:middle line:90%
What is astral travel then?

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: Astral travel
is, you could say,

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.250 align:middle line:84%
a made-up term for accessing
your dimensional spaces

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.320 align:middle line:84%
because once you
leave the body, you

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.120 align:middle line:84%
will access your field,
your dimensional space.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.880 align:middle line:84%
This is, like I said
before, everything

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.882 align:middle line:84%
that you've thought about is in
that space and you materialize.

00:07:03.882 --> 00:07:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Everything that you
think of is instantly

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.660 align:middle line:90%
materialized in your field.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.040 align:middle line:84%
So when you have people that
have a strong belief system

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.780 align:middle line:90%
of let's just say, hell--

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.060 align:middle line:84%
let's just go to near-death
experience people.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.250 align:middle line:84%
They will cross
over through death,

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.940 align:middle line:84%
cross over and access
what they call hell

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.230 align:middle line:84%
in their dimensional space
because they're in such

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:25.980 align:middle line:90%
a state of fear and anxiety.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And to they say, they
get to the point where--

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.390 align:middle line:84%
why I've gotten-- where
I said, you know what?

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Over all the years of doing
this, I'm no longer afraid.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:34.915 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:07:34.915 --> 00:07:37.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't care anymore because
nothing had touched my soul.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.500 align:middle line:90%
And I stepped into that.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And when near-death
experience people also

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.940 align:middle line:84%
come to that
realization of like,

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.937 align:middle line:84%
whatever they believe in
to believe in, help me,

00:07:45.937 --> 00:07:48.520 align:middle line:84%
then all of a sudden, they pop
out of their dimensional space,

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.560 align:middle line:90%
they access all things again.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So the same applies
here as well.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what would
you call it then--

00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:00.370 align:middle line:84%
what facility or people using
by way of, say, remote viewing?

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: So remote
viewing is a--

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:09.860 align:middle line:84%
it's a form of this, but it's
not as what I'm talking about as

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.710 align:middle line:84%
well, because remote viewing,
you're just accessing--

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like you're
sending your mind out to survey.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yes.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I do that, but I
don't like leaving my body.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.170 align:middle line:84%
So with remote viewing,
that's what you're

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:22.440 align:middle line:90%
doing, what you just said.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.650 align:middle line:84%
But you're-- the body
isn't fully shut down.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.990 align:middle line:90%
It's still consciously awake.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So you're not necessarily really
viewing things as detailed

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.490 align:middle line:90%
as you can be--

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.782 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: If you're really out.

00:08:35.782 --> 00:08:37.073 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: If you're really out.

00:08:37.073 --> 00:08:38.789 align:middle line:84%
Because once you
interact with objects,

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:41.600 align:middle line:84%
once you're fully out of your
body, picking up a glass,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.750 align:middle line:84%
touching a table feels
more physical than actually

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.040 align:middle line:90%
touching it right here.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
think people probably

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.577 align:middle line:84%
have a hard time getting
their minds around it

00:08:49.577 --> 00:08:51.810 align:middle line:84%
that once you go into
your non-physical state,

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.680 align:middle line:84%
you feel more physical
and the world around you

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.740 align:middle line:90%
is more physical.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yes.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's one of the
biggest shocks for me

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.410 align:middle line:84%
when I was having them
or still have them.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:06.930 align:middle line:84%
But in the beginning of doing
this, when I was coming out,

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.460 align:middle line:90%
I was like, wait a second.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.640 align:middle line:90%
Like, this is no different.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.695 align:middle line:84%
And when I was touching things
like a door, the door was more,

00:09:15.695 --> 00:09:18.500 align:middle line:84%
you could say, it was
more dense in a sense

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.630 align:middle line:84%
because you're accessing
all of the array

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.140 align:middle line:90%
of the energy at that point.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Here, we think this
is real, because--

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're getting kind of
a flat one-dimensional sensual

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.940 align:middle line:84%
feeling about life,
it seems, compared

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.160 align:middle line:84%
to what you're saying about
it, where you're feeling

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.540 align:middle line:90%
all of the energies involved.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.873 align:middle line:90%
We're only feeling the material.

00:09:37.873 --> 00:09:38.673 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:09:38.673 --> 00:09:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, the physical
bodies could only

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.780 align:middle line:84%
access a certain
field of energy.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.290 align:middle line:84%
But when you're in your
soul, you access all of it.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's more real and physical
than it can ever be here.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.480 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That sounds fun, OK.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.060 align:middle line:90%
So let's go to Morocco.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.210 align:middle line:84%
So you've gone on,
and how old were you

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.710 align:middle line:90%
when you were in Morocco?

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.500 align:middle line:84%
So you're in your teens
or something, late teens?

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah, young.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:90%
19.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.830 align:middle line:84%
So now you're ready to--
you've had a lot of experience,

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.340 align:middle line:84%
you're comfortable
somewhat of with this,

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.460 align:middle line:90%
and you've seen a lot.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.443 align:middle line:84%
Now you find
yourself in Morocco.

00:10:13.443 --> 00:10:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And you're popping out
of your body every day,

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.750 align:middle line:84%
but you're not really
wanting to per se.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:19.560 align:middle line:90%
It's not by choice.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.960 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about your
Moroccan experience.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: So when
I was in Morocco,

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.650 align:middle line:84%
this was an uncontrolled
experience for me.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.315 align:middle line:84%
It was, you could say, the
reactivation of this, again.

00:10:32.315 --> 00:10:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: After
shutting it down.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.065 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: After
shutting it down.

00:10:35.065 --> 00:10:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And there was a point in time
in Morocco, every single night,

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm in sleep paralysis,
popping out of my body.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.178 align:middle line:84%
I was coming out, seeing all of
these things like that were--

00:10:45.178 --> 00:10:46.470 align:middle line:90%
it was just like, what is this?

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:47.270 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:48.680 align:middle line:90%
Interacting with certain things.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And I actually
begged it to stop,

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:54.528 align:middle line:84%
because when you go through the
process of leaving your body,

00:10:54.528 --> 00:10:56.570 align:middle line:84%
you go through the process
of feeling like you're

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:57.570 align:middle line:90%
dying every single time.

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.140 align:middle line:84%
There's no avoiding that
because you're actually

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.530 align:middle line:90%
leaving the physical body.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've done
that a couple of times.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:03.880 align:middle line:90%
I don't like the feeling.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.850 align:middle line:90%
It's hard.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:05.680 align:middle line:90%
It's harsh.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.777 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: So I didn't have
control over it in that time.

00:11:09.777 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's just like, OK, I'm
going to go to sleep tonight.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to leave my body
and go through this sensation

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:16.860 align:middle line:90%
all over again.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.370 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing things
in Morocco and out

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.980 align:middle line:84%
of my body, like the first
sensation of actually seeing

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.580 align:middle line:84%
dimensional space or through
portal access points,

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.370 align:middle line:84%
seeing how the
energy actually, we,

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.670 align:middle line:84%
as a soul, influence
everything around us.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Our energy signature literally
influences everything.

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:35.960 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so,
you said that--

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.910 align:middle line:84%
at one point, I was
listening to you,

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.960 align:middle line:84%
that you didn't really want
to leave the room initially.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.760 align:middle line:90%
It's like--

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: No, no, no.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --OK.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.117 align:middle line:84%
Let me just have a
safe space to explore.

00:11:48.117 --> 00:11:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the kind of things

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.950 align:middle line:84%
you explored in your room,
and then what happened when

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.480 align:middle line:90%
you chose to leave your room.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: OK, so when
I was in the room, one

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.270 align:middle line:84%
of the first things that I
remember interacting with

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:02.760 align:middle line:84%
is seeing all of the array
of colors that aren't here.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's colors
that I can't even--

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.900 align:middle line:84%
they're just different
forms of color there.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was me just
moving with my soul,

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:15.080 align:middle line:84%
interacting with my field, like
I could feel all of the colors,

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.080 align:middle line:84%
and it was all on the
walls and stuff like that.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And i would-- I
remember this one thing.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.915 align:middle line:84%
I would actually lift
up my skin of my soul,

00:12:21.915 --> 00:12:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and I would lift it up,
and then I would let it go.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
feel that energy just

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:27.550 align:middle line:90%
ripple through the entire room.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:29.595 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: And everything
starts to-- like

00:12:29.595 --> 00:12:30.678 align:middle line:90%
the colors and everything.

00:12:30.678 --> 00:12:33.160 align:middle line:84%
So there's other
parts of it too,

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.740 align:middle line:84%
where I remember
looking into mirrors

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:41.690 align:middle line:84%
and I was seeing the sort
of mandala or fractal effect

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.140 align:middle line:90%
that mirrors have.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what that
was back then, but fast forward

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:51.500 align:middle line:84%
into now, now doing this
at will, going into those,

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.150 align:middle line:84%
mirrors are dimensional
space access

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.710 align:middle line:84%
points for your
dimensional space,

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:57.320 align:middle line:84%
accessing potential time
events, which that's

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.468 align:middle line:90%
a way that you could do it.

00:12:58.468 --> 00:13:00.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a little trick that
the way that you could--

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, so that's why it
was used in mystical traditions

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.230 align:middle line:90%
throughout history.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:06.740 align:middle line:90%
An access point.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:07.215 align:middle line:90%
Oh, interesting.

00:13:07.215 --> 00:13:08.033 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:13:08.033 --> 00:13:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.520 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:15.360 align:middle line:84%
So then, ultimately, you
met a being named Celeste.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.964 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: Yeah, so
this was back at 16.

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 16.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.090 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about her and what
she was there for you, and--

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: OK.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So at 16 years old, this
was a point in my life

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:30.080 align:middle line:90%
where I had enough.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, you may think, and people
that are listening to this

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:84%
may think, well, how could you
have enough at 16 years old?

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, you need to go
back into my childhood

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.998 align:middle line:90%
and also where I was at 16.

00:13:43.998 --> 00:13:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was your
childhood like when you weren't

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:47.770 align:middle line:90%
in dream time and out-of-body?

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:53.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's-- my childhood is
very spiritually upbringing,

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:56.860 align:middle line:84%
so understanding all of these
things at a very young age.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lucky you.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And also understanding
how the system works,

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.410 align:middle line:84%
how the control
structures work here,

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:07.260 align:middle line:84%
Federal Reserve,
banking, et cetera.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.550 align:middle line:90%
So at 16 years old, I had--

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.840 align:middle line:84%
I understood all of
the control mechanism--

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.080 align:middle line:84%
control structures
within this realm,

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.330 align:middle line:84%
and also understanding
the spiritual warfare

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:19.720 align:middle line:90%
that's at place here as well.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.140 align:middle line:90%
I will get into that.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.920 align:middle line:84%
How did you learn
about these things?

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Was it from the
people around you?

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.040 align:middle line:84%
From your own research, your
guides, or a combination

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.010 align:middle line:90%
of all the above?

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: It was a
little bit of both.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:39.160 align:middle line:90%
Some of it was from my parents.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.232 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest of it was
from me just accessing, getting

00:14:42.232 --> 00:14:43.190 align:middle line:90%
information, and stuff.

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:45.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You could see what
was going on out in the field.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yes, yes.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So before
we go any further,

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.370 align:middle line:84%
just since we're
on that right now,

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.070 align:middle line:84%
because we were
talking about the fact

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:84%
that we're in a
frequency war of sorts.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't like the word
war-- challenge, struggle--

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.000 align:middle line:90%
but we're there.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And there are
controlling structures.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.928 align:middle line:84%
When you go out into
the construct, which

00:15:02.928 --> 00:15:04.220 align:middle line:90%
we're going to get to in a bit.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.705 align:middle line:90%
What does that look like?

00:15:05.705 --> 00:15:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: So, outside of
the construct, completely?

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: So when you get
out of this construct that

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:15.280 align:middle line:84%
has 12 realms, you are viewing
this from God's point of view

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.160 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.340 align:middle line:10%
So you can say God's
creation, this place

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.830 align:middle line:10%
was created, just like the
physical bodies were created,

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.240 align:middle line:10%
perfectly designed,
based off this construct.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So when you're looking at
it from the outside, you--

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:29.895 align:middle line:90%


00:15:29.895 --> 00:15:34.380 align:middle line:84%
There's images that I've
shared before, but it's--

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.810 align:middle line:84%
you see everything
at that point.

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:39.960 align:middle line:10%
The main construct, which is
here, when you have these--

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.440 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You show
images of that--

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.290 align:middle line:10%
I like that one you
have with the three

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.890 align:middle line:10%
images of the constructs here,
and the realms we're seeing,

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:48.010 align:middle line:10%
and then the dimensions.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:48.940 align:middle line:10%
I really like this.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:49.815 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:49.815 --> 00:15:54.430 align:middle line:84%
So then, you end up seeing our
construct that we're within,

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:58.260 align:middle line:84%
but then you also start to see
the vast array of constructs

00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.940 align:middle line:90%
all through.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.310 align:middle line:84%
I just say God shelves
stacked on God's shelves.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:02.640 align:middle line:10%
And--

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.430 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Universes.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:04.513 align:middle line:10%
>>DARIUS: Yeah, universes.

00:16:04.513 --> 00:16:07.620 align:middle line:10%
People use terminology
like worlds.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:11.070 align:middle line:10%
But they're just different
creations, creations based off

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:15.180 align:middle line:10%
individual souls wanting to
create due to their own soul

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:19.290 align:middle line:10%
expression, wanting to create
something that they love.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:20.400 align:middle line:90%
And that's basically--

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.525 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you look
at it from that conflict

00:16:22.525 --> 00:16:25.140 align:middle line:84%
point of view, and you look
at Earth and the construct

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.640 align:middle line:84%
that we're all in right now,
because we're all sensing this,

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.825 align:middle line:84%
everybody can feel like, no,
I'm not buying it anymore.

00:16:30.825 --> 00:16:32.200 align:middle line:84%
Everyone watching
this has gotten

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.370 align:middle line:84%
to the point where saying
I'm not buying it anymore.

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:37.270 align:middle line:84%
What's that look like when you
looked at it from the outside?

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: Well, now, here,
we're in such a great deception.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.830 align:middle line:84%
It's this place with
the history is a lie.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:49.330 align:middle line:84%
The information of what this
place is and who we actually are

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:50.230 align:middle line:90%
is a lie.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you take
a look at how they

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.350 align:middle line:84%
try to put so much people
in fear, fear of death.

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big one,
because why are you fearing

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.450 align:middle line:90%
things that don't exist.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:04.250 align:middle line:90%
So you put a soul into fear.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.839 align:middle line:84%
Fear is the number one
way to control the soul.

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.339 align:middle line:84%
It's also the number one way
to have dominion over your soul

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:10.310 align:middle line:90%
expression.

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So when souls are in such
a fear-based state here,

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.579 align:middle line:84%
automatically it cuts them off
from accessing all things again.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:21.339 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So would
you say that looking

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:27.000 align:middle line:84%
at it from that point of view,
it was an experiment by design

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.950 align:middle line:90%
or something that got hijacked?

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: It was a creation to
experience the extremes, yes.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.940 align:middle line:90%
So this was created for--

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:41.800 align:middle line:84%
the purpose of this has
been fulfilled many times,

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:46.000 align:middle line:90%
what people call duality.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.230 align:middle line:84%
So you don't necessarily
get an experience like this

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:52.700 align:middle line:84%
throughout all of the other
constructs in creation,

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.930 align:middle line:84%
because this is the only
one where you forget who you

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:57.170 align:middle line:90%
are when you enter the space.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:58.770 align:middle line:90%
That's a big deal.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:00.895 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: Well over there
you don't, because you're

00:18:00.895 --> 00:18:03.070 align:middle line:84%
in your soul, your soul
is physical, more physical

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.220 align:middle line:90%
than the physical body.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:07.150 align:middle line:84%
So when you enter different
places there, constructs,

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:10.360 align:middle line:84%
creations, you're entering
it with full remembrance

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.770 align:middle line:84%
of who you are, the
divinity of who you are.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And you're not necessarily
being born and dying.

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's very much
this kind of matrix construct--

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yes, yes.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.352 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --where you have to
incarnate into a physical body,

00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and you're really not free to
see yourself and everyone else

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.580 align:middle line:84%
until you're out of the
physical body again.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:26.710 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: No.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, the physical
body is the veil.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.470 align:middle line:90%
That is the veil.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:30.512 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The veil, yeah.

00:18:30.512 --> 00:18:32.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: So when
people think about,

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:35.060 align:middle line:84%
I want to pierce the
veil, it's out here.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.490 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the body,
because once you pierce

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:40.200 align:middle line:84%
this physical body
through leaving the body,

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.990 align:middle line:84%
then you'll quickly realize
if you have no fear,

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.140 align:middle line:84%
then you access all
of it all over again.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.390 align:middle line:90%
You stand for the second time.

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, And you
just said that we've

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.160 align:middle line:84%
been through this dance
a number of times.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.370 align:middle line:84%
We've completed the
duality dance on Earth

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:53.520 align:middle line:90%
a number of times.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.320 align:middle line:84%
So why does it keep
recreating itself?

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Why do we keep recreating it?

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: So it's the
cycles, cycles of time.

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.820 align:middle line:84%
This construct has fixed
event markers, cycles.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, this has-- you
go back in history,

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:12.732 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that it's the great
wars, even the present day,

00:19:12.732 --> 00:19:14.440 align:middle line:84%
we're still having
wars even though we're

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:19.210 align:middle line:84%
living on the destruction of the
old world, which was everything

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.480 align:middle line:90%
was open at that point.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's just basically repeating
of certain cycles of time.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, the looping
of this, I would

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:37.060 align:middle line:84%
say, due to the control over
souls in their not-knowingness,

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:37.860 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:40.028 align:middle line:90%
We simply-- we don't know.

00:19:40.028 --> 00:19:41.070 align:middle line:90%
We don't know who we are.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:42.153 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what we are.

00:19:42.153 --> 00:19:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's definitely
kept from us,

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.705 align:middle line:84%
I think, by design
and ignorance both.

00:19:46.705 --> 00:19:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Absolutely.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:51.120 align:middle line:84%
So now we look at
this construct,

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.760 align:middle line:84%
and we see this image
where you're looking in--

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.820 align:middle line:84%
you can look into the
construct, and there are so

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.330 align:middle line:84%
many different
realities within it.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And you see these-- some of them
are kind of like pools and such.

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:06.990 align:middle line:84%
But then you see
these realms, and I'm

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:11.580 align:middle line:84%
very interested in the realms
within our particular matrix,

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.920 align:middle line:84%
because people are accessing
higher and lower realms.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: Yeah,
so this would be--

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:17.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:21.900 align:middle line:90%
So to-- this realm is realm 1.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.900 align:middle line:84%
This is the lowest realm within
this entirety of this construct.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.133 align:middle line:84%
Now, you could access, you
could say lower realms,

00:20:27.133 --> 00:20:28.550 align:middle line:84%
but what you would
really be doing

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:30.410 align:middle line:84%
is you would be accessing
your own dimensional space

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:32.450 align:middle line:84%
at that point, because this
is the lowest that it gets.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:33.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I see
what you're saying.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So the construct you saw,
the physical is at the bottom

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.830 align:middle line:90%
and the realms go up.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.260 align:middle line:84%
But there are dimensions
within those realms,

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.560 align:middle line:84%
and you're embodying the
frequency of those dimensions ,

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.365 align:middle line:84%
and they can be
darker or lighter.

00:20:44.365 --> 00:20:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah, yeah.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: This is what
everybody will experience

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.780 align:middle line:84%
based off their fear,
if they have any,

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.630 align:middle line:84%
they'll experience
their own hell.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Because they're experiencing
their field, like I said before.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:21:00.530 align:middle line:84%
But this, we have a total
of 12 here, 12 realms.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Supposed to be-- the
13 is the container

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.620 align:middle line:84%
of the whole--
containing at all.

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.890 align:middle line:84%
This is where, originally,
we look at the calendars.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.520 align:middle line:84%
12 months, it's
supposed to be 13.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.458 align:middle line:84%
Everything is supposed
to be based off 13.

00:21:12.458 --> 00:21:13.500 align:middle line:90%
You even look at the DNA.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.530 align:middle line:84%
We have two But it's
supposed to be 12.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Originally, it's
supposed to be 13

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.940 align:middle line:84%
because the bodies are perfectly
created to access and connect

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.160 align:middle line:84%
to all of these spaces
because it's all

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.900 align:middle line:84%
imprinted within the
physical body as well.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:29.610 align:middle line:84%
So you could also say, going
in a different direction

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:32.820 align:middle line:84%
as well, the physical
body is limited

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:37.110 align:middle line:84%
because it's pre-created to only
access the construct of that

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:38.520 align:middle line:90%
which it was created for.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.450 align:middle line:90%
But the soul is not.

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:42.100 align:middle line:84%
The soul cannot be
measured, cannot be touched.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Infinite

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what is--
let's go through the realms

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.110 align:middle line:84%
and what people
experience once they're

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:51.300 align:middle line:84%
able to pierce through
the veil of the body,

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.020 align:middle line:90%
and explore into other realms.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get to
level 5, which is where you

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:57.900 align:middle line:90%
say what we call heaven exists.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to go beyond that.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:03.120 align:middle line:84%
So what-- give us a
flavor of the first--

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.500 align:middle line:84%
the next realms that
we would experience.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.670 align:middle line:90%
What would they be like?

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: So, well, here,
realm 1, heaven is 5.

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Heaven is still
within this construct.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.660 align:middle line:84%
You have the angelic
realms, which is realm 7.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of people,
7 is the angel numbers.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.020 align:middle line:84%
You have also the
realm of Eden, which

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.840 align:middle line:84%
is, you actually start to see
them when you access things.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.260 align:middle line:84%
The biblical side of
things are distorted,

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.930 align:middle line:84%
but there is a
lot of truth there

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:34.710 align:middle line:84%
because most of the
texts and the tablets

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:37.650 align:middle line:84%
all through history that
have been distorted,

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:41.640 align:middle line:84%
it's telling you a story
of the true history

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.940 align:middle line:90%
and also fables as well.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.560 align:middle line:84%
There are a couple versions,
even in the Old Testament,

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.930 align:middle line:84%
they're right side by side
in two different stories.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:54.300 align:middle line:84%
So then, we have
the realm of Eden.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.133 align:middle line:84%
You have realm 7, which
is the angelic realm.

00:22:58.133 --> 00:22:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And then you also
have what people

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:05.040 align:middle line:84%
call the God, what people think
God is, God's throne, realm 9,

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:12.340 align:middle line:84%
but it's just a race of you
could say beings there that are,

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:18.160 align:middle line:84%
you could say the Olympian type,
God-like stature of beings.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.590 align:middle line:84%
You have realm 12,
which is ancients,

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:22.570 align:middle line:90%
which is what I've come to.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And you have realm 2, which
is also part of the galactics.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Galactics
would be realm 2,

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:30.150 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people,
I say, they're in touch

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:31.800 align:middle line:90%
with Galactic Federation.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And we do a lot on the
subject of UFOs and ETs,

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:36.340 align:middle line:90%
so that would be realm 2.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yes.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:37.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.103 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: Based off
of access realm 2.

00:23:39.103 --> 00:23:41.234 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
realm 3 and 4?

00:23:41.234 --> 00:23:44.387 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: I don't want to share
necessarily those, as yet.

00:23:44.387 --> 00:23:45.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.170 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: Just
because it's still--

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:47.970 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's still brewing
a bit, or hard to articulate?

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: It's certain things
I want to make sure is 100%

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:56.730 align:middle line:90%
before I share.

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I can appreciate that.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:58.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's just
kick on to heaven, then.

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:01.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, let's
talk about heaven.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.750 align:middle line:84%
So heaven, heaven
is within here.

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:07.830 align:middle line:84%
So when people
transition and cross

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:10.080 align:middle line:84%
over or through controlled
out-of-body state,

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.790 align:middle line:84%
because this could all be
accessed here right now,

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:15.882 align:middle line:90%
but heaven is a place here.

00:24:15.882 --> 00:24:17.340 align:middle line:10%
There's many
different-- this where

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.382 align:middle line:10%
you get there's many
different mansions in heaven

00:24:19.382 --> 00:24:22.510 align:middle line:10%
because it pretty much is
that, it's the heavenly realms,

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:10%
heavenly creation.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:27.360 align:middle line:10%
And in this place you
have all the cathedrals,

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.710 align:middle line:10%
you have also the
used tablets as well.

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:32.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is the first
time that I was actually

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:34.500 align:middle line:84%
shown in the heavenly realms
where they actually have

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.700 align:middle line:90%
forms of organic technology.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.880 align:middle line:10%
You can say a phone,
tablet, they actually

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.640 align:middle line:10%
access the whole
database of records.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.880 align:middle line:10%
And you can access also the
heavenly realm records as well

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.500 align:middle line:10%
based off individual
souls, and et cetera.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.900 align:middle line:10%
But there's many records
all within this construct.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.037 align:middle line:10%
You have the halls
of Amenti, records,

00:24:52.037 --> 00:24:54.370 align:middle line:10%
you have the constructor
records, the universal records,

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:55.360 align:middle line:10%
et cetera.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So where does
AI fit into all this?

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: AI is--

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.322 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:03.322 --> 00:25:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If we're
talking thought,

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.150 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking creation,
and we're talking,

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:08.900 align:middle line:84%
we know that it's
throughout the universe.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.730 align:middle line:90%
It's been here before.

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Where does AI fit into
this, our creation of AI.

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: OK, so the version
of AI that we are using now

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:22.790 align:middle line:84%
is not necessarily
organic technology.

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: But there, they're
tapping into what people also

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.700 align:middle line:84%
say is the ether, the
information that is always

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.240 align:middle line:84%
there and always present
within the field of everything.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, AI here is
a very distorted,

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:39.620 align:middle line:84%
because as you come down
through the layers to realm 1,

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:41.870 align:middle line:84%
everything becomes
much more distorted.

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:45.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting a very
distorted layer of AI

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:48.334 align:middle line:90%
here, which is not the--

00:25:48.334 --> 00:25:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not
serving in many ways.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:50.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: No.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.850 align:middle line:84%
It's actually cutting people
off physically from what the--

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The organic AI?

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: I would actually
say the organic technology

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.330 align:middle line:84%
that they have within them
because it's not necessarily AI.

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Because it's more of
your soul has access

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:08.868 align:middle line:90%
to all of the information.

00:26:08.868 --> 00:26:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's organic.

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:10.870 align:middle line:90%
That's not artificial.

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, you were
talking earlier about mind,

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:20.200 align:middle line:84%
you can see everything once
you get out of the body.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:25.580 align:middle line:84%
OK, you have said
that you can actually

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:29.230 align:middle line:84%
kind of walk into an experience,
other people's thought forms.

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that
and how powerful the thought

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.530 align:middle line:84%
form that we create,
and the incidental ones

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:39.710 align:middle line:84%
we're reinforcing a
million times a day are.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: OK, so what we think,
every thought that we have,

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:48.770 align:middle line:84%
doesn't just vanish
into nowhere that is

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.850 align:middle line:90%
within your individual field.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:54.050 align:middle line:84%
This is where it goes
into, you will always--

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:55.600 align:middle line:84%
like I've said in
this before, you

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.570 align:middle line:84%
will always face yourself
and meet yourself.

00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:59.360 align:middle line:84%
You will see the
things of what you've

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.520 align:middle line:90%
created through your own field.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you're
out of your body,

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:09.150 align:middle line:84%
you're not necessarily by
intentionally wanting to do it,

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.530 align:middle line:90%
but it's just what is.

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:11.350 align:middle line:90%
It's what you see.

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:14.240 align:middle line:84%
So you come out of your body,
you also see everybody's field.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And it just so happens to be
within their field is their--

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thought forms.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:19.533 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: --thought forms.

00:27:19.533 --> 00:27:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And when you tap
into that field,

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:25.260 align:middle line:84%
you can actually see their
thought forms manifest it with--

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.470 align:middle line:90%
you could interact with it.

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:27.510 align:middle line:90%
It's physical.

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:29.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a physical thing that
you could touch, taste,

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:33.006 align:middle line:84%
feel and you could interact
with everything that they've--

00:27:33.006 --> 00:27:34.510 align:middle line:90%
their most desires.

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:35.385 align:middle line:90%
You could say their--

00:27:35.385 --> 00:27:37.625 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Their greatest desires
because they've been reinforced.

00:27:37.625 --> 00:27:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:38.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that would
lead to the subject

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.560 align:middle line:84%
of being able to pierce
into the future a bit,

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.270 align:middle line:84%
because it would
seem that reinforced

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:47.430 align:middle line:84%
thought forms
ultimately concretize

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:48.700 align:middle line:90%
into this dimensional reality.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.900 align:middle line:84%
So thoughts and time are
very closely mirrored

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.640 align:middle line:84%
together because the more that
someone thinks of something,

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.090 align:middle line:84%
they create that possible
time event to walk down.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So have you been
able to look into future events

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.190 align:middle line:84%
when you're out of body
and seeing thought forms.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:07.362 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: Yeah, I've seen the
potential time, thoughts forms,

00:28:07.362 --> 00:28:09.820 align:middle line:84%
like I've said already, but
I've seen potential time within

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:10.990 align:middle line:90%
my field, things that--

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:14.020 align:middle line:84%
I was coming out of my body,
and I would see things play out

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.610 align:middle line:90%
in the out-of-body state.

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was viewing
it and I was like,

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.400 align:middle line:90%
am I seeing thought or time?

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until I
started to understand

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:24.980 align:middle line:84%
how to distinguish
between the two,

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:28.020 align:middle line:84%
when you start to access time,
things start to extend and warp.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.240 align:middle line:84%
You actually feel the extension
and warping of things.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, OK that's
what I'm accessing.

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:34.420 align:middle line:90%
It's time right there.

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And then I would see
things taking place.

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:39.350 align:middle line:90%
I would come back into my body.

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.350 align:middle line:84%
I would tell people
that I'm close to,

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:44.950 align:middle line:84%
this is going to happen,
or such and such is

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:46.990 align:middle line:84%
going to walk in this
room and they're going

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:48.680 align:middle line:90%
to talk to you about a TV show.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.683 align:middle line:84%
And I was just like,
tell me if it happens?

00:28:50.683 --> 00:28:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And I would wait
in the back yard.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.587 align:middle line:84%
And verbatim, played out
exactly how I saw it.

00:28:54.587 --> 00:28:56.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It would
make perfect sense.

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:58.130 align:middle line:84%
If you're in the field
of thought forms,

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.220 align:middle line:84%
you know exactly
what's being created

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:05.150 align:middle line:84%
by every single individual on
this planet at any given moment

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:09.000 align:middle line:84%
If you chose to go there
and had proximity to them.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.820 align:middle line:84%
We're all in a
state of creation,

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.500 align:middle line:84%
and it's all following
our desire and thoughts.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.750 align:middle line:90%
Which is interesting.

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: I just want to
say, too, so it's not--

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:22.980 align:middle line:84%
the time side of things,
I've accessed a--

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:27.760 align:middle line:84%
mainly due to my own personal
field, my own personal--

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.400 align:middle line:84%
I've access to a lot of
that, my potentialities.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.740 align:middle line:84%
They don't always
play out verbatim,

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.920 align:middle line:84%
but majority of the
time the stronger

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.420 align:middle line:84%
that vision comes in
the out-of-body state,

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.280 align:middle line:90%
the more physical that is.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:43.290 align:middle line:84%
It's because it's very--
it's a very probable timeline

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:44.860 align:middle line:90%
to happen to occur.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:49.500 align:middle line:84%
But at even the
major event markers,

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.430 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
world event timelines.

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:52.450 align:middle line:90%
I haven't really--

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, not those so much.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:54.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
if you're seeing--

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:58.210 align:middle line:84%
us people, as we're constantly
in a state of creation.

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:02.470 align:middle line:84%
But then there is always
the interface with others,

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:04.110 align:middle line:90%
the will of others.

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Things that almost appear
to be accidental at times.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And we can have a
very strong creation.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.520 align:middle line:84%
We can get by in
all the way around,

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.210 align:middle line:84%
and then, boom, someone
falls off a ladder

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:16.180 align:middle line:90%
and breaks their back.

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And they were the key
person in that endeavor,

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.550 align:middle line:84%
and that's now delayed
and may never happen.

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:24.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in that way,
you can see that you

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.440 align:middle line:90%
can manifest a good degree--

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:30.040 align:middle line:84%
to a good degree with your
own desire and thought,

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:34.120 align:middle line:84%
but not to be upset if it
doesn't come about because we

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.270 align:middle line:90%
operate with each other.

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:36.350 align:middle line:90%
It's not just us.

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:37.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is also where it goes
into, you need, when doing this,

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:42.565 align:middle line:90%
to stand in integrity, always.

00:30:42.565 --> 00:30:43.365 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Always.

00:30:43.365 --> 00:30:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: Yeah, because it's--
you can't necessarily judge

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:52.030 align:middle line:84%
things that you see from another
person because the creation

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:54.890 align:middle line:84%
of this, of all things, is in
a state of unconditional love.

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And you can't have unconditional
love with a judgment.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:57.910 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:30:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
what my guides keep

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:01.550 align:middle line:84%
saying too, that that
one thing is really key.

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:05.740 align:middle line:84%
If we could just stop looking
at each other with judgment,

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.900 align:middle line:84%
the quality of the
frequency of this place

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.640 align:middle line:90%
would shift almost overnight.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, within a second.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:11.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:13.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's-- yeah.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.390 align:middle line:84%
If individuals stepped into
that fully and completely,

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:19.510 align:middle line:84%
they would quickly
realize that love

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:22.300 align:middle line:84%
has been so perversed into
thinking that it's just

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.510 align:middle line:90%
a submissive passive state--

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: --when love
is a weapon as well,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:32.230 align:middle line:84%
it could pierce through all
barriers, barriers, all things.

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:33.800 align:middle line:90%
It can move mountains.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.267 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: That's the
power of true love.

00:31:36.267 --> 00:31:37.460 align:middle line:90%
It creates everything.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:40.180 align:middle line:84%
It's the reason why we're
sitting here right now,

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.370 align:middle line:84%
it's due to the
creation of love--

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:43.550 align:middle line:90%
Or not the creation of love.

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:44.350 align:middle line:90%
Due to--

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:45.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The existence of love

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: --existence
of love, yes.

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A famous
physicist once called

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:52.750 align:middle line:84%
love the universal solvent, that
everything is bathed within,

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:55.990 align:middle line:84%
throughout the universes
and all the constructs.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was a really,
kind of, lovely way to put it.

00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:03.850 align:middle line:84%
So with Earth-- thank you for
explaining it to the extent

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:05.390 align:middle line:84%
you have about the
various realms.

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
dimensional frequencies

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.950 align:middle line:84%
and our own experiences
and feelings

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:12.790 align:middle line:84%
within each of those realms
with each of these areas

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:14.360 align:middle line:90%
that you talked about earlier.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's go outside and--

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.380 align:middle line:90%
yes, please.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: Let me just say this
to maybe clear up this as well.

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:26.700 align:middle line:90%
The dimensional spaces are--

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.810 align:middle line:84%
let me actually
say it like this.

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:31.920 align:middle line:84%
So when you're in base reality
on the other side, fully outside

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.320 align:middle line:84%
of the construct, seeing all
of the constructs stacked

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.440 align:middle line:84%
on God shelves,
it's sort of like,

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:39.370 align:middle line:90%
imagine like you're in a city.

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:42.893 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say, New York
City, or a town, or whatever,

00:32:42.893 --> 00:32:44.310 align:middle line:84%
and you're walking
down the street

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.790 align:middle line:90%
and you see all these buildings.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:47.070 align:middle line:90%
Those are constructs.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you walk
into those buildings,

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:52.575 align:middle line:90%
then you're entering a--

00:32:52.575 --> 00:32:56.010 align:middle line:84%
you can enter in multiple
different realms,

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:58.720 align:middle line:84%
so that you're entering
a construct, a realm.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, the dimensional spaces
are like the little rooms

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.270 align:middle line:90%
within that house.

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:04.570 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:08.425 align:middle line:84%
And so when you pop back
out into the road again,

00:33:08.425 --> 00:33:10.800 align:middle line:84%
the sidewalks you're walking
down, you're in base reality

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.130 align:middle line:84%
again, able to pop into
different constructs based off

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:15.660 align:middle line:84%
how many realms
that construct has,

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.412 align:middle line:84%
and the dimensional spaces based
off individual thought forms

00:33:18.412 --> 00:33:19.620 align:middle line:90%
that individual souls create.

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:20.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it makes sense.

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:22.505 align:middle line:84%
So someone could go into
a room and it's beautiful.

00:33:22.505 --> 00:33:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And another one goes in
and it's dark and ugly.

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So it's your creation.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:26.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yes.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:32.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now let's say-- and
thank you for clarifying that.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:35.360 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go outside of
this construct altogether.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And I would love for you to
share with us some of you've

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:43.240 align:middle line:84%
seen of other constructs
that have maybe

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.750 align:middle line:90%
progressed further along--

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.270 align:middle line:84%
that have progressed
further along

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:48.580 align:middle line:84%
than our current mindset
and understanding

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:51.560 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, and maybe some
that aren't as far along.

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Because to me, it's
always intriguing

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.970 align:middle line:90%
that space is a relative thing.

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:59.690 align:middle line:84%
There could be a universe right
here in the palm of my hands.

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:01.160 align:middle line:84%
There could be an
entire universe.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So tell us what it looks
like from your point of view,

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:06.340 align:middle line:84%
and also the most shocking
place you've ever been.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: So it's not
necessarily what--

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:12.020 align:middle line:84%
so once you're outside
of the construct,

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.150 align:middle line:84%
completely, fully
and completely,

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:17.409 align:middle line:84%
it's not necessarily that
all of the other constructs

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:20.230 align:middle line:84%
are more advanced than
we are further along.

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Because as soon as
you're outside, you're--

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:26.969 align:middle line:84%
everything is, you could
say at the same level

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:28.889 align:middle line:84%
because you're popping
into different spaces

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:32.580 align:middle line:84%
for an experience of
pleasure at that point.

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:36.570 align:middle line:84%
But here is a place where we
experience the absolute extremes

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:37.500 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.667 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily, like I
said before, you could get--

00:34:39.667 --> 00:34:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and you can't get anywhere
else like you do here.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:42.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: So the other places
that I've been within here

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:48.877 align:middle line:84%
and also out, like I've
said, is also the realms.

00:34:48.877 --> 00:34:49.710 align:middle line:90%
I've access to that.

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:52.659 align:middle line:84%
I've seen all of the different
realms within this construct.

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:54.219 align:middle line:84%
But then outside
of it, completely,

00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:57.180 align:middle line:84%
I've been taken back to
the beginning of things,

00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:59.770 align:middle line:84%
from 16 years old,
the first time,

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:02.530 align:middle line:84%
and also three other times as
well, being shown the void,

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:06.090 align:middle line:84%
the black space, which is
a the-- lot of people think

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:07.410 align:middle line:90%
darkness is--

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:14.130 align:middle line:84%
or the void is the black space
is a place that is a secondary

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:17.080 align:middle line:84%
thing or it's-- but it's
actually the birth of all

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:17.880 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Primal, everything
comes from there.

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: Absolutely because it
contains all-- you could say,

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.710 align:middle line:90%
it contains all the color.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:26.903 align:middle line:84%
Because even when
you look into this,

00:35:26.903 --> 00:35:28.570 align:middle line:84%
when you look into
creation-- let's just

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:30.380 align:middle line:84%
go into the biblical
side of things.

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:33.630 align:middle line:84%
They say God created this
place, said, let there be light.

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:34.970 align:middle line:90%
Light is always secondary.

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:36.790 align:middle line:84%
It's always a
secondary thing, even

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:38.770 align:middle line:90%
in the spoken word and the will.

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Even right now, when
you close your eyes,

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.500 align:middle line:84%
you're back into a
version of the void.

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
to imagine something,

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:49.400 align:middle line:90%
you birth light into creation.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.760 align:middle line:84%
So we're actually the
birthers of light, you see?

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, Yes.

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.120 align:middle line:90%
I actually love the void.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.620 align:middle line:84%
I've gone there a
couple of times.

00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And I love the everything
and nothing, pure stillness

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:02.950 align:middle line:84%
and silence, but
everything is present.

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:04.580 align:middle line:90%
So, so beautiful.

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:06.200 align:middle line:90%
So we've got the void.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And then we have other
places where you're playing

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:10.070 align:middle line:90%
without so much extreme.

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:14.320 align:middle line:84%
What kind of races
have you run into?

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Different kinds of
interplanetary races

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:20.630 align:middle line:84%
out there,
Inter-dimensional races.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: So a lot of
the different races,

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:29.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start off just
within this construct first.

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going
to progress out.

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Now within here, this
construct, 12 planes

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.680 align:middle line:90%
of existence, 12 realms.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.180 align:middle line:90%
We have everything here.

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is in
the history is true.

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.880 align:middle line:84%
You have the dragons, you have
the Whites, you have the Greys,

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:52.820 align:middle line:84%
you have the angels, you
have the Seraphims, the gods,

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:58.010 align:middle line:84%
all of that stuff is these
beings still exist here,

00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:00.740 align:middle line:84%
even the, what
people call Anunnaki,

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:06.360 align:middle line:84%
which is part of the-- a small
part of also the halls of Amenti

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.160 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Those race of beings,
all of them are here.

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And you have an array of
also the creatures here

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:18.100 align:middle line:84%
that are talked about, like the
mermaids and stuff like that.

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:20.960 align:middle line:84%
This was all taking place
here in a period of time.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Everything was open in a period
of time, where all of the realms

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:27.290 align:middle line:84%
were interacting all together
within this construct.

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:29.740 align:middle line:84%
This is where you get
heaven coming to Earth,

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:31.823 align:middle line:90%
or the war in heaven, et cetera.

00:37:31.823 --> 00:37:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Because all of it was
taking place here.

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you step out
of this place completely,

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:42.250 align:middle line:84%
then we are just souls
operating in our bodies

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:44.960 align:middle line:84%
at that point to pop
into other experiences,

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:48.430 align:middle line:84%
to have an experience based
off us wanting to experience

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:49.310 align:middle line:90%
something different.

00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:51.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what would
be one of the most

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:56.180 align:middle line:84%
delightful experiences you've
had outside of this construct?

00:37:56.180 --> 00:38:01.047 align:middle line:84%
If that's a fair way to ask
it, is it say interesting?

00:38:01.047 --> 00:38:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: All right.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So the most peaceful
thing outside of here

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:07.270 align:middle line:84%
was the void, going
back there, because it

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:11.380 align:middle line:84%
was a place where your soul
truly, you can say, rests.

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:16.460 align:middle line:84%
It's like you are in a constant
state of access to all things,

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.220 align:middle line:90%
but in peace at the same time.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:22.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily the--
you can say it's bliss,

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:23.830 align:middle line:90%
but it's more you're--

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: More quiet than bliss.

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:27.953 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: You're just
completely in balance.

00:38:27.953 --> 00:38:30.662 align:middle line:84%
Like everything's
in balance, so yeah.

00:38:30.662 --> 00:38:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I'm kind
of curious about-- if we

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.310 align:middle line:90%
have this crazy construct here.

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:36.410 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be
really interesting,

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:38.920 align:middle line:90%
strange stuff elsewhere, too.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yes, there is, yeah.

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:43.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- once you
come out of this place,

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:45.970 align:middle line:84%
there are so many
different experiences

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:47.462 align:middle line:90%
to be had outside of here.

00:38:47.462 --> 00:38:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Have you ever had--

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:50.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, have you had some
that were just so completely

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.870 align:middle line:84%
different than what we have
access to here at this time?

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: Well, you end up
creating spaces for yourself

00:38:57.010 --> 00:39:00.650 align:middle line:84%
or going into other
people's soul's experiences

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:02.180 align:middle line:90%
to experience whatever it is.

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's just have an example as
you want a realm full of dogs,

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:11.960 align:middle line:90%
or something, a dog realm.

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, then your soul
could create that

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:17.150 align:middle line:84%
through its will and desire to
create it on the other side,

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:22.370 align:middle line:84%
and create that construct for a
specific template of experience

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:25.010 align:middle line:90%
for the soul to have to--

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in that sense,
it's almost the only limitation

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:30.045 align:middle line:84%
is our imagination
of what's possible.

00:39:30.045 --> 00:39:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Absolutely.

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:34.023 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So anything that we
desire that we can think of--

00:39:34.023 --> 00:39:35.315 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: You could experience.

00:39:35.315 --> 00:39:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --we can experience,
once we leave the body?

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yes.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we
could be any kind

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:43.350 align:middle line:84%
of creature, any kind of
race of other creatures?

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:46.160 align:middle line:84%
We could be winged creatures
or any creatures we want?

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: So, well,
yes because the--

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:55.840 align:middle line:90%
your soul is not controlled.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Who you are, the essence of you
is an infinite creator being.

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And so, people need to
understand that the universe

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:09.820 align:middle line:90%
does not dictate consciousness.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:12.940 align:middle line:84%
That consciousness
dictates the universe.

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you understand
that, then you

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:17.410 align:middle line:84%
understand that you, your
consciousness, your soul

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:19.330 align:middle line:90%
is the dictator of all things.

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Same with every
other soul as well.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it goes into
honoring every single soul

00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:26.630 align:middle line:90%
for their soul expression.

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Because you are-- each soul
expresses their uniqueness.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And we're not even like
the other in that aspect

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.922 align:middle line:90%
because every soul is so unique.

00:40:35.922 --> 00:40:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like a fingerprint.

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah, there we go.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're so--

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Perfect.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're so unique.

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:43.220 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at
the entire thing,

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:45.430 align:middle line:84%
you look at the
universes that contain

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:48.400 align:middle line:84%
these constructs, the
bookshelves of God,

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.858 align:middle line:90%
as you call it.

00:40:49.858 --> 00:40:51.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: Constructs
on God's shelves, yes.

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Constructs
on God's shelves, yes.

00:40:55.230 --> 00:41:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Do you see uber-consciousness
as a type of god

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:04.690 align:middle line:84%
or a series of
god-like creators?

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Or are we all a portion of that
and co-creating at all times

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:09.950 align:middle line:90%
with it?

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Seems like there's a hierarchy
to the level of creations.

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: OK, so
there's a hierarchy

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:20.200 align:middle line:90%
here in between the 12 realms.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.990 align:middle line:84%
But once you're
outside, and let's just

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:24.360 align:middle line:84%
say outside of all
things again, back--

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.870 align:middle line:84%
just back in the
beginning, there's

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:29.260 align:middle line:90%
not necessarily a hierarchy.

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:32.490 align:middle line:84%
It's just always in a
state of being, your soul.

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, to go back to
what your question was.

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:40.380 align:middle line:90%
Is there a singular God?

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.830 align:middle line:90%
Or are we all sort of gods?

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:42.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm doing another
interview tomorrow,

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:49.200 align:middle line:84%
and the subject of
intelligent design comes in.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.970 align:middle line:84%
What is that intelligence, the
source of that intelligence?

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Got it.

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:53.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: So essentially the--

00:41:57.270 --> 00:42:00.633 align:middle line:84%
it's not necessarily
that we are all--

00:42:00.633 --> 00:42:03.690 align:middle line:90%


00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:05.280 align:middle line:84%
I want to explain
this in the best way

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.020 align:middle line:84%
so people really,
really understand.

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:10.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily that we are
all just one being all divided

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:11.820 align:middle line:90%
into multiple different souls.

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:12.887 align:middle line:90%
We're individual.

00:42:12.887 --> 00:42:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: We're
completely individual.

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:17.440 align:middle line:84%
We always maintain
our individuality.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.140 align:middle line:90%
You never lose that.

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:22.290 align:middle line:84%
So when individuals
think that you

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:25.090 align:middle line:84%
lose your self of
individuality, that part

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:27.090 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual warfare,
it couldn't be further

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:27.700 align:middle line:90%
from the truth.

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:28.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: You see.

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:34.870 align:middle line:84%
So more of what people call
God is us individual souls.

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:36.040 align:middle line:90%
We are all God.

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:40.560 align:middle line:84%
But when people talk about the
access to all things, the field,

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.900 align:middle line:84%
it's because there
an, you could say,

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:46.860 align:middle line:84%
a frequency of
energy that exists

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:51.350 align:middle line:84%
that's sort of is an
information hub, like the ether,

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:52.150 align:middle line:90%
like the internet.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:53.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: So yeah.

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, we only have
a couple of minutes left,

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:58.600 align:middle line:84%
and we've hopped on
to quite a few things.

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:02.530 align:middle line:84%
What do you feel is, before we
part, the most important thing

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:05.410 align:middle line:84%
for people to take away
to be able to start

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:10.250 align:middle line:84%
uplifting their own reality
and that of those around them?

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: To step out of fear.

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Like to fully and
honestly, to step out of

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:19.950 align:middle line:84%
fear and step into love,
the true essence of love.

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Because the-- when you fully
transition, individuals fully

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:31.290 align:middle line:84%
transition, or through the
controlled out-of-body state,

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:33.360 align:middle line:84%
everybody's going to
see and face themselves,

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:38.375 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
see everything again.

00:43:38.375 --> 00:43:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's not necessarily
that they're being judged,

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:43.210 align:middle line:84%
because no one judges
you on the other side.

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:45.345 align:middle line:84%
You are the ultimate
judger of yourself.

00:43:45.345 --> 00:43:47.970 align:middle line:84%
The unforgivable sin is the sin
that you can't forgive yourself

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:48.770 align:middle line:90%
for.

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:52.960 align:middle line:84%
So we are the
judgers of our self.

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And so, when you do certain
things here out of accordance

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.630 align:middle line:84%
of love, that is
the pain that you

00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:04.920 align:middle line:84%
will carry on the other
side, temporarily anyways.

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.020 align:middle line:90%
But there is--

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:08.190 align:middle line:90%
That perfect.

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And you just said something
about forgiveness.

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:12.220 align:middle line:90%
And this is something I've--

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:14.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't really like
the word forgiveness.

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:18.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't really believe in
forgiveness, but I do--

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:21.050 align:middle line:84%
because I believe that if
you can simply open yourself

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:24.960 align:middle line:84%
to understanding another person,
the understanding alone is--

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:25.920 align:middle line:90%
that is forgiveness.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:28.530 align:middle line:84%
It overwrites
anything to forgive.

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And right now, so many things
are happening in the world

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:36.740 align:middle line:84%
that many people, even myself,
can no longer understand.

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:39.060 align:middle line:84%
So the forgiveness
thing is a moot point.

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:43.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand why
certain things are happening

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:47.450 align:middle line:90%
in such an ugly fashion.

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:48.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:52.620 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is where--

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:53.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:56.700 align:middle line:90%
Each individual soul needs to--

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:59.127 align:middle line:84%
an individual person,
you can't necessarily

00:44:59.127 --> 00:45:00.960 align:middle line:84%
judge them for where
they're at because they

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:06.150 align:middle line:84%
are each individual souls acting
in their fullest expression

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:08.220 align:middle line:90%
here right now in forgetfulness.

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:13.490 align:middle line:84%
So who am I to judge,
or who is anybody

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:17.850 align:middle line:84%
to judge somebody else
for where they're at?

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Because eventually,
eventually, every single soul

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:23.520 align:middle line:84%
is destined to become the
greatest version of themselves.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And that is waking up,
accessing all things again.

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And that, no matter
what the path is,

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:29.900 align:middle line:90%
should be honored and respected.

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in lieu of
the notion of forgiveness

00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:35.660 align:middle line:84%
or understanding, we
can just put acceptance

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:38.370 align:middle line:90%
with loving acceptance.

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:39.170 align:middle line:10%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:39.570 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:40.410 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That'll
take care of it.

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:41.210 align:middle line:10%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:45.830 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's not--

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:48.450 align:middle line:10%
I want to say this because
I know we're almost off.

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:50.810 align:middle line:10%
It's not necessarily
just standing

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:52.640 align:middle line:10%
when we're talking
about this, or I'm

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.040 align:middle line:10%
talking about this not
necessarily staying

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.750 align:middle line:10%
in a passive state.

00:45:56.750 --> 00:46:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Because you could proactively,
through the frequency

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and through the
energy of love, pierce

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:07.620 align:middle line:84%
through an individual in
that sense of awakening them

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:08.420 align:middle line:90%
to all things.

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Very, very good that
you've added this.

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: And when you pierce
through that, and you shake them

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.580 align:middle line:84%
and you awaken
them, then they are

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:20.870 align:middle line:84%
standing in their full
armor of fully being awake

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:23.600 align:middle line:90%
and aware of all things again.

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:25.502 align:middle line:90%
It truly empowers all.

00:46:25.502 --> 00:46:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Beautiful, and
nothing more to say on that,

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:29.060 align:middle line:90%
except thank you so much.

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:32.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad you flew in
from Australia to do this.

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.960 align:middle line:84%
You haven't been back in
the States for a long time.

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:35.990 align:middle line:90%
How does it feel?

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:39.830 align:middle line:84%
It's very different than
when you were here before.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:41.320 align:middle line:90%
I mean.

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've
been down under.

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:44.650 align:middle line:84%
This is a whole different
reality now in the US.

00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.820 align:middle line:90%
I still like Australia.

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: There is
a certain template

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:51.770 align:middle line:90%
within this certain frequency.

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DARIUS: A grid
within this realm.

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:54.400 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, wonderful.

00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, Darius, I hope
to see you again.

00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:57.520 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Yeah.

00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:57.920 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you so much.

00:46:58.970 --> 00:46:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DARIUS: Thank you.

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:01.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I hope you
enjoyed this conversation

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.240 align:middle line:90%
as much as I have.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:05.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it really goes to the
core of pretty much everything.

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:07.900 align:middle line:84%
