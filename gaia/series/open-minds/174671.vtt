00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.380 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:18.230 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.790 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Our resident
angel lady, Belinda Womack,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.440 align:middle line:10%
is back with us once again.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.260 align:middle line:10%
Her angels and Ascended
Masters know this gig with me

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:10%
pretty well, so they decided to
suggest we speak about a couple

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.484 align:middle line:10%
of things that they believe
could be helpful for us all.

00:00:31.484 --> 00:00:33.150 align:middle line:10%
So normally, it's a
little free for all.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.130 align:middle line:10%
I just kind of get in
my head and think, oh,

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.421 align:middle line:10%
I want to know about this,
and want to know about that.

00:00:37.421 --> 00:00:40.736 align:middle line:84%
But this time, they actually
told you, knocked on you

00:00:40.736 --> 00:00:43.110 align:middle line:84%
and said, could you please
write this down and send these

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.980 align:middle line:90%
to Regina?

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.422 align:middle line:84%
So it must be we need these
messages right now, right?

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:10%
>> BELINDA WOMACK: The
best thing to do is just

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:10%
to surrender, because
they usually know what--

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.710 align:middle line:10%
they know what we need.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They do.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.801 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, if I try
to ask them something else,

00:00:56.801 --> 00:00:59.306 align:middle line:84%
they're just going to tell
me these things anyway.

00:00:59.306 --> 00:01:00.180 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Likely so.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Likely.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.660 align:middle line:84%
So Belinda, a lot of people
are experiencing a very intense

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.400 align:middle line:90%
energy right now.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.010 align:middle line:84%
All around them, in their
lives, in their interactions,

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.460 align:middle line:84%
in their workplace, we're being
bathed in a sea of something

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.080 align:middle line:90%
rather intense.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm wondering is,
with all of your readings,

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.810 align:middle line:84%
consultation sessions,
channelings, and so forth,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.350 align:middle line:84%
if you're starting to see some
kind of overarching themes

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.160 align:middle line:84%
that are rising up among the
collective consciousness?

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And just kind of tell us
a little bit about that,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.190 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit about what's
being said on those themes.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: So Regina, I would
say that a common theme is that

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.750 align:middle line:84%
human beings want to
know their purpose.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.670 align:middle line:90%
What's it all about?

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.550 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.040 align:middle line:90%
Why am "I" here, right?

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Not why are we here,
but why am I here?

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.490 align:middle line:90%
So that's definitely one thing.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And they really want
insight on how to serve.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.240 align:middle line:90%
And by service, I mean to share.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.250 align:middle line:84%
To share their own gifts
that they came in with.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Another theme that
is pretty consistent

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.900 align:middle line:84%
is, how do I feel better
in my own human skin?

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.870 align:middle line:84%
How do I not have
this crazy anxiety?

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.250 align:middle line:84%
How do I feel
secure and confident

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.510 align:middle line:84%
so that I can do what
I came here to do?

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.041 align:middle line:84%
And then I would say,
hey, things are changing.

00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:33.540 align:middle line:84%
They're changing
all over the world.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.010 align:middle line:90%
I feel it.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm starting to feel
happy and hopeful,

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.520 align:middle line:90%
and I've never felt that before.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.360 align:middle line:90%
What's that about?

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Because we go back even a year
ago, most of what I heard was,

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.750 align:middle line:90%
wow, I feel so afraid.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.910 align:middle line:90%
Everything feels so heavy.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.350 align:middle line:90%
It feels so dark.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.190 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.590 align:middle line:90%
Is the world coming to an end?

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.310 align:middle line:84%
So if we just look at that,
in less than a year, at least

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.580 align:middle line:84%
the people that I'm blessed
to help and work with,

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.570 align:middle line:84%
what an amazing shift
in that feeling.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So I totally hear you
that it's intense.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.360 align:middle line:90%
It's really intense.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And what they say--
what the 12 Archangels.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Let me just introduce
them quickly.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.780 align:middle line:90%
They're beautiful colors.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.250 align:middle line:90%
What they say is surrender.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.160 align:middle line:90%
Don't fight it.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.990 align:middle line:90%
Go with the flow.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.750 align:middle line:84%
If you need something, if you
need something like confidence,

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:84%
ask Source to fill
you up with it.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.410 align:middle line:84%
If you need love for yourself,
or tolerance and compassion

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.710 align:middle line:84%
for someone else, ask
to be filled with it.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.480 align:middle line:84%
So they're really--
the 12 big guns,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.920 align:middle line:84%
like I call them, they're really
pushing us, plug into Source.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Plug into the energy
that where you come from,

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.590 align:middle line:90%
and that what sustains you.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.000 align:middle line:90%
And what you're made out of.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's good advice,
and it's excellent advice.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
about a system--

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:84%
we're looking around, and
it seems that all systems

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.420 align:middle line:90%
are breaking down.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.260 align:middle line:84%
External systems--
institutions and so forth--

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.910 align:middle line:84%
are going through a
process of breaking down.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And really, I
think the flip side

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.580 align:middle line:84%
of that is this
incredible liberation.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.060 align:middle line:84%
When you have the
system working,

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.831 align:middle line:90%
you would do the normal things.

00:04:30.831 --> 00:04:32.705 align:middle line:84%
Your parents would
program you by sending you

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:34.970 align:middle line:84%
to certain schools so you'd be
prepared for certain colleges,

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.720 align:middle line:84%
so you'd be prepared
for a certain career.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.379 align:middle line:84%
And then when you got out, boom,
take your gap year or whatever,

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:41.420 align:middle line:90%
take a couple months off.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.552 align:middle line:84%
And you plug in,
and there you are.

00:04:43.552 --> 00:04:44.760 align:middle line:90%
There's your life experience.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.250 align:middle line:90%
Your job's waiting for you.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.180 align:middle line:84%
In a world where no jobs are
really waiting for you, per se,

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.097 align:middle line:84%
the freedom is that
there's never a better time

00:04:53.097 --> 00:04:55.430 align:middle line:84%
to do what you want to do,
because the other thing isn't

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.500 align:middle line:90%
there for you anyway.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And that gets back to your
first point, which is, well,

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.550 align:middle line:90%
what am I supposed to do?

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.720 align:middle line:90%
What am I here to do?

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And tell us, when people
ask this question, what

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.160 align:middle line:84%
the angels have to say about
how a person can clearly

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.154 align:middle line:84%
knowingly identify what
it is they are here to do?

00:05:18.154 --> 00:05:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Oh, Regina.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.010 align:middle line:84%
That answer is so simple,
what the angels say.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.590 align:middle line:90%
Because they always know.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.530 align:middle line:84%
I have to just be
honest, they always know.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:84%
So the way that I help
them is with a little bit

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.870 align:middle line:84%
of sidereal astrology,
which is just

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.850 align:middle line:90%
the more ancient astrology.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.590 align:middle line:84%
It's usually right there
in our natal blueprint.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.230 align:middle line:90%
And so I basically--

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.810 align:middle line:84%
with the help of their guides
and angels-- connect the dots

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.109 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, have
you considered?

00:05:47.109 --> 00:05:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Because with human
beings, you always

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:49.910 align:middle line:90%
have to give them choice.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.000 align:middle line:84%
You cannot say to a
human being, oh, well,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.540 align:middle line:84%
you're here to do
blah blah blah.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.590 align:middle line:90%
Oh no.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.330 align:middle line:90%
Have you considered?

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And then they're
like, Belinda, that's

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.460 align:middle line:90%
exactly what I want to do.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.140 align:middle line:90%
So the heart knows.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And so to go with
what you were just

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.720 align:middle line:84%
speaking about before, the
freedom, the increased freedom.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.250 align:middle line:90%
Opportunities being taken away.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.360 align:middle line:84%
New opportunities being
placed in front of us.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.610 align:middle line:84%
This is a time when
the soul and the heart

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.200 align:middle line:84%
are guiding us more
than they ever have.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.800 align:middle line:84%
So of course the old
patriarchal systems

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.920 align:middle line:84%
are just crumbling
left and right.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.470 align:middle line:90%
And so are our physical bodies.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.330 align:middle line:84%
We have to seek healers that
can actually help us these days.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.580 align:middle line:84%
But as far as why we are here,
and what we're called to do,

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.680 align:middle line:90%
we know.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.480 align:middle line:90%
We know.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.054 align:middle line:84%
But what human beings
love is some validation.

00:06:46.054 --> 00:06:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They love--

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: They love validation.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We human beings
all love validation.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Including you, and
including me, right?

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Absolutely, yes.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the thing is,
there becomes this conundrum

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.070 align:middle line:90%
that happens with most people.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that is what I've
always wanted to do.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.960 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know how
to make money at it.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:09.620 align:middle line:10%
It always comes down to this
intertwined or ensnared notion

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:10%
of survival with people.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And they think, but how do you
make money doing that thing

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.820 align:middle line:90%
I love to do, and I'm good at?

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to be the
cancer on the planet,

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:23.590 align:middle line:84%
is that thought, that
entrapment, and that feeling.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And we could go on and on
about conspiracy theory and all

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.480 align:middle line:84%
this other stuff as
to why it exists,

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.670 align:middle line:84%
but it's existed for
a really long time.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.360 align:middle line:84%
But we have to find our
way out of that matrix

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.834 align:middle line:84%
and still eat and have
a roof over our head.

00:07:37.834 --> 00:07:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Absolutely.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.041 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so how do they
guide people through this

00:07:41.041 --> 00:07:43.310 align:middle line:84%
process, when they
say, I want to do it,

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.550 align:middle line:84%
but I'd have to quit my
day job, which I hate.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: So the way that the
angels and guides approach this

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.120 align:middle line:84%
is in a very grounded,
practical way.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.220 align:middle line:90%
They give steps.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.560 align:middle line:90%
They give the first few steps.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:03.380 align:middle line:84%
They help bring in a cohesive
plan for that individual

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.260 align:middle line:84%
who, say, for example,
they've had a corporate job.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And now they want to
go and be a healer,

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.690 align:middle line:90%
and have their own business.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So something that
the angels told me,

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.210 align:middle line:84%
even 25 years ago or more
than that now when they first

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.400 align:middle line:84%
drafted me, they said, Belinda,
start in your living room.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.070 align:middle line:90%
So they're very practical.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Truly, they are.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:32.309 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: They're not into, go
and rent a $5,000 office space.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:35.250 align:middle line:90%
No, what can you do right here?

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Because it's really about
building confidence.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And everything is
all about vibration.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:90%
Or as you would say, frequency.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:46.170 align:middle line:84%
So when we want to
bring in clients,

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:50.100 align:middle line:84%
or we want to bring in new
opportunities in a new way,

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.260 align:middle line:84%
we have to change
that within ourselves.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:57.720 align:middle line:84%
We have to fill up with
love, and hope, and faith

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.180 align:middle line:84%
so that we can bring
in what we need.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.520 align:middle line:90%
And we will.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And then they say, you're
not doing this alone.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Human being, you're
not doing this alone.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.420 align:middle line:84%
You think you're
a sole proprietor?

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, let us set you straight.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:19.140 align:middle line:84%
You have this huge committee
of guides, helpers, icons.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.620 align:middle line:90%
We're helping you.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And--

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.084 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: It takes patience
to line everything up.

00:09:24.084 --> 00:09:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.460 align:middle line:84%
But time is the issue
that often comes

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.310 align:middle line:90%
into play in this dimension.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.830 align:middle line:84%
But I can't wait two years
for that to happen, right?

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.022 align:middle line:90%
But we can.

00:09:34.022 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: We can, and then--

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we can make
things happen in the interim.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: Absolutely, and
the angels are very clear.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.490 align:middle line:84%
If you need to
keep your day job--

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:46.190 align:middle line:90%
they give you steps.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.180 align:middle line:84%
They say, OK, well, you're
going to give up that,

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.400 align:middle line:84%
but you're going to become
a contractor for this,

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.110 align:middle line:84%
and this is the way
it's going to look

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.039 align:middle line:90%
until you get this set up so.

00:09:55.039 --> 00:09:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I hear
what you're saying.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And the pain that is caused
around the subject of money

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:06.370 align:middle line:84%
in general, for most
people, and the squashing

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.910 align:middle line:84%
it does to our hearts
and our creativity,

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:13.660 align:middle line:84%
is just to me-- that is the
travesty and the challenge

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:14.800 align:middle line:90%
of Earth life.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.570 align:middle line:90%
But it can be transformed.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.030 align:middle line:84%
As you say, things
move seemingly.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Here, we are this
brilliant being

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.470 align:middle line:84%
that can create at the
speed of light, and thought,

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:25.270 align:middle line:90%
and dream time.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And you come back
into the body, and it

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.540 align:middle line:84%
can take a year or two to slog
through, and create a plan

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.880 align:middle line:84%
and get it done, this
whole notion of time.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: It does take
patience and perseverance.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.450 align:middle line:84%
But according to
the angels, that's

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.460 align:middle line:90%
serving a higher purpose.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:46.000 align:middle line:84%
So Saturn is the same
as Archangel Michael.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And Saturn, when Saturn is
moving through our natal chart,

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.600 align:middle line:84%
it's teaching us what
we no longer need.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.820 align:middle line:84%
What is it, human being,
that you no longer need,

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.200 align:middle line:90%
you no longer want?

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So this patience, this
time, why things take time,

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.420 align:middle line:84%
it's actually working deep,
deep down within ourselves so

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.760 align:middle line:90%
that we can receive.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Human beings have a big
issue with receiving.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
money can come in too.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Either we have this kind
of grandiose illusion

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.530 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
receive buckets of gold

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:24.190 align:middle line:84%
from the leprechauns in
heaven, or that money

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:25.540 align:middle line:90%
is hard to come by.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And neither one of those are
truth, according to the angels.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.580 align:middle line:84%
What they say, you're here
to exchange the energy

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.440 align:middle line:90%
and giftedness of your soul.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.930 align:middle line:84%
We can't just drop
it in your lap,

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.360 align:middle line:84%
especially if
you're an old soul.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.460 align:middle line:84%
If you're an ancient
one, and you're creative,

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and you're here to help
raise the vibration,

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.510 align:middle line:84%
the angels say, we need you
to engage with humanity.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.020 align:middle line:84%
We need you to get
your hands dirty.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.210 align:middle line:90%
Roll up your sleeves.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:55.290 align:middle line:90%
Be engaged.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.150 align:middle line:84%
So no, we can't just
deposit a huge sum of money

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:02.750 align:middle line:84%
in your bank account, because
then you will go to your cave,

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.780 align:middle line:90%
and we can't have you do that.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.610 align:middle line:90%
So let's have both.

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at what
you can receive in.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.910 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, let's look
at what you need to be sharing

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:21.011 align:middle line:84%
that lifts you up when you
do it, and lifts humanity up,

00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:23.385 align:middle line:84%
and Schoolroom Earth-- that's
what the angels call planet

00:12:23.385 --> 00:12:24.350 align:middle line:90%
Earth--

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:28.607 align:middle line:84%
lifts this planet
up at the same time.

00:12:28.607 --> 00:12:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Totally agreed.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And also, it gives a time
of training for a person.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.330 align:middle line:84%
As this time goes on, and you
take your baby steps forward

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.699 align:middle line:84%
into your new
endeavor, you have time

00:12:40.699 --> 00:12:42.740 align:middle line:84%
to practice it while you
haven't had to quite let

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.840 align:middle line:90%
go of the security of the old.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And you start growing new
confidence in yourself.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.260 align:middle line:90%
It's really a very practical--

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.230 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a practical
reason for the passage of time

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:55.620 align:middle line:90%
in that sense.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.310 align:middle line:84%
You have to grow your
confidence, grow your wings,

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.200 align:middle line:90%
grow your aptitudes.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Do a little trial and
error during that time

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.242 align:middle line:84%
when you're trying
to grow the new

00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:05.450 align:middle line:90%
before you let go of the old.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.372 align:middle line:84%
But then of course, we
have other choices too.

00:13:07.372 --> 00:13:09.080 align:middle line:84%
We can choose to live
in a different way.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.340 align:middle line:90%
Different kind of lifestyle.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.310 align:middle line:90%
Downsize, all of that.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.654 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: We can, but they
say that's not required.

00:13:16.654 --> 00:13:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And the angels, I
just have to tell you,

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.320 align:middle line:84%
they're blowing you kisses,
because they love the way you

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.600 align:middle line:90%
explained that with time.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And the hidden blessings
that come with this.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
grateful to you.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.400 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.370 align:middle line:84%
When I think of people
and their guide,

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:36.500 align:middle line:90%
I always see this picture.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And I see guides and people
who are not engaging with,

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.220 align:middle line:84%
not aware of-- and
even if they are,

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.600 align:middle line:84%
they're not calling on
these incredible beings.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.760 align:middle line:90%
I forget to call them myself.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And I just imagine them kind
of having a smoke break.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And you put your stub out when
it looks like something might

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.210 align:middle line:84%
be peeking, like, I think
they're going to ask,

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.395 align:middle line:90%
I think they're going to--

00:14:00.395 --> 00:14:01.310 align:middle line:90%
ugh, missed it.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.390 align:middle line:90%
Light up another one.

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Just killing time,
waiting for us to engage.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Yet at the same
time, I find it so--

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.810 align:middle line:84%
as long as we're not married
to time, that what they do

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:17.210 align:middle line:90%
is so incredibly profound.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.280 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter how
small or how large,

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:24.200 align:middle line:84%
the ingenious ways in
which my guides put things

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.220 align:middle line:84%
in front of me, and
help me along my path.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking, you got me.

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.840 align:middle line:84%
I would've never
figured that one out.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.790 align:middle line:84%
I would have never
gone that way.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:33.890 align:middle line:84%
They have a genius,
because they see

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:36.140 align:middle line:84%
beyond all of the limitations
of our programming.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.540 align:middle line:90%
We don't.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Well, totally.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And their job is to get
the message through.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.660 align:middle line:90%
And they don't give up.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: At least with the
12 Archangels who work with all

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.280 align:middle line:84%
of us, whether we are
aware of it or not.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.629 align:middle line:90%
They are relentless.

00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Sometimes like
a jackhammer on the top

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.940 align:middle line:90%
of the head.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: Well, they say a
violet fire cast iron skillet,

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.370 align:middle line:90%
but.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: To get bopped by one.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have some
wonderful questions

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:04.520 align:middle line:84%
that they have put forward for
me to put forward to them, OK?

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.130 align:middle line:84%
So let's go ahead and let
you take a breath or two

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:08.630 align:middle line:84%
and connected, and
then we'll begin.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.630 align:middle line:90%


00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: They say we are here.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Welcome, and thank
you for joining us again here

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.360 align:middle line:84%
in the studios, and
actually at all times.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you for
buzzing through to Belinda

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.812 align:middle line:84%
to prompt a few
questions that I probably

00:15:28.812 --> 00:15:30.020 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't have thought to ask.

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And one of them starts out with
a theme that's very simple,

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.070 align:middle line:84%
which is the notion of
finding peace in these times.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.570 align:middle line:84%
It feels so frenetic
and chaotic.

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the question is, how
does an individual living

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:48.210 align:middle line:84%
amidst all of this, in the
most efficient way possible,

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:52.520 align:middle line:84%
find a state of peace in
their mind, in their hearts,

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.056 align:middle line:90%
and in their bodies?

00:15:55.056 --> 00:15:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Hm.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:03.680 align:middle line:84%
We, the 12 Archangels, say
this is a simple question.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.615 align:middle line:84%
But the answer for you human
beings can be so very complex.

00:16:07.615 --> 00:16:11.430 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.270 align:middle line:90%
The essence is gratitude.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:18.740 align:middle line:84%
When you get up in the
morning, if you can be grateful

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:23.900 align:middle line:84%
that you woke up, if you can be
grateful for your hot shower,

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.080 align:middle line:84%
if you can be grateful
for your breakfast,

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.630 align:middle line:90%
this lifts your vibration.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And as that happens, we,
your angels, and guides,

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and loved ones, the Creator
where you all come from,

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.670 align:middle line:90%
can fill you with joy.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:middle line:84%
There's a little child
that lives within you,

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.250 align:middle line:84%
and we see you
always as children.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And when that child
feels safe, which

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.260 align:middle line:84%
is what practicing
gratitude will

00:16:54.260 --> 00:17:01.850 align:middle line:84%
do in the most simplest of
ways, you light up, you lift up,

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:05.339 align:middle line:90%
and you calm down.

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:12.519 align:middle line:84%
We also recommend to you
beautiful human beings, laugh!

00:17:12.519 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:90%
Laugh!

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:15.869 align:middle line:10%
There's so much to laugh about!

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:18.839 align:middle line:84%
Even if you want
to laugh about how

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:25.170 align:middle line:84%
crazy and ridiculous the global
movie of Schoolroom Earth

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:31.840 align:middle line:84%
is at this time, laugh
at the ridiculousness.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And then last, but not least,
you will see 12 Archangels.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:42.250 align:middle line:90%
That is truly simple.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:51.690 align:middle line:84%
But we remind you, human
beings, breathe deeply.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Breathe as if it is your
last breath before diving

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:57.560 align:middle line:90%
into deep water.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.290 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Breathe, and you
will experience calm.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:09.300 align:middle line:90%
It really is that simple.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.800 align:middle line:84%
When you take a
deep breath, fear

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.450 align:middle line:84%
has no room within
your beautiful mind.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.550 align:middle line:84%
There's no room for
it because you are

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.920 align:middle line:90%
filled with the holy breath.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And we encourage
you, beautiful ones,

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:33.485 align:middle line:90%
laugh, breathe, and be thankful.

00:18:33.485 --> 00:18:36.210 align:middle line:90%


00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:38.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Thank you
for that reminder.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.640 align:middle line:90%
It's so true.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's also-- as a human
that loves validation

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.950 align:middle line:84%
like everybody else, I
wrote a blog on the subject

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:50.250 align:middle line:84%
of gratitude
recently, in that it

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:54.540 align:middle line:84%
shifts the frequencies or
the vibrations of the body

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:55.470 align:middle line:90%
so radically.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:57.330 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
practical little piece

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:02.850 align:middle line:84%
I wrote on gratitude, that it
is actually the closest thing

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:06.210 align:middle line:90%
akin to what we call love here.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And by going into this lovely
little place of gratitude

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.130 align:middle line:90%
in the mornings, it does.

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:14.550 align:middle line:84%
It has this rapid shift
in our vibrations.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to thank you
for reminding us all of that.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.310 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't agree more, and
certainly with the breath

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:21.190 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:22.840 align:middle line:90%
So that was wonderful.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.570 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
different subjects

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.806 align:middle line:84%
that you talked to Linda
about at one point.

00:19:27.806 --> 00:19:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And so it'll seem a little
bit like we're hopping around.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.880 align:middle line:84%
So I want to ask you, do
you have anything further

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:38.160 align:middle line:84%
to say on the subject of peace
before we switch subjects?

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: One more little item.

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.620 align:middle line:90%


00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.260 align:middle line:84%
As you allow peace
to live within you,

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.950 align:middle line:84%
because you are
all one, you truly

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:54.150 align:middle line:84%
do help to manifest
peace on Earth.

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.460 align:middle line:84%
You help to bring peace
where peace has been

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.560 align:middle line:90%
missing for a very long time.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.850 align:middle line:90%
So we thank you.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:07.242 align:middle line:84%
We thank you, individual,
beautiful, divine children

00:20:07.242 --> 00:20:11.760 align:middle line:90%
for practicing peacefulness.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And hear us, that
you, each of you

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:24.130 align:middle line:84%
are helping to bring peace
to Schoolroom Earth in ways

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:26.450 align:middle line:90%
unimaginable.

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Because where you bring
peace, we multiply that peace.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:37.640 align:middle line:84%
We are all working
together, beautiful beings

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.210 align:middle line:90%
of light and sound.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that is also
an ancient Hermetic basis

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.030 align:middle line:84%
for practice of all things
and for all knowledge.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Without a peaceful
mind, you really

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.670 align:middle line:84%
can't integrate new
knowledge very well.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:58.830 align:middle line:84%
You can't integrate
anything very well.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:03.720 align:middle line:84%
We can't integrate change
without having a peaceful, calm

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.770 align:middle line:90%
campus to start from.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And one of the Hermetics'
most powerful words,

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:11.850 align:middle line:84%
and beginning words, and
ending words, is peace.

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:13.540 align:middle line:90%
Finding that within.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:17.040 align:middle line:84%
So I appreciate that you're
underscoring how important it

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.700 align:middle line:84%
is that if we focus
even on this one thing,

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:84%
we start bringing the
planet into a higher

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.770 align:middle line:90%
vibrational range.

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.080 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:90%
And the next one is on parents.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:36.210 align:middle line:84%
On, before we incarnate into a
given Earth life, how and why

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:40.070 align:middle line:90%
we choose the parents we do.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: This is very
important for human beings

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.080 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:52.110 align:middle line:84%
Because again, each of you,
we see you as a divine child.

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Your true parents are your
Higher Self, your Divine

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Feminine, and your
Divine Masculine.

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:02.130 align:middle line:90%
You choose your Earthly parents.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:05.730 align:middle line:84%
That egg and sperm that
is going to bring you

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.500 align:middle line:90%
into this physicality.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.120 align:middle line:84%
You choose them
very, very carefully.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.700 align:middle line:10%
You choose them
based on your karma.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:16.590 align:middle line:10%
That just means your homework.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:20.070 align:middle line:10%
Did you have a past
life with this soul

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:25.200 align:middle line:10%
that you need to bring
more unconditional love

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.140 align:middle line:10%
and acceptance into
this relationship?

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps you need
the genetic information

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:37.500 align:middle line:84%
that comes from this ancestral
lineage of the mother

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.070 align:middle line:90%
or of the father.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:46.100 align:middle line:10%
We say that the parents
that you have chosen

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:51.650 align:middle line:10%
are God's gift to you, even if
they are really challenging.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:56.880 align:middle line:10%
And parents, we say
to you, the souls

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:01.300 align:middle line:10%
that you bring in that
become your children,

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:03.430 align:middle line:10%
this is your great blessing.

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:07.080 align:middle line:10%
Because they are
teaching you something

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:11.670 align:middle line:10%
that truly no other
soul can teach you.

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Our message to all of
you is to find gratitude.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:21.000 align:middle line:84%
To find gratitude and
unconditional acceptance

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.010 align:middle line:84%
for the parents,
for the children,

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:28.260 align:middle line:84%
for the family members that
you have been blessed with.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:36.550 align:middle line:84%
For you are healing on a DNA,
on a genome-by-genome level.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is why you
choose your parents,

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:44.570 align:middle line:84%
and you choose your
children so carefully.

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:48.800 align:middle line:84%
From our perspective, a great
deal of humanity's heartache

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:55.710 align:middle line:84%
comes because that child within
becomes hurt and wounded.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:24:03.340 align:middle line:84%
The parents were unable to give
that child, who's now 30, 40,

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:07.080 align:middle line:90%
70, what that child needed.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.920 align:middle line:84%
This was all agreed
to, human beings.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:15.270 align:middle line:84%
It was all accepted before
you came into this life.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Because this is a schoolroom.

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.630 align:middle line:84%
You chose the
parents who could not

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:25.200 align:middle line:84%
love so that you
would learn, you

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.760 align:middle line:84%
would remember to
plug into Source,

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.870 align:middle line:84%
to stay within the
heart of the Creator.

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:36.750 align:middle line:10%
And to find a
strength and courage

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:44.100 align:middle line:10%
that you could not find if you
had parents that were perfect.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.100 align:middle line:84%
There is a reason
for everything.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.720 align:middle line:90%
You have not been victimized.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So feel your feelings
lift up the hurts,

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:57.720 align:middle line:84%
whether you are the child,
or you are the parent.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Lift up the hurt, and put
it in the color purple.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.660 align:middle line:84%
That violet fire that
lives within your crown

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:10.800 align:middle line:84%
chakra, the battery
on top of your head

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:18.240 align:middle line:84%
given to you to transform
that which is less than love,

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.090 align:middle line:84%
and to fill you
with forgiveness.

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:25.670 align:middle line:10%
Forgiveness is as
powerful as gratitude.

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:32.510 align:middle line:10%
If you want to change your life
miraculously [CLAPS] like that,

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:37.960 align:middle line:10%
fill up with forgiveness
for those whom you have not

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:42.020 align:middle line:10%
been able to understand.

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And take the responsibility
fully that you chose them.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:53.180 align:middle line:84%
My understanding
has been that we--

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.510 align:middle line:84%
not every time, but
generally do follow

00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:00.890 align:middle line:84%
that DNA pool that we have
been with so we can have

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:05.900 align:middle line:84%
a smooth continuance of
experience, or balancing,

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:10.630 align:middle line:90%
or as you say, homework.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:15.564 align:middle line:84%
And so that usually, oftentimes,
this gene pool we've been in

00:26:15.564 --> 00:26:17.980 align:middle line:84%
is not always the first time
we've been in this gene pool.

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:22.610 align:middle line:84%
We may have continued throughout
if for even generations,

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:25.900 align:middle line:90%
sometimes, for this continuance.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: Or
sometimes not, Regina.

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
sometimes not, yes.

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
the sometimes not.

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what happens
when you have parents,

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:41.080 align:middle line:84%
and the parents are
people who are welcoming

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.260 align:middle line:84%
a child in the world, either
whether it was planned or not

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:48.790 align:middle line:84%
planned, but that there
are certain challenges that

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.460 align:middle line:90%
present themselves.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Do you often have one, two,
or three different entities

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:01.900 align:middle line:84%
that are waiting and watching
to see which one might best

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.690 align:middle line:84%
go back into, or into
for the first time,

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:07.780 align:middle line:84%
that particular
situation or bloodline?

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Or is there only one
match for a given body,

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.040 align:middle line:84%
and if it doesn't
work, the baby dies?

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:19.150 align:middle line:10%
>> WOMACK: You are very
particular about the family,

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:23.510 align:middle line:10%
the set of genetics, again,
the egg and the sperm that you

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:28.800 align:middle line:10%
choose to incarnate into.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:34.450 align:middle line:84%
The ancient souls that have
returned to Schoolroom Earth

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:39.000 align:middle line:84%
to help hold this vibration,
and to really bring

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.250 align:middle line:84%
in love and higher
consciousness,

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:46.500 align:middle line:90%
you are extremely particular.

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:51.810 align:middle line:10%
You plan your reentry for
usually about seven generations

00:27:51.810 --> 00:27:54.510 align:middle line:10%
prior to when you enter.

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:58.530 align:middle line:10%
Those generations are
also carefully planned.

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:01.620 align:middle line:84%
This is not only for
genetic purposes.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:04.880 align:middle line:84%
This is also so that
the subconscious,

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:12.370 align:middle line:84%
the emotional baggage is
set up for you to transform.

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:18.880 align:middle line:84%
So that as you transform your
seven generations of ancestry,

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.310 align:middle line:90%
you do this for all of humanity.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Do the math, and
you can understand.

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:26.770 align:middle line:84%
You can hear us
that eventually you

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:32.070 align:middle line:84%
have every human being that has
ever walked this Earth covered.

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:37.660 align:middle line:84%
For some, it is wow,
Schoolroom Earth

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.840 align:middle line:90%
is so exciting at this time.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.940 align:middle line:90%
I want to come and help.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:46.130 align:middle line:84%
These are like the
firemen and women.

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:48.932 align:middle line:84%
These are like the policemen
and women, the service

00:28:48.932 --> 00:28:52.400 align:middle line:90%
people on your planet Earth.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, they are also existing
within the universe,

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:57.770 align:middle line:90%
and they hear the plea.

00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:00.260 align:middle line:84%
They hear the plea
of Schoolroom Earth.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And they say, I have
to get in there now.

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:08.460 align:middle line:90%
I will deal with it.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:11.720 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes, they cannot.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.740 align:middle line:10%
We, the 12 Archangels together
with the Ascended Masters

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.760 align:middle line:10%
of the White Light and
Sound of the Central Sun,

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.870 align:middle line:10%
we always advise, use
caution before you

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:26.510 align:middle line:10%
come into Schoolroom Earth.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Just like you would pick
your universities with care.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:37.410 align:middle line:84%
You would make sure that you are
accepted, that you are ready,

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and you have the
grade, so to speak.

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:50.320 align:middle line:10%
Now, when you rush
in, it can feel

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:56.030 align:middle line:10%
like icy, icy water being
thrown all over you.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:58.400 align:middle line:84%
But we are there to
help, as are many,

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.360 align:middle line:90%
many, many guardian angels.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And we recommend
to any of you who

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:08.740 align:middle line:84%
are listening that feel
like, maybe that's me,

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:13.060 align:middle line:84%
maybe I just came in
too quickly, because all

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:17.540 align:middle line:84%
I seem to think about is,
how do I get out of here?

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:21.170 align:middle line:84%
We recommend-- and please
do not laugh at us,

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:24.560 align:middle line:90%
we are quite serious--

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:29.060 align:middle line:84%
find the perfect
canine angel for you.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:32.180 align:middle line:10%
Find a dog who
will sit with you,

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:36.750 align:middle line:10%
and ground you, and give
the child within you

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.750 align:middle line:10%
a reason to be here.

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Because your heart came
here with good purpose.

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.575 align:middle line:90%


00:30:45.575 --> 00:30:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:49.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
confusion around this.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:51.400 align:middle line:10%
And there's the one other--
if you don't mind answering,

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.510 align:middle line:10%
because our audience
finds this interesting--

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:58.990 align:middle line:10%
the unique situation
in which a soul

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:01.420 align:middle line:10%
comes into the body
for x number of years,

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.840 align:middle line:10%
and then realizes it's
too icy, I can't do this,

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.700 align:middle line:10%
and another soul is waiting.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.600 align:middle line:10%
And they basically
make a change.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:15.970 align:middle line:90%
And they call this walking in.

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:17.830 align:middle line:84%
One soul leaves, and
another walks in.

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:21.460 align:middle line:84%
What is your take
on this phenomena?

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: From our perspective,
the only way that this

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:31.600 align:middle line:84%
occurrence called walking in
happens is when a different

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:38.440 align:middle line:84%
octave of the same soul
fabric replaces one of a lower

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.110 align:middle line:90%
vibration.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:44.410 align:middle line:84%
You can never go
down in vibration.

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And some human beings believe
that, somehow, they walked out

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.920 align:middle line:90%
and someone new walked in.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:32:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And we say, the Schoolroom,
the foundation was not

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.160 align:middle line:90%
established in that way.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.650 align:middle line:84%
You can take your
energy, and you

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:10.510 align:middle line:90%
can project it into a baseball.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:12.850 align:middle line:90%
That you can do.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:16.690 align:middle line:84%
You can ride through the
skies with a beautiful hawk,

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:19.060 align:middle line:90%
or eagle.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:22.990 align:middle line:84%
But you do not flip
in and out of bodies

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:26.060 align:middle line:84%
like turning on a light
switch and turning it off.

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:28.680 align:middle line:90%


00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:34.590 align:middle line:10%
The closest to this is if
there is a very major organ

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:38.580 align:middle line:10%
transplant in your
physical body.

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Let us say that there
is a heart transplant.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, then you
really are bringing

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:47.910 align:middle line:84%
in some of the
soul essence, some

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:52.270 align:middle line:84%
of the chi of that
human being who

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:56.620 align:middle line:84%
has bequeathed their organ to
you so that they can leave.

00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:02.410 align:middle line:84%
But this was all agreed on
in the realms of heaven.

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:09.710 align:middle line:84%
So we say that it
is rare altogether.

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:11.170 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:12.169 align:middle line:90%
That's my understanding.

00:33:12.169 --> 00:33:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: Very,
very, very rare.

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.050 align:middle line:84%
There is many
levels of approval,

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:20.120 align:middle line:84%
for good reason, why
this must happen,

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:23.880 align:middle line:90%
because this is a school.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.650 align:middle line:90%
So if you believe--

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:30.010 align:middle line:84%
if any of your
listeners, your audience,

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:32.470 align:middle line:84%
believes that they
are a walk in,

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:40.980 align:middle line:84%
we want to reassure them
that, please, be grounded.

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Honor the parents that
gave birth to you.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And understand
that it could be--

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:51.240 align:middle line:84%
this is a planet
of choice, we're

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.220 align:middle line:84%
not telling you what
to believe-- but it

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:57.810 align:middle line:84%
could be that you
have gone through such

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:02.670 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful vibrational
shift that you just think,

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:06.370 align:middle line:84%
perhaps I'm a completely
different person.

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:12.239 align:middle line:84%
We leave that for you to
reflect on, beautiful beings.

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:13.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:15.150 align:middle line:10%
You have also
mentioned that there

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:18.120 align:middle line:10%
is a unique relationship
between mothers

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.300 align:middle line:10%
and sons on this planet.

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.179 align:middle line:90%
Can you elaborate on that?

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:29.449 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: Mothers and
sons, we would like to say,

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:36.840 align:middle line:84%
without exception have been
lovers in another life.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:40.500 align:middle line:90%
And there was an abandonment.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:49.165 align:middle line:10%
Usually, the son
abandoned the mother.

00:34:49.165 --> 00:34:56.770 align:middle line:10%
And this abandonment caused
the human heart to shatter

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:59.410 align:middle line:10%
in a zillion, million,
trillion pieces.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:03.300 align:middle line:90%


00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.130 align:middle line:90%
So why?

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Why would a mother say, I will
bring this lover in and allow

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:14.310 align:middle line:90%
him to break my heart again?

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:20.100 align:middle line:10%
Because this is what happens
between a mother and a son,

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.370 align:middle line:10%
oftentimes accidentally.

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:27.332 align:middle line:10%
The son worships the mother.

00:35:27.332 --> 00:35:30.097 align:middle line:84%
And then the mother
must set boundaries.

00:35:30.097 --> 00:35:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And then the mother
is the worst thing

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:35.620 align:middle line:84%
that ever happened
in the son's life.

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:40.900 align:middle line:90%
The gift here is for the mother.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:43.150 align:middle line:84%
This is an opportunity
for the mother

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:47.590 align:middle line:84%
to hear it was not her
fault. The abandonment

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:50.810 align:middle line:84%
in the other life
was not her fault.

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:54.070 align:middle line:10%
And it is time for
her to mend her heart

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:57.220 align:middle line:10%
with the help of her Higher
Self, and her angels,

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:59.290 align:middle line:10%
and guides.

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:01.990 align:middle line:90%
Because here is the beauty.

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:05.790 align:middle line:10%
And we have tears
running down our faces--

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:14.400 align:middle line:10%
yes, angels cry-- when a
mother heals her human heart

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:20.910 align:middle line:10%
by truly surrendering her son to
his own soul, his own journey,

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:26.280 align:middle line:10%
and seeing clearly
that it is not

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.530 align:middle line:10%
her fault, this abandonment.

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:34.470 align:middle line:84%
That her heart can be
healed and filled with love,

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:39.310 align:middle line:84%
an unconditional
love for this son.

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And even more
importantly, for herself.

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.810 align:middle line:90%


00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:47.812 align:middle line:84%
She heals the hearts
of all mothers.

00:36:47.812 --> 00:36:49.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's very powerful.

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And while we're on
that subject of lovers

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:57.490 align:middle line:84%
and intimate relationships,
you feel, or you say,

00:36:57.490 --> 00:37:00.815 align:middle line:84%
that this is one of
the most efficient,

00:37:00.815 --> 00:37:04.680 align:middle line:84%
the most profound ways
of our own evolution

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:09.030 align:middle line:84%
is the way in which we serve
as mirrors for one another.

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:13.310 align:middle line:10%
>> WOMACK: When two human
beings fall in love,

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:16.940 align:middle line:10%
or even when they fall in lust
because they do not know what

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:28.220 align:middle line:10%
love is yet, that partner
is reflecting back to them

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:36.890 align:middle line:10%
their beauty, their
passion, their life essence.

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:38.240 align:middle line:90%
And it works both ways.

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.020 align:middle line:90%


00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:45.550 align:middle line:10%
The pain comes in when
one of the personalities

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:49.600 align:middle line:10%
is not as evolved as the other.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.850 align:middle line:10%
The souls are in alignment.

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:57.140 align:middle line:10%
The hearts feel the love,
because hearts always will.

00:37:57.140 --> 00:38:00.050 align:middle line:84%
If you were to ask
Belinda this question,

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:05.390 align:middle line:84%
she would tell you she
falls in love with everyone.

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:08.520 align:middle line:10%
And she really does.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.160 align:middle line:84%
It does not replace her
husband, we would like to add.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:16.320 align:middle line:84%
But that falling in love,
that just loving everyone

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:19.270 align:middle line:90%
is a beautiful experience.

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:22.690 align:middle line:90%
And so we say to you, try it.

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:25.330 align:middle line:84%
But let us say that
you have fallen in love

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:28.200 align:middle line:90%
with a significant other.

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:31.140 align:middle line:90%
And it is real love this time.

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:35.470 align:middle line:84%
It works as a plunger to
bring up the wounded child.

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:37.770 align:middle line:90%
What do we mean by this?

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:41.040 align:middle line:84%
It brings up all
the unworthiness,

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.200 align:middle line:84%
all the fear of
abandonment, all the

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:45.430 align:middle line:90%
fear that you will be rejected.

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:49.370 align:middle line:84%
But this is really
your own stuff.

00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Your own shtick,
as some of you say.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:59.440 align:middle line:84%
You see, you are experts
at abandoning and rejecting

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:03.900 align:middle line:84%
yourselves, feeling not good
enough, not worthy enough.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing like true
love, real love to purge this

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.340 align:middle line:90%
up and out of you.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And we say out of you,
beautiful human being.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.540 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:18.760 align:middle line:10%
When you are in a
relationship, whether that

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:26.140 align:middle line:10%
is new, developing, or 5,000
lifetimes in the making,

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:30.550 align:middle line:10%
and you feel those old feelings
of unworthiness come up,

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:34.630 align:middle line:10%
and maybe I'm not good enough,
maybe he won't call me back,

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:38.230 align:middle line:10%
maybe he doesn't feel
the same, maybe she

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:41.970 align:middle line:10%
says all of this to her lovers.

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Release it.

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:43.890 align:middle line:90%
Give it to us.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:45.520 align:middle line:90%
We're here.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.510 align:middle line:90%
We are here.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:51.160 align:middle line:84%
We love to take your
garbage, human beings.

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:54.220 align:middle line:84%
We take it in our hands,
we put it in our hearts,

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and we transform it into love,
and then we fill you with it.

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:02.020 align:middle line:90%
It is your own energy.

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:10.390 align:middle line:84%
You see, we are the recyclers
of human emotion and thought.

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:15.970 align:middle line:84%
This is why your relationships
are so very potent.

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And we're speaking to you
of a romantic relationship.

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:26.820 align:middle line:84%
This is true if it is a
casual business colleague.

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:29.370 align:middle line:84%
If that person is
pushing your buttons,

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:34.380 align:middle line:84%
thank her or him, because
this is your opportunity

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:40.150 align:middle line:84%
to release it, let
it go, and grow.

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:43.370 align:middle line:90%
What does growth give you?

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:47.000 align:middle line:10%
It gives you freedom,
human beings.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.470 align:middle line:90%
It gives you abundance.

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:51.340 align:middle line:90%


00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:56.500 align:middle line:90%
It really, really truly does.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's a lot
of profound information.

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
words that came up

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:04.660 align:middle line:84%
that it seems like it's
an epidemic on this planet

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:10.090 align:middle line:84%
is this incredible feeling
of, or fear of abandonment.

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: It is the
number one human fear.

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:21.110 align:middle line:84%
It is the fear that controls
you from your root chakra on up.

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And it is the fear that
creates separation among you.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:34.260 align:middle line:84%
Separation in your
social economic tribes.

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:42.970 align:middle line:84%
It is what creates
wars, injustice, abuse.

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:46.270 align:middle line:84%
It all comes down to
the fear of abandonment.

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And the ultimate
abandonment, that button

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:56.070 align:middle line:84%
that is triggered when
a lover is not secure,

00:41:56.070 --> 00:42:00.640 align:middle line:84%
when that ego does not feel
like he or she is totally

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:06.390 align:middle line:84%
in control, the
button that is pushed

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:09.700 align:middle line:90%
is that God has abandoned you.

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.620 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps there is no Creator.

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps there is no Divine
Oneness, no Mother Father

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:19.450 align:middle line:90%
God, no Source.

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:22.750 align:middle line:90%


00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:27.590 align:middle line:84%
Why has God forsaken
me if my lover is not

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:32.855 align:middle line:84%
returning my text messages,
we hear often these days.

00:42:32.855 --> 00:42:36.310 align:middle line:84%
But we say this is an
opportunity for healing.

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:41.000 align:middle line:84%
For, as you lift up
that fear of abandonment

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.910 align:middle line:84%
that your Creator can abandon
you-- which is a great lie.

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:50.440 align:middle line:90%
You never leave the Creator.

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And if a lover has
stepped out of your movie,

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:57.070 align:middle line:84%
we say that in a short time,
you will agree with us--

00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:58.260 align:middle line:90%
you always do--

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.500 align:middle line:90%
that that was a great blessing.

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:01.300 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.925 align:middle line:84%
Thank goodness he
didn't stick around.

00:43:03.925 --> 00:43:06.450 align:middle line:90%


00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And we say to you, why
go into this guilt?

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Here, we don't care if
you've had 25 marriages.

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:18.870 align:middle line:84%
When you meet the
right one, that

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:22.940 align:middle line:84%
is the only marriage
that counts.

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And that is truly
what was intended

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:31.120 align:middle line:84%
in the original Judeo-Christian
Ten Commandments.

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:36.440 align:middle line:84%
We do not wish to get into
a discussion of religion.

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.820 align:middle line:90%
We make a point.

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:42.610 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate fear,
beautiful human beings,

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:45.370 align:middle line:90%
is your fear of abandonment.

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And that the Creator, Mother
Father God has rejected you.

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:53.390 align:middle line:90%
And we say this is impossible.

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Lift up your fear
of abandonment.

00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Put it in the color purple
so that it can be forgiven.

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And ask us, ask Source,
ask your own soul,

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:10.250 align:middle line:90%
to fill you with trust in you.

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Trust that it is impossible
to leave the heart of God.

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And faith, complete
and total faith,

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:25.130 align:middle line:84%
in your complete and
total lovability.

00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Because we say to you, oh, oh
my precious, precious child

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:33.950 align:middle line:90%
of God.

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:39.200 align:middle line:90%
You are so very lovable.

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And when we begin
this process and allow these

00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:47.120 align:middle line:84%
feelings to start bubbling
up that manifest from--

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.700 align:middle line:84%
they appear to be
fear of abandonment--

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:51.770 align:middle line:84%
then all the subconscious
from generations

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:52.790 align:middle line:90%
bubbles up behind it.

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And you believe that
it is good for us

00:44:55.190 --> 00:45:02.550 align:middle line:84%
to essentially investigate,
even excavate our own interior

00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:04.690 align:middle line:90%
blind spots and subconscious.

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And I ask you, how do you
feel we best accomplish this?

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Is this through third
party regression?

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Is it simply by allowing it
to bubble up and feel it,

00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and simply recognize and
be open enough to recognize

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:19.880 align:middle line:90%
what we're being shown?

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.190 align:middle line:90%
How do we do this best?

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:23.000 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Hm.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.680 align:middle line:84%
We wish to share with you
a very, very short version

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:32.730 align:middle line:84%
of our most recent tool
that we have given Belinda

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:34.110 align:middle line:90%
that we love.

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:38.330 align:middle line:84%
We get so excited
about this, Regina.

00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:41.650 align:middle line:90%
And we call it a DNA Scrub.

00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:44.470 align:middle line:90%
You just close your eyes.

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:45.490 align:middle line:90%
You breathe.

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:47.620 align:middle line:90%
You find the child within you.

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:51.490 align:middle line:84%
You visualize a beautiful
violet fire ocean.

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:56.710 align:middle line:84%
This is the energy of
transformation and forgiveness.

00:45:56.710 --> 00:46:01.090 align:middle line:84%
The ocean is filled
with gold sparkly stars.

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:03.940 align:middle line:90%
Your ancestors welcome you.

00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Your past life
selves welcome you.

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:08.710 align:middle line:84%
They're already
out in the ocean,

00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:14.620 align:middle line:84%
together with the 12 Archangel
kingdoms of the Central Sun.

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Many, many, many
Ascended Masters gather.

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And we welcome you to
come out into the ocean

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:27.090 align:middle line:90%
and swim like a dolphin.

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And as you do, you just say,
I release my fear of fear.

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:41.590 align:middle line:84%
I release my fear that if I am
not afraid, I will be harmed.

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:45.670 align:middle line:84%
We give you this because it
is the most ridiculous, most

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:51.150 align:middle line:90%
potent, most viral fear of all.

00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:54.270 align:middle line:84%
The fear that if you are not
afraid, you will not be safe.

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:56.890 align:middle line:90%


00:46:56.890 --> 00:47:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And then many, many other
fears, beliefs, wounds, hurts,

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:05.820 align:middle line:90%
baggage will come up.

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:09.170 align:middle line:84%
A simple mantra,
just an intention.

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:12.080 align:middle line:84%
I give all of this back
to the Central Sun.

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I give it all back
to my Creator.

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Choose your word for
God, beloved ones.

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And you will see the
ocean change color.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And once it becomes
golden and white,

00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:30.560 align:middle line:84%
and all the colors
of the rainbow

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:38.690 align:middle line:84%
fill up with this healing
love, and watch your movie,

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:45.740 align:middle line:84%
your reality change
immediately, because you see,

00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:47.540 align:middle line:90%
you are a vessel.

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And where there is fear,
there is the ability

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:58.130 align:middle line:84%
to attract in negative
less-than-heavenly experiences.

00:47:58.130 --> 00:48:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you are
clear and filled

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:08.200 align:middle line:84%
with love, what you
attract in, beloved beings,

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.540 align:middle line:90%
is heaven on Earth.

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:13.600 align:middle line:90%
And this is your birthright.

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:17.610 align:middle line:90%
Let it go, that old baggage.

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:21.790 align:middle line:84%
What you don't
understand is that 90%

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:29.580 align:middle line:84%
of what you are using to
create your lives is baggage.

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:34.880 align:middle line:90%
Work with new material.

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Work with the material of
love, beautiful beings.

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Move beyond any
conspiracy theories,

00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:48.560 align:middle line:84%
and find your power
to manifest the life

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.070 align:middle line:90%
that you deserve to live.

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:56.470 align:middle line:84%
One of the issues we also
have that comes under somewhat

00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:59.140 align:middle line:84%
of the same heading
is that there

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:02.350 align:middle line:84%
seems to be an imbalance,
oftentimes, in our lives.

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:04.975 align:middle line:84%
We seem to compensate
for giving and receiving

00:49:04.975 --> 00:49:10.300 align:middle line:84%
of affection, love, loving
attention to one another.

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes in relationships,
we actually make the excuse

00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:15.490 align:middle line:90%
that it's symbiotic.

00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:17.470 align:middle line:90%
You have a beloved and a lover.

00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:19.420 align:middle line:90%
You have a giver and a taker.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:22.870 align:middle line:84%
But it seems all it does
is keep us in this trap

00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:28.330 align:middle line:84%
where the giver can't learn to
define themselves and stand up

00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:31.000 align:middle line:84%
for themselves,
and the taker can't

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.280 align:middle line:84%
learn how to fulfill
themselves, because they've

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.390 align:middle line:90%
been given so much.

00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And this giving-taking cycle is
not symbiotic, it seems to me.

00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:43.840 align:middle line:84%
It's actually
keeping us in a trap.

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:47.090 align:middle line:84%
We need to both give
and receive, you say.

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Learn to give and
receive with grace.

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:57.670 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: To break through this
painful pattern in relationship

00:49:57.670 --> 00:50:02.010 align:middle line:84%
that many of you
call codependency,

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:09.360 align:middle line:84%
where one is sacrificing for the
other, to break through that,

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:12.930 align:middle line:90%
we speak to the caregiver.

00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:15.750 align:middle line:90%
We speak to the caretaker.

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:19.080 align:middle line:90%
We speak to those who sacrifice.

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:24.440 align:middle line:84%
We say to you that
there is a fear

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:29.090 align:middle line:84%
deep down within your
molecules that you

00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:32.340 align:middle line:90%
are afraid to be a taker.

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:37.370 align:middle line:84%
It really is that you
are afraid to be a taker.

00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:42.170 align:middle line:84%
What do we do with fear,
beautiful human students?

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:47.270 align:middle line:84%
We give it back to the
Central Sun, the heart of God.

00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:51.620 align:middle line:84%
We can put it in violent fire
so it can be transformed.

00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:52.550 align:middle line:90%
And we forgive it.

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:53.480 align:middle line:90%
It is fear.

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.340 align:middle line:90%
It is illusion.

00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:58.710 align:middle line:90%
That is your first step.

00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Release the fear that
you will ever be a taker.

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:06.930 align:middle line:84%
Step two is to call on the
Divine Mother, the Divine

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:09.590 align:middle line:90%
Feminine.

00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:15.380 align:middle line:84%
If you feel more comfortable,
call on Mother Gaia herself.

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth will
serve you well.

00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And ask the feminine to fill
you with her ability to receive.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:29.190 align:middle line:90%


00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:33.120 align:middle line:84%
The ability to
receive is the power

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:39.400 align:middle line:84%
to attract in, in
loving ways, what it is

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:42.550 align:middle line:90%
that you need and you desire.

00:51:42.550 --> 00:51:45.430 align:middle line:90%
You see, in every human being--

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:49.840 align:middle line:84%
you may not know this, so
we're excited to tell you,

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.180 align:middle line:90%
to remind you.

00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:57.800 align:middle line:84%
In every human being, there
is a child who wants to give.

00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, if that giving child has
been rejected over and over,

00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:05.620 align:middle line:90%
then that child becomes a taker.

00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:11.110 align:middle line:84%
If you want to know the formula
of what creates a taker, what

00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:15.640 align:middle line:84%
creates a narcissist,
what creates

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:19.870 align:middle line:84%
a super ego-centered
focused person who does not

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:24.100 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to think
or care about anyone else,

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:30.740 align:middle line:84%
it starts with a child
who tried to give.

00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And their giving was
rejected over and over.

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Surrender that
taker to our care.

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:45.850 align:middle line:10%
We have ways to help the
taker through helping

00:52:45.850 --> 00:52:47.200 align:middle line:10%
the child within.

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:54.660 align:middle line:84%
But you, the giver, we say to
you, everyone wants to give.

00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And every giver
needs a receiver.

00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:00.340 align:middle line:90%


00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:05.520 align:middle line:84%
It is like making
love, is it not?

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:09.270 align:middle line:84%
You do not know how
to receive if you

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:15.590 align:middle line:84%
have practice sacrificing
yourself for everyone else.

00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:17.730 align:middle line:90%
Honor this.

00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:19.380 align:middle line:90%
Come with us.

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Step within a
beautiful ruby fountain

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.430 align:middle line:90%
of Divine Mother's love energy.

00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Allow that ruby deliciousness--
it tastes like strawberry--

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:33.440 align:middle line:90%
to fill you.

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And to say thank you, thank
you, thank you, Divine Mother,

00:53:37.610 --> 00:53:42.820 align:middle line:84%
for receiving
through me, for me,

00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:50.300 align:middle line:84%
that which will restore balance
in my human everyday life.

00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:52.820 align:middle line:90%


00:53:52.820 --> 00:54:00.190 align:middle line:84%
It comes with 100% 12
Archangel guarantee, folks.

00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Try it, and bring
balance to your life,

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:11.630 align:middle line:84%
and balance to your
beautiful Mother Earth.

00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:15.920 align:middle line:84%
She is one of us,
Archangel Gaia,

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:19.598 align:middle line:84%
and she knows how to
help you to receive.

00:54:19.598 --> 00:54:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Hm.

00:54:21.350 --> 00:54:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, and I have
one final question.

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with the
genuine role and function

00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:33.470 align:middle line:84%
of the heart, and its ability
to really truly uplift

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:35.750 align:middle line:84%
not only ourselves,
but collectively,

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:37.950 align:middle line:90%
and the planet itself.

00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:39.560 align:middle line:90%
Gaia herself.

00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:40.820 align:middle line:90%
The role of the heart.

00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>> WOMACK: Regina.

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:46.790 align:middle line:84%
May we do a meditation
with your audience?

00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:47.960 align:middle line:90%
A very quick one?

00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:53.700 align:middle line:84%
>> WOMACK: Beloved human beings,
please close your eyes and take

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:54.553 align:middle line:90%
a deep breath.

00:54:54.553 --> 00:54:58.500 align:middle line:90%


00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.240 align:middle line:90%
And focus on your breathing.

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:03.140 align:middle line:90%


00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Feel the gentle rise
and fall of your chest.

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:11.470 align:middle line:90%


00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Find the beautiful child
that lives within you.

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:20.410 align:middle line:84%
If you need help, just
think of a photo of yourself

00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:23.330 align:middle line:90%
at a very young age.

00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are huge doors
right on your human heart.

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:32.220 align:middle line:90%


00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And on the count
of three, together

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:36.970 align:middle line:84%
with the 12 Archangels, we're
going to open those doors

00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:40.970 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
let the sorrow out.

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:44.150 align:middle line:90%
One, two, three.

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:48.745 align:middle line:90%
Open, open, open.

00:55:48.745 --> 00:55:51.420 align:middle line:90%
And breathe.

00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And say within, I
send all of the sorrow

00:55:56.500 --> 00:56:04.970 align:middle line:84%
in my heart from any lifetime,
and from any childhood,

00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:09.470 align:middle line:84%
and any sorrow from my
ancestors, or family members,

00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:14.650 align:middle line:84%
or friends, or
clients, that I carry,

00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:20.200 align:middle line:84%
I send it back to the
Central Sun right now.

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:25.585 align:middle line:84%
And in exchange, Central Sun,
heart of God, fill me with joy.

00:56:25.585 --> 00:56:28.200 align:middle line:90%


00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:32.190 align:middle line:90%
I give you my sorrow.

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:33.980 align:middle line:90%
I call back my joy.

00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:37.480 align:middle line:90%


00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:42.210 align:middle line:90%
Repeat, beautiful beings.

00:56:42.210 --> 00:56:47.066 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I call back my joy.

00:56:47.066 --> 00:56:50.400 align:middle line:90%


00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:55.990 align:middle line:84%
I call back the happiest
childhood I could ever

00:56:55.990 --> 00:57:02.300 align:middle line:90%
dream of to begin right now.

00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:10.350 align:middle line:84%
Go forth and experience the
power of your new heart.

00:57:10.350 --> 00:57:15.260 align:middle line:84%
You see, together with the
help of your Higher Self,

00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:22.370 align:middle line:84%
we have upped your
heart chakra so that you

00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:27.730 align:middle line:90%
can receive with trust and joy.

00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:30.730 align:middle line:84%
We thank you, thank
you, thank you, Regina,

00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:35.530 align:middle line:84%
for this wonderful
opportunity to commune

00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:39.910 align:middle line:90%
