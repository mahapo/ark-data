>>REGINA MEREDITH:
The people of Earth

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.640 align:middle line:10%
are in critical need of
wise guidance from within,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.500 align:middle line:10%
as narcissism is
becoming an epidemic.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.850 align:middle line:10%
Popular culture encourages at
the least self-centeredness

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:29.940 align:middle line:10%
in the extreme.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.830 align:middle line:84%
It's showing up as dysfunction
in families, friends, even

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:33.630 align:middle line:90%
in governments.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.860 align:middle line:90%
But help is here.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.950 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Linda Backman
returned from Egypt

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.740 align:middle line:10%
and has much wisdom to share
about these very topics.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.300 align:middle line:10%
So we need to dig
into, what is happening

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.020 align:middle line:10%
that is taking us so deep into
these narcissistic tendencies?

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.260 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, toxic
narcissism is what I call it.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.170 align:middle line:84%
What is happening that's
taking us so deep?

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And have you been able
to see from the higher

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.850 align:middle line:90%
realms' point of view?

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.970 align:middle line:90%
We know social media.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:01.870 align:middle line:90%
We know selfies.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.730 align:middle line:90%
We know media is encouraging it.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.712 align:middle line:84%
But there's got
to be more to it.

00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:08.670 align:middle line:10%
>>LINDA BACKMAN: I mean,
what I find in my work

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.610 align:middle line:10%
when I guide
regression is that we

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.230 align:middle line:10%
live on a planet of
moderately evolved souls.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.100 align:middle line:10%
And only more evolved souls
see that this is narcissism.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.120 align:middle line:10%
I think that moderately
evolved souls--

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.110 align:middle line:10%
it's as if the
guides of our planet

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.760 align:middle line:10%
are pushing souls to evolve.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.780 align:middle line:10%
But we make the free will
choice whether to evolve or not.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.670 align:middle line:10%
And that's our responsibility.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.680 align:middle line:10%
And I hazard to say that there
are incarnate souls, people,

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.740 align:middle line:10%
who aren't making those what
often are tough choices.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:90%
Evolving is not easy.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.550 align:middle line:84%
But I think that that's
what we're seeing, that it's

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.020 align:middle line:90%
more about me versus us.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It isn't.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And in your practice
through the years,

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.940 align:middle line:84%
aside even from
regression work, am

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.300 align:middle line:84%
I mistaken or has this
changed substantively?

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember
from childhood

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.050 align:middle line:84%
and growing up and
being a young adult,

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.730 align:middle line:90%
people didn't behave like this.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.740 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't always about the self.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.990 align:middle line:10%
We didn't put ourselves at
the center of the universe.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.620 align:middle line:10%
You had kids.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.250 align:middle line:10%
You had family.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.690 align:middle line:10%
You had parents.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:20.690 align:middle line:10%
You had friends.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.610 align:middle line:10%
And now, often,
this alarming trend

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.480 align:middle line:10%
is young families, parents,
cutting off complete contact

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.170 align:middle line:10%
with their parents and families.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't understand
why the need to separate

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.520 align:middle line:84%
in such a harsh and even
cruel way, which is--

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.720 align:middle line:90%
and it's everywhere now.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.830 align:middle line:90%
This is very common.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you must be seeing it.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, I think
that we've advanced

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:90%
so quickly with technology.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.200 align:middle line:90%
And families live apart now.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.300 align:middle line:84%
It used to be your
grandparents lived--

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.640 align:middle line:84%
even in my case, my grandparents
lived two blocks away.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:84%
My aunt and uncle
lived four blocks away.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Families don't live
that way anymore.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And so we have this
technology that says,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.290 align:middle line:84%
well, I can call you
and talk on FaceTime.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.130 align:middle line:10%
Or I can visit you once a year.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.290 align:middle line:10%
But we don't have that
integrated family.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's a lot
of independence pushed

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.570 align:middle line:84%
on young people to
make their own choices

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.260 align:middle line:84%
and not have this sense of
responsibility, of caring

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.725 align:middle line:90%
for one another.

00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Definitely.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the
things that strikes me--

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and I noticed this even in
the young women around me.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.380 align:middle line:90%
I have wonderful young nieces.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.570 align:middle line:84%
They all have little
babies and such now.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.650 align:middle line:10%
But they do not
want any guidance

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.640 align:middle line:10%
from the previous generation.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.330 align:middle line:84%
They can learn it all
on TikTok and Instagram.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.225 align:middle line:84%
Everything they need to know
is provided by their peers.

00:03:53.225 --> 00:03:55.710 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to talk
about that for a moment.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.090 align:middle line:84%
What happens when you disconnect
from layers of wisdom.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:84%
Just like a forest, when you
cut down all the old growth,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.960 align:middle line:84%
those little trees do
not grow up healthy.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.640 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the
knowledge and wisdom

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.240 align:middle line:90%
from previous generations.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think there's
a lack of understanding

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.560 align:middle line:84%
that our parents,
our grandparents

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.810 align:middle line:84%
have experience
and have knowledge.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.200 align:middle line:90%
And I don't think we see that.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Even in my generation,
we don't see that.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.030 align:middle line:90%
And there's so much--

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even relationships
of our parents

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.620 align:middle line:90%
and our grandparents--

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.810 align:middle line:84%
not that I think divorce is
an unnecessary circumstance

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.900 align:middle line:90%
for some people.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.260 align:middle line:84%
But there's so much of not
working through the issues.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And so many young
people are not being

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.620 align:middle line:84%
raised by people that
are focused on family

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.000 align:middle line:90%
and on raising kids.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.060 align:middle line:84%
I had a guest years
ago, AndrÃ© Avila.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying,
what's with you people?

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.400 align:middle line:90%
He's from Italy.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.700 align:middle line:84%
In Italy, it takes a
village to raise a child.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.360 align:middle line:90%
The grandparents are there.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Yours are off renting a
condo and playing golf.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.370 align:middle line:84%
What happened to
the grandparents?

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah, no,
I think that's true.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I see this
in our culture.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I was raised in
that old world way with--

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.430 align:middle line:84%
I saw one set of grandparents
every other Sunday

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.090 align:middle line:84%
because they lived
60 miles away.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.890 align:middle line:84%
The others, I would walk
to visit them every Sunday

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.800 align:middle line:84%
after I went to Sunday
school and eat lunch

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.515 align:middle line:90%
with my grandparents.

00:05:36.515 --> 00:05:39.830 align:middle line:10%
But I would hazard to
say that some of us--

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.740 align:middle line:10%
and some of this exists in my
personal life with children

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.330 align:middle line:10%
and grandchildren--

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.955 align:middle line:10%
we don't necessarily live across
the street from each other.

00:05:47.955 --> 00:05:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It doesn't
mean you can't be close.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:50.460 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: That's right.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what's
changed, is the lack of desire

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.450 align:middle line:84%
to be close in a good
number of cases now.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.400 align:middle line:10%
And what I talked
about a moment ago,

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.540 align:middle line:10%
this perception of having
knowledge because one

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:09.180 align:middle line:10%
is flooded with imagery and pop
culture through social media

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.180 align:middle line:10%
in particular, it's
just giving a perception

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.620 align:middle line:10%
that they have a
lot of knowledge,

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:10%
completely disconnected
from the flow

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.390 align:middle line:10%
of cosmic and
generational knowledge.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.230 align:middle line:10%
And that seems to me to
be ultimately a deficit.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And also, it silos
people into a notion

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.860 align:middle line:84%
that your preferences
can all be met.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.710 align:middle line:84%
You were talking
about this before.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:84%
People don't want to
face the hard issues.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.877 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when you have
clients, young clients, that

00:06:35.877 --> 00:06:39.510 align:middle line:84%
show up and like, basically,
the world is not forming itself

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.580 align:middle line:90%
around me?

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.400 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: Well, I mean,
I think that's part of it,

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.490 align:middle line:10%
is that we make it
a "me generation".

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:53.380 align:middle line:10%
We make it, what can
you do for yourself?

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Or what kind of
car can you have?

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.440 align:middle line:10%
Versus what's your
responsibility to your parents,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.870 align:middle line:10%
to your grandparents, to your
neighbors, to other people

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:04.670 align:middle line:10%
in the world?

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.450 align:middle line:10%
And so there are
a lot of choices

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.520 align:middle line:10%
that are being made
that aren't necessarily

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.670 align:middle line:10%
the most healthy choices.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.070 align:middle line:10%
But I think that we as the--

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.530 align:middle line:10%
if I can put it this way,
the older generation,

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.280 align:middle line:10%
we need to model relationship.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And sadly, I think
even a lot of adults

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.850 align:middle line:84%
well into their adult
years aren't modeling.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you look at a lot
of the movies and television

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.570 align:middle line:84%
shows that come out now, the
Gen Z's are the smart ones.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Their parents are the
irresponsible, stupid ones,

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.110 align:middle line:90%
their grandparents even dumber.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.120 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it's all set up.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.500 align:middle line:90%
You said "me generation".

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, the Boomers are
the "me generation," Pluto.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And so that was a very
rebellious generation.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.850 align:middle line:10%
That's when divorce started
really proliferating

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.730 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of kids raised by
single parents and so forth.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.810 align:middle line:10%
And as you talk about
dealing with their parents,

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.120 align:middle line:10%
dating other people,
not the norm--

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.820 align:middle line:10%
the old norm of stability.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I think now, this kind
of toxic, narcissistic effect

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.570 align:middle line:84%
of going even
deeper into me, me,

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.360 align:middle line:84%
me, me, is this
something you think--

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.045 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going to switch
over into the ancient cultures.

00:08:12.045 --> 00:08:14.420 align:middle line:10%
Do you think this is something
in these times that almost

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:18.170 align:middle line:10%
had to happen to force a deep
healing, just like what you're

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.740 align:middle line:10%
seeing in our governments
around the world, kind

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:26.365 align:middle line:10%
of trying to re-entrench
in old, separatist ways?

00:08:26.365 --> 00:08:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well,
I know there are

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.820 align:middle line:84%
a lot of teachers
who are saying,

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:38.299 align:middle line:84%
oh, we had to hit this
narcissistic shift of we're

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:40.520 align:middle line:84%
going to take care
of the moneyed people

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.490 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm not totally sure
I agree with that.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.660 align:middle line:84%
But part of that's because
what I do in my life

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:52.080 align:middle line:84%
is guiding people to understand
who are they in their past lives

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.440 align:middle line:84%
and what's their
intention in life today.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think what we find is that
so many people aren't focused

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.730 align:middle line:90%
on how can they aid others.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:06.550 align:middle line:90%
It's, again, how can I aid me?

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:07.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:08.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.710 align:middle line:90%
Now, we're going to go back.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to start
looking into the souls, why

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:13.770 align:middle line:90%
they're here.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to
do it through the lens

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.510 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient Egyptian
culture and much

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:20.830 align:middle line:84%
of what was left
for us from them.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:24.640 align:middle line:84%
You went there earlier
in this year, 2025.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.600 align:middle line:10%
So let's start
talking about what you

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.170 align:middle line:10%
noticed among the participants.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:33.300 align:middle line:10%
Many of them, I'm guessing,
had been there before--

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.360 align:middle line:10%
had lives there before.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And that was part of
their deep curiosity?

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, it's
an interesting question.

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I noticed--
the last two years,

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.420 align:middle line:84%
I have co-led with a colleague
who's an Egyptologist.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.680 align:middle line:84%
The last two years, I've
co-led a group to Egypt.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.920 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
Egypt is popular.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.980 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
it's this person

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and that person are
taking groups to Egypt.

00:09:58.010 --> 00:09:59.800 align:middle line:84%
What I'm afraid
they're not doing

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.680 align:middle line:84%
is taking time in
these ancient sites

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.040 align:middle line:84%
to step into the
ancient energy of what

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.450 align:middle line:84%
was intended in that
culture and to utilize it

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:84%
for the growth of the
individuals in the group

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.760 align:middle line:90%
so that can affect more people.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.170 align:middle line:10%
So what I'm learning from other
people going on certain tours

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.333 align:middle line:10%
is that each day
is packed with--

00:10:22.333 --> 00:10:24.250 align:middle line:10%
well, first, we're going
to go to this temple.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:25.917 align:middle line:10%
And then we're going
to go to this site.

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:31.780 align:middle line:10%
But there's no time taken
to immerse in that energy

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:37.400 align:middle line:10%
and understand, what did
the ancients wish for--

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.810 align:middle line:10%
what's the wisdom of the
ancient dynasties of Egypt?

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And so we can't just
rush to each temple.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.670 align:middle line:90%
And, oh, I see this.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:47.470 align:middle line:90%
I see that.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.670 align:middle line:84%
It's, so how is
this affecting me?

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:55.100 align:middle line:10%
And that was the goal
of these two tours.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.960 align:middle line:10%
And I found that this year--

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.090 align:middle line:10%
I'd never been to
Egypt before last year.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:03.360 align:middle line:10%
I found that this year I was
having more deep experiences,

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.130 align:middle line:10%
I think partly because I'd been
there before just last year.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like I was
more comfortable in the energy

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.240 align:middle line:84%
and the guides were
downloading for me as well as

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.570 align:middle line:90%
for others in the group.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:22.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's focus in
on some of the deeper insights

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.890 align:middle line:84%
you had because many of the
people I've interviewed,

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.940 align:middle line:84%
certainly people I was
surrounded with in Sedona,

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.910 align:middle line:84%
we recognized each other
from Egyptian times.

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Many people are back
from those times.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were in
the priestly class.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.840 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were in
the royal classes.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were in
neither and were more

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.240 align:middle line:90%
in service classes of the day.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And each brings a different
perspective to it.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.400 align:middle line:84%
So let's dive into your own
experience and your own insights

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.200 align:middle line:90%
first.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, I'll
share what happened,

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.640 align:middle line:90%
which I was unsuspecting.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's a
classic analogy of what we

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.640 align:middle line:90%
have to be doing in our life.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:08.770 align:middle line:84%
So this year, our group
had a two-hour private time

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.330 align:middle line:84%
in the King's Chamber
in the Great Pyramid.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.460 align:middle line:10%
And getting into
the Great Pyramid,

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.950 align:middle line:10%
For Anyone who's been there
or who hasn't been there,

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:19.690 align:middle line:10%
the shaft to get all the
way into the King's Chamber

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.260 align:middle line:10%
is challenging,
especially as a person--

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.610 align:middle line:10%
I'm not 30, 40, or 50 anymore.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was bound and
determined, as my husband was.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:29.980 align:middle line:90%
He was with me.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.605 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he had
to fold himself up

00:12:31.605 --> 00:12:32.840 align:middle line:90%
because he's a tall man.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.380 align:middle line:90%
You're sweet girl.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.820 align:middle line:90%
And we were concerned.

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.210 align:middle line:84%
But both the
co-leader and others

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:42.740 align:middle line:84%
said they would make
sure and help us.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.900 align:middle line:84%
But my husband and I
were both determined

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.570 align:middle line:84%
we would make our way
into the King's Chamber.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And believe it or not, without
any assistance, both of us

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:53.330 align:middle line:90%
made it in.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:58.530 align:middle line:10%
But the point, Regina, was
almost like determination.

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:02.000 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like I could
feel my guide saying,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.100 align:middle line:84%
you need to be there with
the whole group this time.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.350 align:middle line:84%
No, you-- yeah, you
need to be there.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:08.750 align:middle line:90%
So I managed.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it was somewhat
easier than I thought.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Do you go on
your belly and elbows?

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.290 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: No, it's a kind of a
squatting sort of a situation.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Scootching
along in a squat?

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.603 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Even though the--

00:13:21.603 --> 00:13:23.395 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you have
to have decent knees.

00:13:23.395 --> 00:13:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: You have to
have decent knees, yes.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.490 align:middle line:84%
But you could always have a
person on either side of you

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:30.030 align:middle line:90%
if you needed that.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Nonetheless, I made
it in on my own steam.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And then you come in
to where the mummy

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.940 align:middle line:84%
of that particular pharaoh is
no longer in the sarcophagus.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:47.880 align:middle line:10%
But you come into this large
cathedral ceilinged stone

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.210 align:middle line:10%
chamber, where the
energy is amazing.

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.880 align:middle line:10%
And so the group came in.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.700 align:middle line:10%
We all sat down around
the sarcophagus.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.380 align:middle line:10%
My colleague began to teach.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.500 align:middle line:84%
My colleague is an
interplanetary soul.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm an Earth-based soul.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.010 align:middle line:90%
So my colleague began to teach.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.820 align:middle line:84%
She is one of the more tapped
in people that I've ever

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.120 align:middle line:90%
come into contact with.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:14.110 align:middle line:84%
At times, I have to ask
her to translate her terms.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.640 align:middle line:90%
But she began to teach.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And then we just
bounced off each other.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.690 align:middle line:90%
She spoke.

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:20.530 align:middle line:90%
I spoke.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:23.940 align:middle line:10%
But as I was in the chamber,
and because I understand

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.850 align:middle line:10%
from regression about the
purpose of Earth-based souls,

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:30.750 align:middle line:10%
interplanetary souls,
and angelic souls,

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.970 align:middle line:10%
my guides began to speak to me.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And they began to
explain why I was--

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.640 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't literally arm
in arm with my colleague.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.390 align:middle line:84%
But it felt that way as
we talked back and forth.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And they began to
talk to me about what

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:48.520 align:middle line:84%
they feel is lacking
currently on the planet

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:55.600 align:middle line:84%
and how the guides of Earth,
how they intend to impact Earth.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And they began to
talk about the need

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:02.020 align:middle line:84%
for more interplanetary
souls and more angelic souls

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.560 align:middle line:84%
coming into body on
Earth because these are

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.460 align:middle line:90%
advanced souls of great wisdom.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And these are usually
ancient souls that

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.120 align:middle line:90%
have been around a long time.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.810 align:middle line:84%
So they began to talk to
me about how many would

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:16.390 align:middle line:84%
come through the birth process,
how many of these souls

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:18.730 align:middle line:90%
would be walk-ins.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:22.820 align:middle line:84%
They began to describe
the walk-in process to me.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And again, after
coming home, I felt

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:30.485 align:middle line:84%
like this information needed to
be spread in a broader manner.

00:15:30.485 --> 00:15:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I was
excited to hear about it.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So we'll get into
that more deeply.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:38.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, what did your
IP colleague have

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.690 align:middle line:84%
to share while she
was in there, as you

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.020 align:middle line:90%
were going back and forth?

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.310 align:middle line:90%
What was her piece of it?

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.077 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, my
IP colleague, my IP--

00:15:45.077 --> 00:15:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interplanetary, just
for anyone that doesn't already

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.390 align:middle line:90%
know the terms.

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
get more into it.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Good.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.840 align:middle line:90%
And maybe just for people--

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.940 align:middle line:90%
so we say this.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:55.400 align:middle line:84%
The term interplanetary
was given to me

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.780 align:middle line:90%
years ago in regression.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.400 align:middle line:90%
It's the same as ET.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.090 align:middle line:90%
It's the same as starseed.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Those all mean the same, just
so people comprehend that.

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:10.040 align:middle line:10%
My interplanetary colleague has
had more than one incarnation

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.390 align:middle line:10%
in Egypt.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:15.200 align:middle line:10%
And Egypt in those
times is a unique time

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.820 align:middle line:10%
when souls could materialize
in an adult body.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And souls could dematerialize
from an adult body.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.210 align:middle line:84%
I've known for years
that that no longer

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:29.390 align:middle line:84%
happens, that it's
simply energetically

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:31.620 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't occur anymore.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.900 align:middle line:84%
But she has been there
many, many times.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.010 align:middle line:84%
She knows of her connection
with various pharaohs

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.790 align:middle line:90%
and the role she played.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And she just slips right
into those memories.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So she's sharing the memories
and the wisdom that in some ways

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.250 align:middle line:90%
is not lost permanently.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:55.060 align:middle line:84%
But we've lost from conscious
and tapping into it.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:58.540 align:middle line:10%
And then I, being
the Earth based-soul,

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:02.250 align:middle line:10%
often ground it for the
group so they understand

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:05.369 align:middle line:10%
what she's explaining.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:08.928 align:middle line:84%
And so we're a little bit of a
dog and pony show, if you will.

00:17:08.928 --> 00:17:10.720 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no,
it's a nice complement.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.770 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah, it's
a beautiful complement.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:17.280 align:middle line:10%
So I sort of play the
role of, let's put this

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:22.403 align:middle line:10%
into literal understanding
of right now.

00:17:22.403 --> 00:17:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, before
we go into that,

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:27.540 align:middle line:90%
what's striking me is this.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.790 align:middle line:84%
People go to Egypt
oftentimes because they

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:33.070 align:middle line:84%
want to re-experience
the frequencies.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:40.890 align:middle line:84%
One well-known person has
privately assessed that they

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:42.670 align:middle line:90%
thought the pyramids were--

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:45.830 align:middle line:84%
the Great Pyramid was
closer to 100,000 years old.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the hermetic texts,
they believe it's about closer

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:53.030 align:middle line:90%
to 85,000 years old.

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:56.590 align:middle line:84%
This would be concurrent
with the Atlantean culture

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.800 align:middle line:90%
of the day.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And the people had
access to both places.

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:04.060 align:middle line:84%
So knowledge was being shared
between Atlantis and Egypt,

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:04.860 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.860 align:middle line:10%
But what I'm wondering is this.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:10.450 align:middle line:10%
If that's true and the
date is that far back,

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.310 align:middle line:10%
we can't conceive what
the original purpose was.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.380 align:middle line:10%
We can only feel it, right?

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And so when we go there now,
is enough of that frequency

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.360 align:middle line:90%
still intact?

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Because the frequencies have
changed over the last 100,000

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:24.192 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:18:24.192 --> 00:18:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Is enough of it there that you
can still really tap in deeply?

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well, I think
there's the hard part

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.200 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:39.440 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at, we might
say, left brain history,

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:44.460 align:middle line:84%
left brain history says that
the first Egyptian dynasty began

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:48.220 align:middle line:84%
somewhere between
3,000 and 2,600 BCE.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well,
I think the no--

00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:55.890 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's where
it becomes complicated-- is

00:18:55.890 --> 00:19:00.150 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge, the wisdom
has existed for perhaps long

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:04.290 align:middle line:84%
before the pyramids were built.
So the knowledge and wisdom

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:08.620 align:middle line:84%
of that era of time
existed for a long time.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I would hazard to say
the frequencies are available.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.970 align:middle line:84%
But when we go there, we have
to be willing to open ourselves

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.150 align:middle line:90%
to the frequencies.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm wondering,

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.170 align:middle line:84%
if your just rushing through,
taking snapshots, lying

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.520 align:middle line:84%
down in the sarcophagus,
and say, wow, that was cool,

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.432 align:middle line:90%
you're missing it.

00:19:26.432 --> 00:19:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: I think that's what
happens with some people on some

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.760 align:middle line:90%
of their trips to Egypt.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:36.810 align:middle line:10%
So now, let's get further
into what you were shown

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:40.850 align:middle line:10%
and the way this is going
to manifest into our future,

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:44.590 align:middle line:10%
with more of the IP souls
and angelic souls coming in

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:48.700 align:middle line:10%
to help us through this really
critical period of history.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well,
I think the point

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:52.660 align:middle line:84%
is that a lot of people--
it's partly why I do

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.130 align:middle line:84%
regression-- that
a lot of people

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:59.510 align:middle line:84%
don't understand who they
are at the soul level.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's not to say it's easy
to be an Earth-based soul

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.810 align:middle line:90%
because it isn't always easy.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:10.630 align:middle line:84%
But there are more and more
interplanetary and angelic souls

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:12.910 align:middle line:90%
coming into body on Earth.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:14.620 align:middle line:90%
But they know they're different.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Or you or we, however I want to
put that, know they're different

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:22.250 align:middle line:84%
and don't understand
their unique challenges,

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.680 align:middle line:84%
don't understand
their dietary issues,

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.390 align:middle line:84%
their physiological
issues or information

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:30.700 align:middle line:84%
they receive that
they think is strange

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.670 align:middle line:84%
or they don't know why
they get these odd dreams

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:35.270 align:middle line:90%
or odd downloads.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:40.850 align:middle line:10%
And so the point is
helping those people who

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:44.490 align:middle line:10%
come IP souls in body,
angelic realm souls in body,

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:48.000 align:middle line:10%
helping them understand
themselves, accept themselves,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.730 align:middle line:10%
and know what their
purpose is, know

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.320 align:middle line:10%
why they are the way they are.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.380 align:middle line:10%
Because IPs and angelic--

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.280 align:middle line:10%
what I call ARs,
Angelic Realm souls--

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.340 align:middle line:10%
they know they're unique
and don't fit as easily

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.615 align:middle line:10%
into our human culture.

00:21:03.615 --> 00:21:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
obviously that's part

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:09.560 align:middle line:84%
of why you incarnated, is to be
able to help them process this

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and understand their
role in the world

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.910 align:middle line:84%
but also identify others who
have been around for a while.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:18.530 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I'm one of those IPs
who's been around forever--

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:20.090 align:middle line:10%
a long tour of duty here--

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:22.700 align:middle line:10%
to help also help
people understand

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:25.200 align:middle line:10%
what those feelings
are, what it feels like,

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.370 align:middle line:10%
and to be OK with certain
things because you don't ever

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:31.970 align:middle line:10%
fit in exactly the
same way and EB does.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Right.

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.880 align:middle line:10%
And it requires parents,
friends, family members,

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:42.390 align:middle line:10%
grandparents, neighbors not
misinterpreting or judging

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.070 align:middle line:10%
that person--

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:48.400 align:middle line:10%
IP, AR-- why they
are the way they are.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And I find that's
part of the problem,

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:55.135 align:middle line:84%
is that we mislabel those,
especially children.

00:21:55.135 --> 00:21:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:57.940 align:middle line:84%
You're always on
the outside bet.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can take my own
experience growing up,

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.210 align:middle line:84%
which was when my father
first got to know me--

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.620 align:middle line:84%
by the time I was one and
walking, his name for me

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.090 align:middle line:90%
was Wagon Wheel.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:10.330 align:middle line:90%
That was his nickname.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And the reason was because
he said, I don't know why,

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.240 align:middle line:84%
but it's like you
already knew everything.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you were like
an old wagon wheel who

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.280 align:middle line:90%
had seen that road many times.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.080 align:middle line:90%
So he called me Wagon Wheel.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:27.940 align:middle line:84%
But the functional reality
was that I didn't fit in,

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.960 align:middle line:84%
I will not participate in
class, won't raise a hand,

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.350 align:middle line:90%
just always feeling invisible.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.610 align:middle line:90%
But I was OK with it.

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they didn't
think it was OK.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:40.962 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying
this because I know

00:22:40.962 --> 00:22:43.420 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of other people
like me out there listening

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.770 align:middle line:84%
to this, where you don't
want to participate.

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.390 align:middle line:90%
You don't even want to be seen.

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the
notion of invisibility

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:51.700 align:middle line:90%
feels very comfortable.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Well,
I think-- and I'm

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.640 align:middle line:90%
going to leave names out here.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:00.130 align:middle line:84%
But I think we have people
on this planet, leaders

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:04.400 align:middle line:84%
on this planet that at
times are labeled as,

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.260 align:middle line:90%
why is that person not tuned in?

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.670 align:middle line:10%
Why is that person
seeming not to recognize

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:11.390 align:middle line:10%
someone or something?

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:15.820 align:middle line:10%
Because that person has the
ability to tap into what

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.076 align:middle line:10%
I might call downloads.

00:23:17.076 --> 00:23:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: I recently watched--

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.350 align:middle line:90%
again, I'll leave labels out--

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:middle line:84%
watched a limited
series, a story

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:30.470 align:middle line:84%
about two Black young people
striving to get into college.

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:35.060 align:middle line:84%
But one had incredible gifts
from a music standpoint.

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.550 align:middle line:10%
But because we put
down certain cultures,

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:42.110 align:middle line:10%
there was the pressure
for this young man, who

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:47.180 align:middle line:10%
was musically capable, to play
sports and get into a university

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.860 align:middle line:10%
in order to play sports.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a good
analogy for what this is.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
work to be more

00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:00.770 align:middle line:84%
accepting of people that don't,
what I say, fit into a box.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And so your father saw
you as the wagon wheel.

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:07.637 align:middle line:84%
But other people probably
saw you as, well,

00:24:07.637 --> 00:24:08.970 align:middle line:90%
why doesn't she want to do this?

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Or why doesn't she
want to do that?

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is she weird.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.120 align:middle line:10%
Why doesn't she speak up.

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.430 align:middle line:10%
But I was always watching.

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:16.820 align:middle line:10%
I watched everybody
and everything.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.250 align:middle line:84%
So I was always observing
how people behaved

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:21.810 align:middle line:84%
and what was going on even when
I was four or five years old.

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:24.290 align:middle line:84%
I was curious about
how people behaved.

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:25.320 align:middle line:90%
Still am.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, it
makes me think about--

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:29.390 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not an IP or an AR.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:31.230 align:middle line:84%
As I've said, I'm
an Earth-based soul.

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:33.780 align:middle line:84%
But I have a cousin
who says to me--

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:36.040 align:middle line:84%
a cousin who's like four
years older than I am.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And he says to me, when
I knew you growing up,

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.000 align:middle line:90%
you were like mute.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.672 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't literally mute.

00:24:41.672 --> 00:24:42.880 align:middle line:90%
It's not like I didn't speak.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.960 align:middle line:84%
But he said, your
personality didn't show.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.360 align:middle line:90%
You were kind of under yourself.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And my sense
knowing myself today

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.160 align:middle line:90%
is that I also was an observer.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: And I also
think that I wasn't

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:58.810 align:middle line:90%
conscious of knowing things.

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:01.763 align:middle line:84%
But I think I just
didn't quite want

00:25:01.763 --> 00:25:02.930 align:middle line:90%
to step into the mainstream.

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:03.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:05.190 align:middle line:90%
No, I understand that.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:08.010 align:middle line:90%
So now, as many more--

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:10.890 align:middle line:84%
a higher percentage of IP
and angelic-realm souls--

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:13.090 align:middle line:90%
are moving into physical form--

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:17.490 align:middle line:84%
we've touched on this before
in a previous interview.

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:21.000 align:middle line:84%
They're often being labeled
as dysfunctional in some way,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.970 align:middle line:90%
particularly on the spectrum.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Right.

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And let's also talk
about how they're

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.420 align:middle line:84%
going to come in because I was
getting downloads about some

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.670 align:middle line:84%
coming in through the
birth process and some

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:34.850 align:middle line:84%
not coming in through
the birth process.

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:38.710 align:middle line:90%
So yes, it's like--

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:41.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say sadly
because it isn't sad

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:44.770 align:middle line:84%
if the greater population
wouldn't see it as sad.

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:49.690 align:middle line:84%
But some of these IPs
and ARs are being labeled

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:51.200 align:middle line:90%
on the autistic spectrum.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.670 align:middle line:10%
They haven't been
in body many times.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:58.670 align:middle line:84%
They're being labeled
as learning challenges.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:25:59.900 align:middle line:90%
Again, why?

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.960 align:middle line:10%
Because they learn differently.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.410 align:middle line:10%
There's nothing wrong with them.

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.220 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: They can
learn through osmosis.

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a whole
different way of learning.

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:08.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Totally.

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They don't need to
open up a book or watch a video.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.690 align:middle line:84%
They can simply be in
the presence of something

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:17.780 align:middle line:84%
and begin absorbing many
of them-- not all but many.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And they learn-- their
perceptual abilities

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.620 align:middle line:90%
are different.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:29.230 align:middle line:84%
But we as humans, and especially
in certain countries where we're

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:31.450 align:middle line:84%
more narrow-- and I
think the United States

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:35.760 align:middle line:84%
is like this-- where we
expect people to almost look

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.620 align:middle line:90%
a bit like clones of each other.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:42.510 align:middle line:10%
And that's not going to
serve humanity's advancement

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.210 align:middle line:10%
to expect, in this
case, young people,

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:47.500 align:middle line:10%
to look like clones
of each other.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And then you have Ra, who
created the Human Design System

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:55.800 align:middle line:84%
and Richard Rudd carrying
it on and refining it

00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:00.960 align:middle line:84%
and others saying 2026 in
particular is going to be even.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Christopher Bledsoe, who
talks with "The Lady"--

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.310 align:middle line:84%
"The Lady" has come
to him many times,

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:08.800 align:middle line:84%
who is from another
realm, another planet.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And 2026 seems to
be a year where

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:16.290 align:middle line:84%
it's going to become very clear
that humanity has changed,

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:18.840 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
foundationally, fundamentally

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:22.750 align:middle line:84%
be different, a different kind
of species as human beings.

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And I keep thinking back
to you and thinking,

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.450 align:middle line:84%
I think it's
because so many more

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:29.520 align:middle line:84%
beings from these
other dimensions

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.850 align:middle line:84%
are going to be inhabiting
the physical body.

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Societies, the way people
think and relate to each other,

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:36.870 align:middle line:90%
is going to be very different.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:39.210 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I try to
imagine things like,

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:42.020 align:middle line:10%
if you're from a non-physical
realm, like myself,

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.120 align:middle line:10%
and you're here in a physical
body for the first time,

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.440 align:middle line:10%
how would you even relate
to something like partnering

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.210 align:middle line:10%
up and having sex
with another person?

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:53.150 align:middle line:10%
How does that even work?

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
be starting to see

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:57.750 align:middle line:84%
more and more of these kinds
of questions and challenges,

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:58.880 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Right.

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And as I piece what I've learned
over the years of guiding IP

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:11.300 align:middle line:84%
clients is that the variety
of unique qualities of IPs

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:15.320 align:middle line:84%
is broader than we can even
imagine because IPs come

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.190 align:middle line:90%
from so many different places.

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:21.350 align:middle line:84%
You speak of not coming
from a dense location.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:22.620 align:middle line:90%
That's common.

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:26.370 align:middle line:84%
But then there are IPs
that operate on spacecraft.

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And their level of technological
knowledge is off the charts.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also,
in terms of society,

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:36.810 align:middle line:84%
they've been able to
procreate through other means.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:38.580 align:middle line:84%
They're procreating
technologically.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.880 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be
seeded on this planet.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.370 align:middle line:10%
So I mean, we have
a very exciting time

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:46.210 align:middle line:10%
ahead but a lot of
adjustments necessary.

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Right.

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:49.880 align:middle line:84%
But what we have-- and
this is one of the pieces

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.440 align:middle line:84%
I thought was so
important to talk

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.960 align:middle line:84%
about-- is that more IPs
are going to be coming in.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And we'll start with talking
about mostly through the birth

00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:59.280 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And so moms and dads and
grandmas and grandpas

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.260 align:middle line:84%
and siblings and
teachers and whoever else

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:11.960 align:middle line:84%
are going to have to loosen
their expectations of,

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:16.820 align:middle line:84%
oh, you need to learn your
ABCs from A to Z or your colors

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:19.320 align:middle line:84%
by the time you're
four or whatever.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.230 align:middle line:90%
And that may not be--

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, we're going to
talk about the walk-in process

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:26.730 align:middle line:84%
because that's very
disconcerting for family

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:27.530 align:middle line:90%
members.

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:29.550 align:middle line:90%
Now, I want to back up.

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Let's go macro a bit more.

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So now, we're talking
about many people that

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.280 align:middle line:84%
are on this planet,
a number, are also

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:42.310 align:middle line:84%
involved in higher realms,
councils that oversee, how do we

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:45.550 align:middle line:84%
want to help the
process of evolution

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:47.270 align:middle line:90%
at this period of time?

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And there are interplanetary
beings on these councils.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.370 align:middle line:84%
All three groups are
on these councils.

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about them.

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah, I think this
is a wonderfully and key concept

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:01.330 align:middle line:84%
that we as people
interested in spirituality

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:02.900 align:middle line:90%
need to think about.

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:06.430 align:middle line:84%
So the first step with
that is understanding

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:07.780 align:middle line:90%
that we have a higher self.

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:13.240 align:middle line:10%
And for people that are
willing to tap in and live

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:17.230 align:middle line:10%
their lives this
way, we need to know

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:19.720 align:middle line:10%
our higher self
because our higher

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.500 align:middle line:10%
self is one of our guides.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.880 align:middle line:10%
If something changes with the
roles and responsibilities

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.380 align:middle line:10%
of our higher self
in the higher realm,

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:31.190 align:middle line:10%
if our role changes at,
what I call, the HS level,

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:33.100 align:middle line:10%
the Higher Self level,
then something's

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:36.770 align:middle line:10%
going to change for us at the
human level and then vice versa.

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:40.460 align:middle line:84%
If I decide I'm going
to write a new book

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.330 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to teach
a new course or I

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:46.090 align:middle line:84%
want to work with
different kinds of clients,

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:49.540 align:middle line:84%
as I make that change,
that's going to be reflected

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:52.520 align:middle line:84%
in my own higher self and
what I'll call it she--

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.020 align:middle line:84%
my higher self
doesn't have gender--

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.660 align:middle line:84%
but what she is doing
in the higher realm.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:00.560 align:middle line:10%
So when we're souls in
body, we have a higher self.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:05.680 align:middle line:10%
And that higher self has
coordination responsibilities

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.070 align:middle line:10%
in the spiritual realm.

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:09.170 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people don't
think about that.

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:12.490 align:middle line:10%
That's one of our
guides, our higher self.

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:14.830 align:middle line:10%
So what I know,
again, from regression

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:19.300 align:middle line:10%
is that higher selves have
experienced Earth-based souls

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:23.050 align:middle line:10%
serve on what we could call
a council or a parliament

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:28.730 align:middle line:10%
to do coordination work with
how these EB higher selves will

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:30.740 align:middle line:10%
do their best to guide Earth.

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:33.230 align:middle line:90%
How can they impact Earth?

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Then the angelic realm
has a high council.

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.750 align:middle line:10%
The IPs have a high council.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:44.580 align:middle line:84%
The angelic high council is
coordinated by the archangels.

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:49.310 align:middle line:10%
And primarily, the
archangels have a slight bit

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:54.180 align:middle line:10%
of a pecking order, Michael
being the lead archangel.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:57.920 align:middle line:84%
The Michael archangel soul
continues to incarnate

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and has for an
extremely long time.

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:08.150 align:middle line:84%
So the high council
of the angelic realm

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:12.710 align:middle line:84%
is basically helping our culture
have more love, compassion,

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:17.210 align:middle line:84%
non-judgment because the
angelic souls serve source.

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:22.223 align:middle line:84%
And they serve the broad love,
acceptance, and compassion--

00:32:22.223 --> 00:32:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Directive of love
throughout the universe.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:25.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:26.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:31.380 align:middle line:84%
The IPs are more complicated
in a way because the IP high

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:34.590 align:middle line:84%
council is made up--
it's a little bit like--

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:38.350 align:middle line:84%
I hate to use this example but
the US House of Representatives.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:42.480 align:middle line:10%
So the IP council
is made up of souls

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:47.430 align:middle line:10%
from innumerable locations
in the broad celestial realm.

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:52.360 align:middle line:10%
And those locations have to be
willing to want to help humanity

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:56.790 align:middle line:10%
because the IP council attempts
to serve in all the ways they

00:32:56.790 --> 00:33:01.020 align:middle line:10%
can come up with-- to serve
the expansion of Earth.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.620 align:middle line:84%
So the IP council has
experienced Earth-based souls

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:08.760 align:middle line:84%
and experienced IP souls
and is coordinated--

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.630 align:middle line:84%
the facilitator of
that council changes.

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:16.170 align:middle line:84%
One of the souls that has led
that council many, many times

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:19.860 align:middle line:90%
is the soul known as Maitreya.

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:23.440 align:middle line:10%
One of the oldest,
if not the oldest,

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.880 align:middle line:10%
most experienced
Earth-based souls

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:31.770 align:middle line:10%
that hasn't incarnated since
about the Third Dynasty in Egypt

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:35.570 align:middle line:10%
or where the oldest
pyramid is in Egypt,

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:39.650 align:middle line:10%
when Djoser was the pharaoh.

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:43.620 align:middle line:84%
So these councils do what
they can in the higher realm,

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.770 align:middle line:90%
essentially, to guide us--

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:48.620 align:middle line:90%
to guide EBs, IPS, and ARs--

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:52.530 align:middle line:84%
so that hopefully Earth
makes steps forward.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:54.710 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So it's really
critical too that--

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:56.990 align:middle line:10%
because that's a higher
mind aspect of beings

00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:00.620 align:middle line:10%
here, that they're able to
translate that information

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.780 align:middle line:10%
through to the conscious
mind of their host

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:06.600 align:middle line:10%
recipient, physical person,
avatar on the planet

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.560 align:middle line:10%
so that you can be of service.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.360 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Right.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so there's
that translation process.

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:12.679 align:middle line:84%
And I would assume
that must be part

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:15.739 align:middle line:84%
of the determining factor
of who is able to serve

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:16.620 align:middle line:90%
on those councils.

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:19.190 align:middle line:84%
There has to be some
enough awareness

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.210 align:middle line:84%
to translate between
higher mind and lower mind.

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:24.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
purpose of those councils,

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:28.000 align:middle line:84%
is to bring the higher
wisdom to Earth.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.810 align:middle line:10%
What I know about
the IP locations is

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:37.960 align:middle line:10%
that the coordinators of each
IP location has to decide,

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:41.070 align:middle line:10%
are they even interested
in sending a representative

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:42.280 align:middle line:10%
to the IP council?

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.170 align:middle line:10%
Do they even care
about Earth's progress.

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:49.469 align:middle line:84%
But what I often say to
clients is, especially

00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:51.360 align:middle line:84%
when clients start
talking about-- there

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.610 align:middle line:84%
is no time, that everything
is happening all at once.

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And I say that is
not true on Earth.

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:59.335 align:middle line:90%
On Earth, we are functioning--

00:34:59.335 --> 00:35:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We are subject
to gravity and time.

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Exactly, exactly.

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only way we
will evolve, is in real time.

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:05.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So there
are some IP locations

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.310 align:middle line:84%
that may have been
requested to consider

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:12.790 align:middle line:90%
sending a representative.

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:14.410 align:middle line:90%
But perhaps they're not ready.

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps they're
not interested.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:21.630 align:middle line:84%
But the wisdom of IP
locations is vast.

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's where
there's confusion about dates,

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:29.122 align:middle line:84%
is that the wisdom has existed
long before we probably--

00:35:29.122 --> 00:35:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From the beginning.

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From the beginning.

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.840 align:middle line:10%
Now, let's talk about this
somewhat problematic notion

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:40.760 align:middle line:10%
of coming as an IP
or angelic walk-in

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:45.780 align:middle line:10%
into an already developed body
that has its own soul force.

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:48.300 align:middle line:10%
And it's a very
interesting process.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.470 align:middle line:10%
And honestly, my soul group
says this has actually

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:53.400 align:middle line:10%
been very rare in the past.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.100 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't happen as
often as people claim.

00:35:56.100 --> 00:36:00.680 align:middle line:84%
But when it does, it is profound
and profoundly disturbing

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.640 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes to the
people around them.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.750 align:middle line:84%
Tell us the story so we can
start recognizing because it's

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:06.930 align:middle line:90%
going to be happening more.

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes.

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about,
what does that mean?

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:11.730 align:middle line:90%
What is a walk-in?

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And I also want
to separate apart

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:17.552 align:middle line:84%
walk-ins for IPs
versus walk-ins for ARs

00:36:17.552 --> 00:36:18.760 align:middle line:90%
because there's a difference.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: So a walk-in simply--
just so listeners understand

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.780 align:middle line:90%
this, a walk-in means that--

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.460 align:middle line:84%
obviously when
we're born and we're

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.710 align:middle line:84%
viable outside of
the womb, we have

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:35.790 align:middle line:84%
a soul that animates our
body, not a 100% of that soul.

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Or that would blow the
circuits of the human body.

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:39.500 align:middle line:90%
So we have--

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's got its
tendril down there.

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: --a holographic
portion of soul energy.

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:48.480 align:middle line:84%
So when we're born, that's what
causes us to live and breathe.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.300 align:middle line:84%
If a walk-in is
going to happen--

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.760 align:middle line:84%
and this is all decided
at the soul level--

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:58.080 align:middle line:84%
it means the original
animating soul of that human,

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.600 align:middle line:84%
that person steps
out of the body.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And a different
animating soul steps in.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.750 align:middle line:10%
It's always decided
first at the soul level.

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:14.480 align:middle line:10%
What I've learned recently is
that these IP walk-ins that are

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:18.650 align:middle line:10%
coming, because source
wishes for there to be more,

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:22.020 align:middle line:10%
are going to be where an--

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:25.170 align:middle line:10%
I am not a walk in, but to
use myself as an example--

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:30.270 align:middle line:10%
where my higher self
as an EB is going

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:35.130 align:middle line:10%
to be asked if my soul
is willing to step out

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:39.540 align:middle line:10%
and an IP soul
take over my body.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.250 align:middle line:90%
So there's always agreement.

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And this will be
happening for what

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:49.930 align:middle line:84%
were EB-animated humans
will be IP-animated.

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:53.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to happen
in large numbers in regard

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:54.090 align:middle line:90%
to walk-ins.

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:56.535 align:middle line:84%
Because as you just said,
it's a very challenging--

00:37:56.535 --> 00:37:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Very,
very challenging,

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:02.070 align:middle line:84%
complex topic where
literally the family--

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:05.140 align:middle line:84%
the person wakes up, they don't
have the same preferences.

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:06.577 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:38:06.577 --> 00:38:07.660 align:middle line:90%
They have the body memory.

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:11.160 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have
the memory of a lot

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.860 align:middle line:84%
of what their previous entity
has done, experience, prefers.

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:15.760 align:middle line:90%
And can you imagine?

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.670 align:middle line:84%
It's like having
amnesia to the family.

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:19.190 align:middle line:84%
Like, wow, what
happened to them?

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Right.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So people understand-- I'm
actually currently working with

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.510 align:middle line:90%
a client who--

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:28.330 align:middle line:84%
we are both sure
she is a walk-in.

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:36.940 align:middle line:84%
So there will be a value in
the case of this individual.

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:41.530 align:middle line:84%
As an EB before
she became an IP,

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:45.220 align:middle line:84%
she was struggling with all
kinds of issues in her life.

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.990 align:middle line:90%
The walk-in occurred.

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:50.810 align:middle line:10%
Her attitude, her perspective--

00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:53.960 align:middle line:10%
I mean, granted, things
changed with lack of memory,

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.090 align:middle line:10%
as you're saying.

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:57.830 align:middle line:10%
Food preferences and that
kind of thing changed.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:05.090 align:middle line:84%
But she became a much more
centered, focused, happy--

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Purposeful probably.

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yes, exactly.

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:10.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's not going to
happen for many people

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:15.250 align:middle line:84%
nor do I want listeners
to be scared that it's

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:16.490 align:middle line:90%
going to happen to them.

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:17.750 align:middle line:90%
There's always guidance.

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:21.380 align:middle line:10%
And so any IP that
comes in as a walk-in

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:25.250 align:middle line:10%
is an IP that has
already had Earth lives.

00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:29.220 align:middle line:84%
So that IP already
has Earth experience.

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:31.440 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
there will be few,

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:36.740 align:middle line:84%
if any, as I'm told-- that there
will be few, if any, ARs coming

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:39.680 align:middle line:84%
in through the walk-in
process because there are way

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:43.147 align:middle line:84%
fewer angelic realm souls that
have been in body on Earth.

00:39:43.147 --> 00:39:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they'll come
through the normal birth

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.350 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>>BACKMAN: They come through
the-- because it's just simply--

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There,
you open your eyes.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:49.800 align:middle line:10%
There's your little angel.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: That's right.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.200 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is
an interesting story.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.390 align:middle line:90%
Someone I knew very well.

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And they were actually
speaking with my soul group.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, you are one
of those very rare beings that

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:04.350 align:middle line:84%
actually is what
they call a walk-in.

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:08.330 align:middle line:10%
And what had happened was, as
the soul hovers and stays close

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:12.170 align:middle line:10%
to the developing fetus in the
body, familiarizing itself,

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:14.960 align:middle line:10%
and putting its imprints
in, at the last minute,

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:21.160 align:middle line:10%
another familial and
familiar soul at birth

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:24.190 align:middle line:10%
muscled him out
and took the body.

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:31.380 align:middle line:84%
That body drowned at
three, but was recovered.

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And this one was able to
then come into the body.

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.800 align:middle line:84%
That one stepped aside
because it was not right.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.150 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't the one that
had constructed all of it.

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:41.320 align:middle line:90%
It was the other one.

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:45.000 align:middle line:84%
So the original person that
was with the developing fetus

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.400 align:middle line:84%
then took the body as it
was supposed to have been.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.790 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of those one- to
three-year-old connections

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:52.350 align:middle line:90%
never happened.

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:54.520 align:middle line:84%
There's a trade-off
for everything here.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that was
a fascinating story.

00:40:56.470 --> 00:41:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Just thinking a soul could
just muscle in at birth, just--

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.500 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Yeah.

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:04.697 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, my sense is
that it's extremely rare.

00:41:04.697 --> 00:41:05.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very rare.

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:07.800 align:middle line:90%
They said this was very rare.

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.010 align:middle line:84%
But I'm always one fascinated
by the rare and unusual

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and how these
things are possible.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:14.940 align:middle line:84%
So at least we
know now that this

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:19.150 align:middle line:84%
will be happening in greater
numbers but not great numbers

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:19.950 align:middle line:90%
by any means.

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:21.340 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Our planet is about
95% Earth-based souls.

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that
will shift dramatically.

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.540 align:middle line:84%
So anything that the families--
we only have a few minutes left.

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:32.340 align:middle line:90%
This flew.

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Anything we need to know as
parents, grandparents, friends,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.830 align:middle line:84%
sisters, brothers when we
start to recognize when

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:44.330 align:middle line:84%
we have a new AR soul or IP soul
here that might be struggling

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:49.520 align:middle line:84%
a bit to help them, to recognize
them, to be of service to them

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:50.320 align:middle line:90%
in any way?

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:54.066 align:middle line:90%


00:41:54.066 --> 00:41:55.970 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: I'll focus
just very briefly

00:41:55.970 --> 00:42:00.410 align:middle line:10%
and answer that both
personally and professionally.

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:03.600 align:middle line:10%
We happen to have a grandson
who actually is an EB.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:05.990 align:middle line:10%
But he has a lot
of IP experience.

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:08.760 align:middle line:10%
And he's about to
graduate from high school.

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:11.160 align:middle line:90%
And he had to be understood.

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:15.930 align:middle line:84%
He had to have extra help
in focusing his learning.

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:18.360 align:middle line:84%
There's not a thing
wrong with him.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:22.440 align:middle line:90%
He's perfectly capable.

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.560 align:middle line:90%
And I said this earlier.

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:25.620 align:middle line:84%
We have to stop putting
people in boxes.

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think we
have to fit a mold.

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.130 align:middle line:90%
We have to look a certain way.

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:32.160 align:middle line:84%
We have to live our
life a certain way

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:35.190 align:middle line:84%
and accept that a lot
of these children that

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:37.600 align:middle line:84%
are going to be showing
up on our planet--

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Helping us to
become the new human.

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: That's right.

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:44.350 align:middle line:10%
And accept their uniqueness,
and look for their gifts.

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:46.650 align:middle line:10%
Don't look where they don't--

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:47.790 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: For dysfunction.

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:48.420 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:48.730 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:51.022 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: But look for what
are their gifts and skills

00:42:51.022 --> 00:42:52.510 align:middle line:10%
because they're
going to have them.

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:53.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have a new
book called Soul Design.

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.610 align:middle line:84%
You have a new
course, Soul design.

00:42:57.610 --> 00:42:59.760 align:middle line:10%
Just give us a
really brief overview

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.750 align:middle line:10%
of what that's about
before we say goodbye.

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:04.110 align:middle line:10%
>>BACKMAN: Well, that was
downloaded to me to help

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:05.740 align:middle line:10%
understand us--

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:07.620 align:middle line:10%
I came up with a
couple of terms.

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:11.310 align:middle line:10%
Soul essence psychology
means look at your life

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:13.510 align:middle line:10%
now but look at who
you are as a soul.

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:16.850 align:middle line:84%
So soul design means,
what are your past lives?

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:19.580 align:middle line:90%
Are you EB, IP, or AR?

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:21.140 align:middle line:90%
What's your life purpose?

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:22.550 align:middle line:90%
What's your archetype?

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Understand who you are as
a soul and why you're here.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And so my book and
this new course

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:34.570 align:middle line:84%
is all about going deep into
the uniqueness of why we're here

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:38.777 align:middle line:84%
and that we're a soul with
important reason to be here.

00:43:38.777 --> 00:43:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Your work is so important
right now, Linda,

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:44.690 align:middle line:84%
because this is a very
confusing time for humanity.

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And we need people to help
us understand who we are.

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:49.390 align:middle line:10%
So thank you so much
for everything you do

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:50.450 align:middle line:10%
and for being here again.

00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:52.550 align:middle line:10%
And I'm sure I'll be seeing
you back before too long.

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:53.425 align:middle line:90%
>>BACKMAN: Thank you.

00:43:53.425 --> 00:43:54.340 align:middle line:90%
My pleasure.

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:56.298 align:middle line:84%
