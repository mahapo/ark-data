>>REGINA MEREDITH: As much
as we try to tell ourselves

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.330 align:middle line:10%
that we as women are liberated
from the chains of servitude

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.530 align:middle line:10%
of the past, we
often remain slaves

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.490 align:middle line:10%
to our own minds and DNA.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.800 align:middle line:84%
You can't take thousands
of years of programming

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.760 align:middle line:84%
of being perceived
as lesser than

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and have that healed in
four to five decades.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.130 align:middle line:90%
But it is beginning to heal.

Cate Montana, author
of "Unearthing Venus,"

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.960 align:middle line:84%
tells her version of the story
of what it is to be a woman.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.160 align:middle line:84%
A very courageous memoir,
Cate shares the fear and hope

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.700 align:middle line:84%
of women everywhere
that the time truly

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.310 align:middle line:84%
comes when we can
be seen for who

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.570 align:middle line:84%
we are among men but
also among ourselves.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.680 align:middle line:90%
Cate, what a book.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.890 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm sure
every woman and-- do

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.870 align:middle line:90%
men read your book, as well?

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CATE MONTANA: I've been really
surprised at how many men.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.090 align:middle line:90%
It's actually about 50-50.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.173 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's fabulous.

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: And a positive,
very enthusiastic response

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.520 align:middle line:90%
from both sexes.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well this is one of
the most vulnerable, revealing

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.120 align:middle line:84%
memoirs on what it is to be a
woman that I have ever read.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it's like you--
this conversation will reveal

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.090 align:middle line:84%
it-- we've been down a
lot of the same roads.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Yeah, we have.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
whole road of feminism

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.170 align:middle line:84%
is not anything that
has ever interested me.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.340 align:middle line:84%
But as you go through
life, you start

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.980 align:middle line:84%
seeing these
essential areas that

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.030 align:middle line:84%
just have to be mended
up, where the wounds are,

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.110 align:middle line:90%
between the sexes.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.422 align:middle line:90%
And it has to be talked about.

00:01:49.422 --> 00:01:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Right.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So first of all,
you start your book out,

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.300 align:middle line:84%
I think, at a very
appropriate place,

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.900 align:middle line:84%
which I'd like you
to share with us,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.560 align:middle line:84%
with one of my favorite
interviewees-- John Perkins.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: John Perkins.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And work
with the Shuar tribe

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and talking about the difference
between men and women.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And if you will, please,
set the stage for us

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.042 align:middle line:84%
and share that and share
why you shared that

00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:11.250 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of the book.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: OK.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.692 align:middle line:10%
And you're right,
the last thing I ever

00:02:15.692 --> 00:02:17.400 align:middle line:10%
thought that I would
ever get involved in

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.790 align:middle line:10%
would be feminist
anything, that I would ever

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.960 align:middle line:10%
write about feminine
oriented anything,

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.516 align:middle line:10%
or even write an article
about the feminine.

00:02:25.516 --> 00:02:26.140 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.598 align:middle line:10%
>>MONTANA: So this book came
as a big surprise for me, too.

00:02:28.598 --> 00:02:30.840 align:middle line:10%
And John Perkins is
totally responsible.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.220 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a article
and interview with him

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.906 align:middle line:84%
for an article for
"Indian Country

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Today," a national
Native American paper.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.530 align:middle line:84%
I've been a newspaper
and magazine

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.430 align:middle line:90%
journalist for about 25 years.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.454 align:middle line:90%
And this was way back in 1999.

00:02:47.454 --> 00:02:49.870 align:middle line:84%
So we're in the middle of this
conversation and interview,

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.750 align:middle line:84%
and he starts talking
about the Shuar tribe

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.680 align:middle line:84%
down in the Brazilian rainforest
and their gender differences

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.730 align:middle line:84%
and how they've segmented their
society along gender lines.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.390 align:middle line:90%
The men do guy things.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.290 align:middle line:84%
They hunt and they
fish and they cut down

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.420 align:middle line:90%
trees for the huts and canoes.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And the women do
domestic chores,

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.760 align:middle line:84%
take care of the children,
gather wild edibles.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.680 align:middle line:90%
Nothing new there.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Both men and women are equally
represented on tribal council.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.770 align:middle line:90%
That was-- OK.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So there wasn't
any-- and there was

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.760 align:middle line:90%
no battle of the sexes going on.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.090 align:middle line:84%
It was very clear when he talked
about their gender dynamics

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.440 align:middle line:84%
that men and women
understood themselves

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.270 align:middle line:84%
in a larger context
than just he and she,

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.390 align:middle line:84%
that they were actually
getting into a lot

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.359 align:middle line:84%
of qualitative aspects of
being a man, being a woman.

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:41.900 align:middle line:84%
They played to each
other's strengths

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.490 align:middle line:90%
rather than their weaknesses.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And he said that there
was one job, however,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.520 align:middle line:84%
in this tribe that only
the women could do.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And that the survival of the
tribe depended upon the women

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.110 align:middle line:90%
doing this one job.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.443 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the first
thing that went off in my mind

00:03:56.443 --> 00:03:58.865 align:middle line:90%
was right, have babies, biology.

00:03:58.865 --> 00:03:59.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cook.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Cook, yeah.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no,
that's not it at all.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.530 align:middle line:84%
He said the Shuar
tribe understands

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.570 align:middle line:84%
the masculine nature
tends towards being goal

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.510 align:middle line:84%
oriented, directed,
aggressive, competitive, pedal

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.089 align:middle line:90%
to the metal.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.005 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Destructive.

00:04:17.005 --> 00:04:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: As a result, pedal
to the metal, no stop button.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:21.649 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: They
understood woman's nature

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.950 align:middle line:84%
is much more intuitive, much
more community oriented, much

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.360 align:middle line:84%
more grounded in
relationship, whether it

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.620 align:middle line:84%
was the needs of the tribe or
the needs of their relationship

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.360 align:middle line:90%
with the earth.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.520 align:middle line:84%
So the men absolutely depended
upon the women telling them

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.290 align:middle line:90%
when to stop.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
was what I liked.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.255 align:middle line:84%
He said the men will fish
until there are no more fish.

00:04:47.255 --> 00:04:47.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Yep.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They will
kill the animals

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.990 align:middle line:84%
until there are no more
animals and on and on.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to the women
to tell us when to stop.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And didn't he say then,
why aren't your women

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.817 align:middle line:90%
telling you to stop?

00:04:59.817 --> 00:05:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: Well, the
first part of the story

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.060 align:middle line:90%
rocked my world, Regina.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And then he followed
it up with that.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.210 align:middle line:84%
He asked me, he
said-- and this is

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.970 align:middle line:84%
what he was asked by this
shaman in the tribe--

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.430 align:middle line:84%
where are your
Western women today?

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Why are you not telling
your men to stop?

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.640 align:middle line:84%
You are taking the world over
a cliff, depleting resources.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.240 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.850 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:23.370 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.495 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh, I don't know.

00:05:24.495 --> 00:05:27.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm out there busy making
a buck, making a living,

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.390 align:middle line:84%
being just as aggressive,
having not a clue where the stop

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.610 align:middle line:84%
button is probably
more than any man.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Because I have more
to prove because I

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.550 align:middle line:84%
came on deck in the '60s
and '70s as a woman.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.537 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we're--

00:05:40.537 --> 00:05:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: We'll get into that.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to get into that.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Yeah.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.985 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:45.390 align:middle line:90%
And so that's true.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes the women possess
more of the masculine traits

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.650 align:middle line:84%
when you feel as
though you've had

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.272 align:middle line:84%
to fight for your
place in the world.

00:05:51.272 --> 00:05:51.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Right.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so this isn't--
doesn't have to do with body

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.392 align:middle line:90%
parts, as we said off camera.

00:05:57.392 --> 00:05:58.100 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Right.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These
are deeper traits.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: That conversation
changed my entire life.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.580 align:middle line:84%
I wrote the article and I was
still reeling weeks later,

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.650 align:middle line:84%
contemplating the power
that the Shuar women had

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.350 align:middle line:84%
to be able to tell the men to
do anything, let alone stop.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine the women when
everybody is coming across

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.840 align:middle line:84%
in the wagon trains and
the railroads to the West

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.620 align:middle line:84%
and they're out
blitzkrieging the buffalo

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.642 align:middle line:84%
by the hundreds of thousands
and just laying waste to them.

00:06:25.642 --> 00:06:27.974 align:middle line:84%
And women saying, I don't
think you should do that.

00:06:27.974 --> 00:06:29.265 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right, exactly.

00:06:29.265 --> 00:06:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: Because we had
no real validity as women.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
until-- You know, I

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.190 align:middle line:90%
thought about it more and more.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh my god, it's not
until I become something other

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle line:84%
than a woman that I have
credibility and validity.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.290 align:middle line:84%
I have to be a TV editor,
or a newspaper reporter,

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.830 align:middle line:84%
or a teacher, or
something like that.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.210 align:middle line:90%
Then I have credibility.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:49.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:50.810 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.880 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now let's go
and do the back story,

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.830 align:middle line:84%
because you were raised in late
'50s, early '60s, a little girl

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.070 align:middle line:84%
in America with a mother
who played the classic role,

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:09.260 align:middle line:84%
and a stepfather who played a
maybe less than classic role,

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.910 align:middle line:84%
but certainly not a very
positive one in your life.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.897 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back
to the beginning.

00:07:15.897 --> 00:07:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: Yeah, and I used to
think that "Father Knows Best,"

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.310 align:middle line:84%
because that was the kind
of television programming

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.760 align:middle line:90%
I was raised with.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.910 align:middle line:84%
I looked at my family
dynamics, which were sorely

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.260 align:middle line:84%
dysfunctional in comparison
to "Father Knows Best,"

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.140 align:middle line:84%
and I wondered,
well, what's wrong?

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.580 align:middle line:84%
What's wrong with me that I
didn't get that kind of family.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.400 align:middle line:84%
My mom was a tomboy
who learned not

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.770 align:middle line:84%
to be a tomboy, who learned
to be more submissive,

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.930 align:middle line:84%
be polite, never say anything
against what a man would say,

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.552 align:middle line:84%
and she suppressed
all of her joie de

00:07:53.552 --> 00:07:56.540 align:middle line:84%
vivre to mold herself
in a direction

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.860 align:middle line:84%
that her society and that
her family had indicated

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.830 align:middle line:90%
was the way to go.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And she tried her
best to get me to go

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.840 align:middle line:84%
in that direction, all the
while kind of under the table

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.510 align:middle line:84%
not wanting me to subdue my
own tomboy tendencies at all.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was a fine line
for her to walk in raising you.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:16.051 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: It really was.

00:08:16.051 --> 00:08:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And because your
stepfather was an angry man.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: He was an
angry, wounded man,

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and it's easy to say he did
the best he could considering.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:25.986 align:middle line:90%
But he was--

00:08:25.986 --> 00:08:27.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He did a bad job.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: He did a
very, very bad job.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:33.159 align:middle line:84%
And very violent, abusive,
fortunately not physically

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:36.390 align:middle line:84%
and sexually, but of course
then the emotional abuse,

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.320 align:middle line:84%
and the verbal abuse is actually
sometimes even more subtle.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.280 align:middle line:84%
At least if you've had
your head knocked off,

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.690 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like
therapeutic and purgative.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.020 align:middle line:90%
It's just like, oh, OK.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.090 align:middle line:84%
But the rest is just
more subtly undermining.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.742 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The death by 1,000
cuts, I think it's called.

00:08:51.742 --> 00:08:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: There you go.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so your
mother was essentially

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.100 align:middle line:84%
the walking wounded for
a big part of her life.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: And the
peacemaker no matter what,

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.490 align:middle line:84%
because my step dad and I
would just go toe to toe.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.500 align:middle line:84%
So she would always
intervene, and smooth, put oil

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.270 align:middle line:90%
on the waters.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And so she played a very
classic feminine role.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But she also played
a role that was beyond not

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.260 align:middle line:84%
supportive of you at a time when
you experienced a molestation

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.612 align:middle line:90%
by the neighborhood paperboy.

00:09:23.612 --> 00:09:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Right.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.285 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
learned maybe, it

00:09:27.285 --> 00:09:29.460 align:middle line:84%
was about 15 years
ago, maybe 20 years

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.130 align:middle line:84%
ago now, it was a time in
life where my girlfriends were

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.130 align:middle line:84%
starting to tell me these
various revelations,

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.910 align:middle line:84%
successful women, even my
mother, even within the family,

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.610 align:middle line:90%
about all of the molestations.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.690 align:middle line:84%
I was absolutely shocked
at how many of the women

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:49.410 align:middle line:84%
I knew had been through a rape
or molestation by someone close

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.350 align:middle line:90%
to them, and even in the family.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:52.520 align:middle line:90%
And good families.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, it would seem
like good families.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.352 align:middle line:90%
Nice people.

00:09:55.352 --> 00:09:56.560 align:middle line:90%
They go to church on Sundays.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.024 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is no one
ever stood up for them,

00:10:00.024 --> 00:10:01.690 align:middle line:84%
and your mother didn't
stand up for you.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.523 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: My mother
didn't stand up for me.

00:10:03.523 --> 00:10:06.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anybody ever
stood up for my mother.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.220 align:middle line:84%
Looking back, the
neighborhood dynamics,

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:14.220 align:middle line:84%
which writing the book was
this recapitulation of having

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.570 align:middle line:84%
to try to understand all
these gender dynamics,

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:20.140 align:middle line:84%
and how did I come out the
other end in my 40s and 50s

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.680 align:middle line:84%
with my foot nailed to the
pedal trying to prove myself so

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.550 align:middle line:84%
voraciously in this
world, so desperately

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:28.970 align:middle line:90%
insecure underneath all of that.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.340 align:middle line:84%
So looking back, and looking
at the neighborhood dynamics,

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Regina, I mean, one
neighbor's husband

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.180 align:middle line:84%
drank, and would
lock his little kids

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.560 align:middle line:84%
naked outside in the yard,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.720 align:middle line:90%
It was really epidemic.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.410 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know whoever came
up with "Father Knows Best,"

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and "Leave it to
Beaver," but-- Hollywood.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:47.380 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.050 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, there's another
aspect, and talking about you,

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.560 align:middle line:84%
and talking about
carrying forward,

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.500 align:middle line:84%
as I said when I
was introducing you,

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:04.020 align:middle line:84%
we can have the institution
of various and forced rights

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:08.390 align:middle line:84%
for women and other
minorities, however,

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:12.840 align:middle line:84%
that DNA patterning on a
solo level is very real,

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.362 align:middle line:84%
and you actually had
memories of past lives.

00:11:15.362 --> 00:11:16.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: I did.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As you were a child.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.499 align:middle line:84%
And I thought one
of them was really

00:11:18.499 --> 00:11:20.620 align:middle line:84%
freaky about what
happened to this woman.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Share what you were
remembering from another time.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: I had early abuse
dreams, visions, memories.

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.380 align:middle line:84%
At age four how
could you possibly

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.810 align:middle line:84%
determine what
these things were.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.860 align:middle line:84%
I had visions of
burning, being burned,

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.350 align:middle line:84%
being locked in dark
places, dungeons.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I also had a vision
of being pregnant

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.060 align:middle line:84%
and sold on a
slave block in what

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.820 align:middle line:90%
appeared to be Roman times.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.640 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't pass muster.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And a Roman soldier came
up and slit my belly open

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.550 align:middle line:90%
with the sword.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:90%
And I died.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And like what four
year old-- in 1955,

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.010 align:middle line:84%
where would I have gotten
that kind of imagery?

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:18.930 align:middle line:84%
So it colored my subconscious
emotional security,

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:23.250 align:middle line:84%
or lack thereof, to a degree
that I had no idea of.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And it ended up coloring
my sexual life that there

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:34.090 align:middle line:84%
was such a mixture in
my subconscious from God

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:37.574 align:middle line:84%
only knows where, and
what lifetimes in my DNA.

00:12:37.574 --> 00:12:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
that's in all of us.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:40.282 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: That's in all of us.

00:12:40.282 --> 00:12:41.781 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, these
are the things.

00:12:41.781 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:90%
You don't ever talk about this.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.240 align:middle line:84%
I was in my 30s before I started
talking about these things,

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:50.300 align:middle line:84%
because I had a convoluted
understanding of pain

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and pleasure around
sexuality because

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.490 align:middle line:84%
of these early memories,
whatever they were.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until I
started talking about it,

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.030 align:middle line:84%
and then I would talk
about to my girlfriends

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.724 align:middle line:84%
well into a couple
of bottles of wine,

00:13:04.724 --> 00:13:07.140 align:middle line:84%
it's just like, well, have you
ever fantasized when you're

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.630 align:middle line:84%
having sex with your
husband about being raped,

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:13.410 align:middle line:84%
and they'd go, [GASP], you know,
and everything would kind of

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:16.470 align:middle line:84%
like stop, and then they'd
go, oh my God, yes I have.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.820 align:middle line:90%
Popular genres of books.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:18.320 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.010 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the "Shades Of Gray."

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's in this, but
it's not talked about,

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.680 align:middle line:90%
because it's horrific.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.499 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But these are
almost cellular memories--

00:13:29.499 --> 00:13:30.415 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Absolutely.

00:13:30.415 --> 00:13:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From ancient times.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:32.950 align:middle line:90%
And not so ancient times.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.200 align:middle line:84%
These are cellular
memories carried forward.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: This is still
going on in the Middle East.

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.171 align:middle line:84%
So I thought it was
fascinating, because you

00:13:41.171 --> 00:13:42.170 align:middle line:90%
were such a little girl.

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:44.550 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't have had a
context for any of that.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Certainly not.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:46.861 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now we go
back to your mother.

00:13:46.861 --> 00:13:49.060 align:middle line:84%
So your mother suppressed
all of this in herself,

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:50.070 align:middle line:90%
yet she was a tomboy.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.022 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
the time when you got,

00:13:52.022 --> 00:13:53.230 align:middle line:90%
I think it was a bee bee gun.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.380 align:middle line:84%
I love this back story of
that, how that happened,

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and how your mother showed
herself to the world.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.500 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:13:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Yeah.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Here's how I learned
about my mom.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.400 align:middle line:84%
It was going on to
my eighth Christmas,

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.950 align:middle line:84%
and my parents would
disappear to the basement

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:10.485 align:middle line:84%
night after night
after dinner as we

00:14:10.485 --> 00:14:11.610 align:middle line:90%
were approaching Christmas.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was sworn never
to come downstairs.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And as it turns out I was given
a pellet gun, and a Barbie

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.850 align:middle line:90%
doll.

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just to make
sure you didn't go wrong.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Exactly.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.580 align:middle line:84%
But my mom and dad had been down
in the basement citing it in.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.320 align:middle line:90%
It was a bona fide gun.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.560 align:middle line:84%
It could shoot halfway through
the Washington DC telephone

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.150 align:middle line:90%
book.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I remember
my mom way later

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.710 align:middle line:84%
in life telling me this
story of, she and Nan Poppet

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.730 align:middle line:84%
had way too much
bourbon one night,

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:43.200 align:middle line:84%
and they're down in the basement
shooting the pellet gun,

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.670 align:middle line:90%
and having a good time.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And she was a crack
shot as it turned out.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And she just
shocked my step dad.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And he dared her in kind
of a drunken, whatever

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.490 align:middle line:84%
moment that she didn't have the
guts to shoot the cigarette out

00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.970 align:middle line:90%
of his mouth.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And she just took
aim, and just, pew,

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.900 align:middle line:84%
and there was the tip of the
cigarette on the basement

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.382 align:middle line:90%
floor.

00:15:06.382 --> 00:15:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
when you found out

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.730 align:middle line:84%
she was head of the sharp
shooting team right?

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:10.470 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: Then I
found out she was

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:12.520 align:middle line:84%
head of the sharp
shooting club in college.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She never
talked about it.

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.207 align:middle line:90%
She was June Cleaver.

00:15:15.207 --> 00:15:16.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: She was June Cleaver.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.040 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.379 align:middle line:84%
June Cleaver didn't
do that sort of stuff.

00:15:19.379 --> 00:15:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so for you, a
lot of your power, and this

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.960 align:middle line:84%
is another very typical, maybe
looking into the subconscious

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.590 align:middle line:84%
reasons for this as well,
or the deep memory of it,

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:31.200 align:middle line:84%
you were very drawn to the world
of horses, animals and nature

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.830 align:middle line:90%
in general, but horses.

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And you even used to ride
with Caroline Kennedy

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:36.584 align:middle line:90%
when you were young.

00:15:36.584 --> 00:15:37.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Yeah.

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about that
world, what it brought to you.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.922 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit
about what Carolyn

00:15:42.922 --> 00:15:44.380 align:middle line:84%
was like, because
she's so private.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.630 align:middle line:84%
We never get to hear anything
about what she was like.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: Oh, I
didn't really know her.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.544 align:middle line:84%
Those of us in the
pony club, we were

00:15:51.544 --> 00:15:53.460 align:middle line:84%
supposed to stay at the
back of the hunt field

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.950 align:middle line:84%
and take care of
the-- And Caroline

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:57.550 align:middle line:90%
was-- gosh how old was she?

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:02.070 align:middle line:84%
About seven at that time,
and I was nine or ten.

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And so we were like
stuck with Carolyn.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.379 align:middle line:90%
So that was that.

00:16:07.379 --> 00:16:09.045 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, you're
stuck with Carolyn,

00:16:09.045 --> 00:16:11.280 align:middle line:84%
but the thing is you were
living in, by this time,

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.740 align:middle line:84%
in nature with nature really
into horses, competition,

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.579 align:middle line:90%
in a very elite lifestyle.

00:16:16.579 --> 00:16:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: In a very
elite lifestyle.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.453 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:16:19.453 --> 00:16:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: It was really
as totally as dysfunctional

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.755 align:middle line:84%
as Washington DC
suburbia had been.

00:16:25.755 --> 00:16:30.950 align:middle line:84%
The vices were just more
expensive and more accessive,

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:35.289 align:middle line:84%
and were looked upon as
something that everybody did,

00:16:35.289 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle line:84%
and it was almost like, well,
how much you could drink,

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:42.405 align:middle line:84%
and how dysfunctional you could
be was almost a mark of pride.

00:16:42.405 --> 00:16:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To go
to your therapist

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.340 align:middle line:90%
to do messed up things.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Et cetera, et cetera.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:50.012 align:middle line:84%
It was very odd, but mostly
living in the country

00:16:50.012 --> 00:16:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and being raised
on a farm, Regina,

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:55.070 align:middle line:84%
was my first taste of
genuine, soul level freedom.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:17:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And it got me out of the
church orientation about what

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:05.500 align:middle line:84%
God is or isn't, and
me as a soul or not,

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.270 align:middle line:84%
whatever, and
introduced me to life.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:12.589 align:middle line:84%
And such a raging
life force that was

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:15.770 align:middle line:90%
unbridled and uncontrollable.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And living in the '50s
and '60s, and even

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:22.369 align:middle line:84%
still, life, we live in a
very masculinized society,

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:28.840 align:middle line:84%
and control is one of the Daoist
Yang systematic, rule bound,

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:33.000 align:middle line:84%
law bound control is one
of the Yang tendencies.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And so, God, being raised on a
farm, getting out on my pony,

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and having no responsibility
except going wherever

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.630 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go for
hours, half a day, a day,

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:46.780 align:middle line:84%
and just be gone in
nature changed my life.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:51.060 align:middle line:84%
It really opened me up to
my own soul, and my heart,

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and I looked at that, and I
would ask the Sunday school

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:57.782 align:middle line:84%
teacher and the Reverend
questions like-- Well, then I

00:17:57.782 --> 00:18:00.240 align:middle line:84%
ended up in a Catholic convent
school in high school, which

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:00.948 align:middle line:90%
is another story.

00:18:00.948 --> 00:18:04.620 align:middle line:84%
But, you know,
did I live before,

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.950 align:middle line:84%
because I've got all
these old memories.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:11.660 align:middle line:84%
I've got stuff inside me that
says I've been here before.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And so I would ask, and
they would go, oh, well, no.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.360 align:middle line:84%
You only go around once
in life, so you better

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.820 align:middle line:90%
be good little girl.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.170 align:middle line:90%
And nature told me otherwise.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.715 align:middle line:84%
I looked at the cycles of the
seasons, and a calf would die,

00:18:25.715 --> 00:18:28.880 align:middle line:84%
and a calf would be born,
and a foal would come.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And there was a rhythm,
and a naturalness,

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:37.980 align:middle line:84%
and an uncontrollable
expansion to nature.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And now, looking
back, I realized

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:45.140 align:middle line:84%
that I had many, many peak
experiences and somadee

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.225 align:middle line:90%
moments when I was growing up.

00:18:47.225 --> 00:18:50.540 align:middle line:84%
I Was just tuned in,
and once I was set free

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.380 align:middle line:90%
it was just like, whew.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:52.890 align:middle line:90%
I just--

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.909 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what's the
thing with girls and horses?

00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:56.700 align:middle line:90%
What is this thing?

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I couldn't have a horse.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.500 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have that
kind of land or money.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.639 align:middle line:90%
I always wanted a horse.

00:19:02.639 --> 00:19:03.930 align:middle line:90%
So I'd read books about horses.

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:04.638 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Right.

00:19:04.638 --> 00:19:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
such a deep love.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.290 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: I wish
I knew for sure.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.830 align:middle line:84%
I know that the horse is
seen as a power animal.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:16.240 align:middle line:84%
In the medicine cards, horse
is about power and strength.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think, perhaps if I
wanted to get all psychological,

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.230 align:middle line:84%
it's because we had so little
power that we were attracted

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:30.590 align:middle line:84%
to these amazingly beautiful,
graceful animals that-- Well,

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.350 align:middle line:84%
horsepower that
powered everything.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: From the grist
mills to your transportation.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.530 align:middle line:84%
Everything depended
on horsepower.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And for the gender
that had no power,

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:46.740 align:middle line:84%
I think it's kind of natural
that we went in that direction.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's very
normal for young girls,

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.790 align:middle line:90%
pubescent girls.

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:52.430 align:middle line:90%
It's an old, old tale.

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And so let's move into
the pubescent years.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.890 align:middle line:84%
Your sex education
from your mother.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:00.476 align:middle line:90%
What was it, one sentence?

00:20:00.476 --> 00:20:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: Go out
and look at the cows.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.940 align:middle line:90%
Go out and watch the cows.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:08.210 align:middle line:84%
That was my sex education
101, which, of course,

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.951 align:middle line:84%
I went out and watched
the cows, and the heifers

00:20:10.951 --> 00:20:13.200 align:middle line:84%
humped the heifers, and the
steers humped the heifers,

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.900 align:middle line:84%
and the steers
humped the steers.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And every once and--
the bull and the cows

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.470 align:middle line:84%
actually did very
precious little.

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.860 align:middle line:90%
And I was like really?

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:23.430 align:middle line:84%
So, as I wrote in the book,
the missionary position

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.885 align:middle line:84%
came as a shock when
I discovered it.

00:20:25.885 --> 00:20:28.800 align:middle line:90%


00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.769 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, your mother
obviously was a modest woman.

00:20:31.769 --> 00:20:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: She was
incredibly modest.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And nor did many
of the women of that era

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.170 align:middle line:90%
have any answers.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my mother shoved
a little five page

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:40.257 align:middle line:90%
book in my hand.

00:20:40.257 --> 00:20:42.173 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what they
did, and walked away.

00:20:42.173 --> 00:20:43.735 align:middle line:84%
And you just learned
to deal with it.

00:20:43.735 --> 00:20:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And you'll figure out
the rest on your own.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.530 align:middle line:84%
But you did have
over a long period

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:50.760 align:middle line:84%
of time, kind of a
blossoming of yourself

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:55.260 align:middle line:84%
with a young man that worked
there with you with the horses.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.499 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Oh yeah.

00:20:56.499 --> 00:20:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you did kind of
learn through all of that.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:20:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Don't we all.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Haven't we for
thousands of years

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:02.245 align:middle line:90%
just do what comes naturally.

00:21:02.245 --> 00:21:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:05.790 align:middle line:84%
So you had the boy there
who worked alongside you,

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:07.400 align:middle line:84%
which we can get
to in a little bit.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.440 align:middle line:84%
So after you got "the curse,"
and you went on through school,

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.940 align:middle line:84%
and you learned
how to be charming.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: And what
a thing to call it.

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "The curse."

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: What a
thing to call it.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know, your
mother called it the curse.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.740 align:middle line:90%
And so did all of them.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So you go through, and now
you're in this wealthy area,

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.290 align:middle line:84%
and you're in this very
wealthy social scene, which

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:25.200 align:middle line:90%
is very dysfunctional.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.450 align:middle line:84%
But you found that
you had power.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:28.320 align:middle line:90%
You could flirt.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.010 align:middle line:84%
You could start using the
feminine wiles with men,

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:33.850 align:middle line:90%
with young boys.

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And what was that like for you
at that point in your life,

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:41.780 align:middle line:84%
after having observed the
natural world around you?

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: It seemed natural and
unnatural all at the same time.

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:48.920 align:middle line:84%
It came just like,
whew, out of nowhere.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:52.335 align:middle line:84%
I had no sex education, as you
pointed out, like any of us.

00:21:52.335 --> 00:21:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nobody did, yeah.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: And so it became a
matter of just like something

00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:00.690 align:middle line:90%
that you just do it.

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And I know the attitude hasn't
changed 40, 30 years later.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:10.205 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: It was
something to do.

00:22:10.205 --> 00:22:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you were
proving yourself, too.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: And I
was proving myself.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.258 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You had power
as a feminine creature.

00:22:15.258 --> 00:22:16.781 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Yes.

00:22:16.781 --> 00:22:17.280 align:middle line:90%
I suppose.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.200 align:middle line:84%
It was totally
unconscious, Regina.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.110 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think about
any of this stuff.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:24.522 align:middle line:84%
I just went where my
hormones drove me.

00:22:24.522 --> 00:22:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But you are driven.

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:26.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:28.925 align:middle line:84%
So let's get on down
the road now to college,

00:22:28.925 --> 00:22:30.060 align:middle line:90%
and let's get beyond that.

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's get to when you
started in your career, which

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.760 align:middle line:84%
this is where our lives
started paralleling.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:40.000 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about a
time when women were not

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.820 align:middle line:84%
in the world of
sports television.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.450 align:middle line:84%
I was in front of the
camera, my little makeup

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:46.220 align:middle line:84%
artist and blue
eyeshadow talking

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:48.400 align:middle line:84%
all about the game
coming up, and you

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.170 align:middle line:90%
were in the truck with the guys.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: I was, as a tape
editor, and did slow motion

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:53.090 align:middle line:90%
replays.

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:55.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you were the
first at a network level?

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: As far as
I'm aware, absolutely.

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.720 align:middle line:84%
The National Association
of Broadcast Engineers

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.810 align:middle line:84%
and Technicians went
on strike in 1977.

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:06.850 align:middle line:84%
I was called out of
the blue, because I'd

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.660 align:middle line:84%
been working in television
as a director at that point.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.670 align:middle line:84%
I got a call out of the
blue from some guy in LA

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.420 align:middle line:84%
who was looking to
hire scabs, basically,

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.860 align:middle line:84%
when NABET went
on strike, and did

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:24.610 align:middle line:84%
I want to run tape at the
1977 Monday Night Football

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:26.420 align:middle line:90%
opening in Saint Louis.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:31.996 align:middle line:84%
And so I said yes, and that was
an answer that changed my life.

00:23:31.996 --> 00:23:36.805 align:middle line:84%
I crossed the picket lines,
hundreds of middle aged men,

00:23:36.805 --> 00:23:38.340 align:middle line:90%
and got to the trucks.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.734 align:middle line:84%
And 45 other middle
aged men, you

00:23:41.734 --> 00:23:44.150 align:middle line:84%
know, looking like obviously
they know what they're doing,

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.340 align:middle line:90%
and there was me.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.855 align:middle line:90%
And it was terrifying.

00:23:48.855 --> 00:23:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I can imagine.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:54.022 align:middle line:84%
It was terrifying being on
my end, and as a token female

00:23:54.022 --> 00:23:54.980 align:middle line:90%
in the world of sports.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.540 align:middle line:84%
But there were only three of
us in front of the camera.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.950 align:middle line:84%
You were in a room
full of these men.

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:01.140 align:middle line:90%
And you were in it.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.642 align:middle line:84%
It's a very different world,
a more raw world you were in.

00:24:04.642 --> 00:24:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: It was
a very raw world,

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:07.780 align:middle line:84%
and I learned to
curse like a sailor,

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.887 align:middle line:84%
and got the hide
of a rhinoceros,

00:24:09.887 --> 00:24:12.220 align:middle line:84%
because if you've ever worked
with any of the ABC sports

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:15.250 align:middle line:84%
directors you have to have
the hide of a rhinoceros.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:18.750 align:middle line:84%
But, you know,
actually it was so up

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:22.150 align:middle line:84%
my alley, because looking
back there was never

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:24.380 align:middle line:84%
a time in my life
that I didn't want

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.880 align:middle line:84%
to prove myself
as good as a man.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.450 align:middle line:84%
It was a-- not even
a subconscious drive.

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:32.910 align:middle line:84%
I was very aware that
I wanted to go out

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:36.680 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to be anything
but like my mother.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.930 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to prove
myself as good as a guy.

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:40.200 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to make money.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:46.025 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to do it in
however I could most stand out.

00:24:46.025 --> 00:24:48.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, I wasn't
going to be a teacher.

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:52.050 align:middle line:84%
I was going to end up being a
TV engineer for God's sakes.

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.567 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: And I did
really, really well at it.

00:24:55.567 --> 00:24:58.025 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but when the
time came you had a boyfriend.

00:24:58.025 --> 00:24:59.750 align:middle line:90%
He was in the industry.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And when it was time to
choose one or the other of you

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.050 align:middle line:90%
for a promotion, it wasn't you.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: That's right.

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:09.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I get that.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:12.050 align:middle line:84%
So you were the more
qualified of the two,

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:15.090 align:middle line:84%
but of course at this time,
that's not going to happen.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:17.740 align:middle line:84%
But speak about what happened
when you were passed over,

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.740 align:middle line:84%
the reason you were given
for being passed over.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: Oh, this was at
the beginning of my television

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:22.320 align:middle line:90%
career.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.100 align:middle line:84%
I was working as
a tape operator.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.930 align:middle line:84%
I got my boyfriend in
the door about six months

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:30.350 align:middle line:84%
to eight months after
I got hired at WIS TV.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And then I was-- a switching
position came open.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:35.580 align:middle line:90%
I had been training.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:36.980 align:middle line:90%
I was qualified.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And my-- the Production
Manager took me aside

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and said we've got a
position coming open.

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:46.740 align:middle line:84%
I know that you're
better qualified,

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.289 align:middle line:90%
but I'm giving it to--

00:25:48.289 --> 00:25:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your boyfriend.

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:50.413 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Your boyfriend.

00:25:50.413 --> 00:25:53.570 align:middle line:84%
So he says, because
I know how it is.

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:56.990 align:middle line:84%
You guys live together, and
it's really hard for men

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:59.840 align:middle line:90%
to have women surpass them.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And so it's going to be
easier for your relationship

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:04.560 align:middle line:90%
if I promote him first.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And, oh, but thank you for
making that decision for me.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And I had found that
keeping my lips zipped,

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:15.060 align:middle line:84%
and not making waves,
and certainly not going

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:17.140 align:middle line:84%
into emotional
territory had been

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.395 align:middle line:84%
the best way for me
to survive in TV.

00:26:19.395 --> 00:26:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: And so I wasn't
going to jump up and down

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.860 align:middle line:84%
and go, feminism, let
me call my lawyer.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.490 align:middle line:90%
I just went zip.

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I got the
next promotion,

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.557 align:middle line:90%
and then, and then, and then.

00:26:33.557 --> 00:26:34.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I had a very similar--

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: But it was--

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's hard.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:36.980 align:middle line:90%
It is horrifying.

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:39.440 align:middle line:84%
I had a similar
situation as a co-anchor

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.940 align:middle line:90%
in a newscast, nightly newscast.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was called in by
the owner of the station

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:48.030 align:middle line:84%
to say, could you take
over all the ad-libbing,

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.580 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't have
a natural ability.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Anything that wasn't scripted
was disastrous at that time.

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:54.237 align:middle line:90%
It was bad.

00:26:54.237 --> 00:26:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And so they said, would
you please take over

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.889 align:middle line:90%
the control of it.

00:26:56.889 --> 00:26:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
this is kind of weird.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that doesn't look
very good for the show.

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:03.660 align:middle line:84%
But they said, no, we
need you to do this.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'd have to kind of jump in,
and take over all the ad-libs,

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.520 align:middle line:84%
and keep the pace of the
show going, and everything.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.240 align:middle line:84%
So, as it was time to
renew contracts they said,

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.160 align:middle line:84%
oh, we've just had
a budget cut, and we

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.490 align:middle line:84%
can't have a female
as our sole anchor.

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:19.030 align:middle line:90%
And they kept him and dumped me.

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:21.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these things happened
repeatedly those days

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.070 align:middle line:90%
in television.

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.260 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way it was.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.360 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not litigious.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.270 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going to
go jump up and down.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:28.070 align:middle line:90%
Keep it zipped.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:29.330 align:middle line:90%
Move on down the road.

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:31.170 align:middle line:90%
That's what you do.

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And that programming
in and of itself, that

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.509 align:middle line:90%
still lives inside.

00:27:37.509 --> 00:27:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: It does.

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.360 align:middle line:10%
And what's fascinating
to me is that I

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:45.740 align:middle line:10%
never, until fast forward,
ah geez, 25 years?

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.600 align:middle line:10%
I never really even
thought about it.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.060 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it was painful.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:49.561 align:middle line:90%
I moved on.

00:27:49.561 --> 00:27:51.018 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's what you do.

00:27:51.018 --> 00:27:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: But if anybody
ever asked me, were you ever

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:57.940 align:middle line:84%
discriminated against, I'd go,
oh, no, I was one the guys.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:04.660 align:middle line:84%
I just kind of like glossed
over this incredibly deep chasm

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.630 align:middle line:84%
between the masculine
and the feminine,

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:08.700 align:middle line:84%
how I was supposed
to be, how I had

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:13.890 align:middle line:84%
to be to pony up and compete,
and still it was never enough,

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:18.260 align:middle line:84%
how there was this pervasive
sense that I was still

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:21.310 align:middle line:84%
not enough, not good
enough, second class.

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
probably too painful

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:27.462 align:middle line:84%
for me to even
make it conscious.

00:28:27.462 --> 00:28:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it just lives
in the subconscious then.

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:30.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: It lives
in the subconscious.

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:32.271 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
I wrote this book

00:28:32.271 --> 00:28:35.320 align:middle line:84%
that I started-- I assiduously
went back through my life

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.730 align:middle line:84%
to look at, well, what were
the things that happened

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:40.810 align:middle line:84%
in my life that showed this
male, female dichotomy,

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:42.810 align:middle line:84%
and what we're moving
out of, thank god

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:45.870 align:middle line:84%
at long last, in our society,
because if we don't learn

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:50.610 align:middle line:84%
how to bridge out of the
whole masculine orientation,

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:54.517 align:middle line:84%
then we're kind of cooked
as a species I do believe.

00:28:54.517 --> 00:28:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.912 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I want to go
back to something

00:28:57.912 --> 00:28:59.120 align:middle line:90%
we didn't talk about earlier.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Along the way in the
book what you talk about

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:04.310 align:middle line:84%
after your mother gave
you your sex education,

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:06.540 align:middle line:84%
go out and watch
the cows, you start

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.245 align:middle line:84%
reflecting on a story
of the Dugara tribe.

00:29:09.245 --> 00:29:09.870 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Yes.

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:12.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about that for a moment.

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not that way
everywhere in the world.

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:17.200 align:middle line:84%
The indigenous cultures
have a much more holistic

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.650 align:middle line:84%
and beautiful way
of bringing people

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:21.610 align:middle line:84%
into their coming
of age experiences,

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:24.264 align:middle line:84%
and preparing them for sexual
union in marriage later.

00:29:24.264 --> 00:29:25.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Absolutely.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.846 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Please,
let's talk about them.

00:29:26.846 --> 00:29:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: And
what you just said

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:32.615 align:middle line:84%
is a society, a culture,
that is much more aware

00:29:32.615 --> 00:29:36.290 align:middle line:84%
and balanced as far as
the archetypal qualities

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:38.240 align:middle line:90%
of the masculine and feminine.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:42.495 align:middle line:84%
There is in sex, the physical
act itself, which is a doing,

00:29:42.495 --> 00:29:49.150 align:middle line:84%
and there is a receptive,
receiving, passive, being part

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:55.097 align:middle line:84%
of sexuality that opens the
door to psychic gateways.

00:29:55.097 --> 00:29:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.810 align:middle line:90%
A spiritual experience.

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: So that it becomes,
instead of just doing it,

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.384 align:middle line:84%
it becomes a sacred
journey together.

00:30:03.384 --> 00:30:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're
taught that early.

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:06.758 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: And they're
taught that early.

00:30:06.758 --> 00:30:09.440 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't until
I was in my 30s,

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.510 align:middle line:84%
and I was reading some
anthropology texts

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:17.090 align:middle line:84%
about different sexual
cultures and how

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:18.550 align:middle line:90%
men and women were trained.

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And there was this a
whole understanding

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.360 align:middle line:84%
about the Dagara
tribe in East Africa,

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.390 align:middle line:84%
and they were
trained to understand

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:27.730 align:middle line:84%
that it was a sacred
journey, it was

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:31.410 align:middle line:84%
that the woman's body, and
womb, and vagina were actually

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:35.550 align:middle line:84%
sacred gateways, psychic
gateways, energetic gateways

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:38.040 align:middle line:84%
that would take the man
and the woman journeying

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.136 align:middle line:90%
through whatever.

00:30:39.136 --> 00:30:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To the ancestors.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: To the ancestors.

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And I was so shocked to compare
that to go watch the cows.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:51.465 align:middle line:90%
And, oh, you got the curse.

00:30:51.465 --> 00:30:53.390 align:middle line:90%
It's pathetic.

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And so we wonder today
why the rape statistics,

00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:05.630 align:middle line:84%
and why we have little girls
on buses giving blow jobs.

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:09.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have so
trivialized, and so mechanized,

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:17.580 align:middle line:84%
and so physicalized all of our
very being, let alone this most

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:20.410 align:middle line:84%
sacred way of a man and
woman, or a man and man,

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:23.130 align:middle line:84%
or a woman and woman coming
together, and expressing love.

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:27.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh my golly, could
we get any more separated from--

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dense.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:29.289 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Dense.

00:31:29.289 --> 00:31:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On every
level, just dense.

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: On every level.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:33.310 align:middle line:90%
Sacred union.

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:35.000 align:middle line:90%
So, now, skip forward.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.040 align:middle line:90%
You get married.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And you think this
is it, Snow White.

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:41.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm living the dream, you
know, happily ever after.

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:44.760 align:middle line:84%
But now your husband,
who is an attorney,

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.970 align:middle line:84%
is stretched beyond
his capacity.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And now you're watching
from a man's point

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:50.630 align:middle line:84%
of view what happens
to their life.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:51.338 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Right.

00:31:51.338 --> 00:31:53.470 align:middle line:90%


00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:56.130 align:middle line:90%
All I worried about was mine.

00:31:56.130 --> 00:32:01.230 align:middle line:84%
He was so overwhelmed
with survival instincts,

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:05.290 align:middle line:84%
and he went into the whole
archetypal masculine,

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:08.620 align:middle line:84%
I've got to make
everything secure.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And all I wanted was love,
and tenderness, and bonding.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And that went out the
window in that relationship.

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was, again,
another example

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.970 align:middle line:84%
of the incredible
tension and bifurcation

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:25.450 align:middle line:84%
between genders and
values, and orientation.

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, it's
got to be all work,

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:30.595 align:middle line:84%
and then when I
feel secure enough,

00:32:30.595 --> 00:32:32.220 align:middle line:84%
and we've got enough
money in the bank,

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and our stock portfolio
is fluffy enough,

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:36.750 align:middle line:84%
then I can start paying
attention to you.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:43.234 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, no, it's
not this all or nothing.

00:32:43.234 --> 00:32:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's a journey.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: There's a journey.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's gotta be
balance in how we express

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.900 align:middle line:90%
and relate together.

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:52.460 align:middle line:84%
But it was his way
or the highway.

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:53.750 align:middle line:90%
And so I took the highway.

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.235 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You took the highway.

00:32:55.235 --> 00:32:58.800 align:middle line:84%
You continued building success
in your work, respect, jobs,

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.580 align:middle line:90%
you know, raises, new jobs.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:03.600 align:middle line:90%
And you were doing very well.

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And you ended up, again, in
a second marriage, and then

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.690 align:middle line:90%
miscarriage.

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:12.695 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big deal
in a woman's life.

00:33:12.695 --> 00:33:14.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: It was shocking.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And it brought me to
the place in my life

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.660 align:middle line:84%
where I finally started
asking the question who am I?

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:21.730 align:middle line:90%
Who am I really?

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd gone through
the whole journey in TV,

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:29.390 align:middle line:84%
and I am somebody because
I make XYZ amount of money,

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:31.440 align:middle line:84%
and I'm an editor,
or I'm a director.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And then I went through the
journey of husband and wife.

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:35.550 align:middle line:90%
And that wasn't it.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And then I became-- in my
second marriage I was pregnant.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And the gestation hormones,
I had actually never wanted

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:47.140 align:middle line:84%
children this lifetime, but the
gestation hormones just poof.

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:50.720 align:middle line:84%
I was in mama wonderland,
picking out baby blankets,

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and I can't wait to
paint the spare bedroom.

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:55.050 align:middle line:90%
What color?

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:57.960 align:middle line:84%
It was like, oh my golly,
who is this person?

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And so when I
miscarried, and then

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:05.000 align:middle line:84%
all of my old agendas and
soul desires came back,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.170 align:middle line:90%
it was like, well, who was that?

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And am I only BF
Skinner, and talking

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:12.659 align:middle line:90%
about a bag of chemicals.

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Am I only a sex object to be
used for a man's pleasure?

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Am I only going to have
to beat my brains out

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:22.790 align:middle line:84%
to make it in the world
until I'm exhausted.

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:24.489 align:middle line:90%
And isn't there something more?

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:27.960 align:middle line:84%
So that was in my early 30s,
and that was at the culmination

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.790 align:middle line:84%
where I bridged out of
normal material world

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:34.520 align:middle line:84%
and started to look within,
because that was by God

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:35.920 align:middle line:90%
the only place I hadn't looked.

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.864 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, then you did
the real Snow White thing.

00:34:37.864 --> 00:34:39.670 align:middle line:84%
You went and lived in a
little cabin in the woods.

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Everything but the dwarves
were with you there.

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:44.159 align:middle line:90%
You had your animals.

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:46.594 align:middle line:84%
But you had to
pick up a hatchet.

00:34:46.594 --> 00:34:48.745 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how you did it.

00:34:48.745 --> 00:34:50.870 align:middle line:84%
When I was reading that
part of the book I thought,

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:53.370 align:middle line:84%
there's no way, I couldn't
have done what you did.

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:56.420 align:middle line:84%
You hatchet-ed your way
to repairing this place,

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:59.136 align:middle line:84%
and bringing it, and restoring
this little cabin in the woods,

00:34:59.136 --> 00:35:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and stayed there
alone for three years.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.718 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Three years.

00:35:01.718 --> 00:35:02.971 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:02.971 --> 00:35:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'd been raised
on a farm, so that's

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.950 align:middle line:84%
kind of a catch-all for
being a handy person.

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:11.240 align:middle line:84%
So I was no stranger to which
end of the hammer to pick up.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.420 align:middle line:84%
But it was that
time, the first time

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:16.020 align:middle line:84%
I'd ever taken the time
to self reflective.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:18.470 align:middle line:90%
And I started to meditate.

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And I very quickly-- obviously
the veil was very thin in me,

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.700 align:middle line:84%
and I just didn't know it,
because I very quickly cracked

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.670 align:middle line:84%
my whole kundilini
energy and started--

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah, out of
body experiences, everything.

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: The whole nine yards,
which was like, oh my God.

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:33.410 align:middle line:90%
Am I crazy?

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:34.550 align:middle line:90%
What's this?

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:37.060 align:middle line:84%
But then finally my
reading caught up

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:40.870 align:middle line:90%
with my personal experiences.

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was really-- that
was the first flowering that

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:49.390 align:middle line:84%
said to me that there was
something else to journey

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:54.450 align:middle line:84%
and live for, that it wasn't
all material world and material

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:56.610 align:middle line:84%
goals, and that
there were other ways

00:35:56.610 --> 00:36:01.222 align:middle line:84%
to define myself as a human
being, and I didn't realize it.

00:36:01.222 --> 00:36:04.070 align:middle line:90%
God, hindsight is 20/20.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Until after 30 years in
the whole new age movement,

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:14.200 align:middle line:84%
for lack of better word, new
age movement, looking back I

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:19.000 align:middle line:84%
escaped the whole gender issue
and the feminine yet again.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.270 align:middle line:84%
My whole first 33
years of my life

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:24.280 align:middle line:84%
I just did the rote standard,
this is where you go.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Then I start questioning
it, and then it

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.290 align:middle line:84%
introduces me to, oh, well I can
become an illuminated master,

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and I need to go to the
light, and these out of body

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:34.690 align:middle line:84%
experiences, and, oh my god,
this is, wow, look at me.

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:36.877 align:middle line:84%
I am so much more than
I ever thought I was.

00:36:36.877 --> 00:36:38.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that brings
a certain, for everyone,

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.690 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people
watching this right now,

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:42.856 align:middle line:84%
a lot of our viewers have
been through this journey.

00:36:42.856 --> 00:36:44.770 align:middle line:84%
It also brings a
certain smugness to it.

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: Yeah,
it sure did for me.

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:47.188 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
there's a certain--

00:36:47.188 --> 00:36:48.970 align:middle line:84%
It becomes almost an
arrogance of, well,

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:50.235 align:middle line:90%
I know the real truth.

00:36:50.235 --> 00:36:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And then you want to tell
everybody the real truth.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.943 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, you don't always
have friendly ears listening,

00:36:54.943 --> 00:36:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and you wonder why all these
people are so closed minded.

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.294 align:middle line:84%
And so you did that
whole circle too.

00:36:59.294 --> 00:37:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: I did
that whole thing.

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And, again, it astonishes
me to look back and go,

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:07.130 align:middle line:84%
oh my God, I thought I was going
to be like an ascended master

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:10.180 align:middle line:84%
and become a spiritual
teacher, and yet

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:13.130 align:middle line:84%
I had not yet even
begun to clue into what

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:18.140 align:middle line:84%
it was to be a chuman being,
to deal with myself as a woman.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:21.260 align:middle line:84%
All of that was just like
safely, OK, well, now we're

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:24.050 align:middle line:90%
not supposed be sexual anyway.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:26.274 align:middle line:90%
We are spirits.

00:37:26.274 --> 00:37:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Beings having
a physical experience.

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:29.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: Beings having
a physical experience.

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And the physical experience,
even though it's beautiful,

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:34.060 align:middle line:84%
you know, I was introduced to
the whole goddess genre, which

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:37.200 align:middle line:84%
seemed kind of pale
and ineffectual.

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.037 align:middle line:90%
But wasn't that women anyway?

00:37:39.037 --> 00:37:40.370 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't that the feminine anyway?

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:43.470 align:middle line:90%
Pale and kind of ineffectual?

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:47.980 align:middle line:84%
The masculine bias in
me extended so deeply,

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:48.930 align:middle line:90%
and still does.

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:51.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm still uncovering
the nuances of it.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Even the language that I would
use, and bring to the table

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:58.980 align:middle line:84%
to even talk about the
goddess was so biased already.

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:03.610 align:middle line:84%
It was like velvet Renaissance
gowns and moon worship.

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And I dismissed
it automatically,

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.730 align:middle line:84%
because that was the
mindset that I had been in,

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:10.462 align:middle line:84%
and the bias that I
had been raised in.

00:38:10.462 --> 00:38:14.440 align:middle line:90%


00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, along
with studying, and going

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:21.249 align:middle line:84%
to channelers, and all different
things that we were-- I

00:38:21.249 --> 00:38:23.790 align:middle line:84%
did all the same things at the
same time you were doing them,

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:24.290 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:26.520 align:middle line:90%
I totally get it.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And like you, I
tried to take home

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:31.920 align:middle line:84%
the wonderful news about herbs
and vitamins to my family,

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.490 align:middle line:90%
you know, to the hive.

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
those profound moments

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:38.200 align:middle line:84%
in the book that
just is startling.

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.100 align:middle line:90%
It just makes you want to cry.

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.650 align:middle line:90%
You tried to help your mother.

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:43.250 align:middle line:84%
You thought I have
this new knowledge.

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:44.210 align:middle line:90%
I can help my mother.

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:46.630 align:middle line:84%
I know she doesn't want to
hear about my weirdo aspects,

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.880 align:middle line:84%
but I can at least bring
home some information for her

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.120 align:middle line:90%
on a healing level.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.510 align:middle line:84%
She was having
physical problems,

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:54.120 align:middle line:84%
and you wanted to tell her
about some herbs or vitamins,

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.360 align:middle line:84%
or minerals, or
something at the time.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Share that conversation
and what happened.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.630 align:middle line:84%
She'd already shut you
out on the metaphysical.

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:01.338 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Right.

00:39:01.338 --> 00:39:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, you're
back with some good news

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.212 align:middle line:84%
on a physical level,
alternative medicine.

00:39:06.212 --> 00:39:08.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: My mother had
her first heart attack

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:11.440 align:middle line:84%
when she was 45, which is not
surprising considering how

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.140 align:middle line:84%
shut down she was
supposed to be.

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:13.990 align:middle line:90%
She was heartbroken.

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:17.160 align:middle line:84%
She was never allowed to be
her beautiful self, whatever

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:19.010 align:middle line:90%
that was.

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And so when I started presenting
the alternative medical models

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:29.990 align:middle line:84%
and ideas, she was
equally distressed,

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:32.230 align:middle line:90%
and didn't want any part of it.

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:35.240 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand it until
she finally got in my face,

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:41.560 align:middle line:84%
literally shouted, crying, that,
I don't want to know myself,

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:45.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't like myself,
I hate myself,

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:48.020 align:middle line:90%
can you just drop all of this.

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:52.520 align:middle line:90%
And that was beyond shocking.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what to do
with it except be respectful,

00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:00.480 align:middle line:84%
and back away from anything
that would smack of a healing.

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:04.580 align:middle line:84%
But she was so
resistant, because she

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.190 align:middle line:84%
thought so little
of herself, Regina.

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:13.060 align:middle line:84%
She had such a complete
negative, insecure self hatred

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:15.980 align:middle line:84%
that was the same thing
that was gnawing away

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.110 align:middle line:84%
in me, that was that
old DNA programs

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:21.460 align:middle line:84%
about feminine worthlessness,
and that she had never

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:22.530 align:middle line:90%
been allowed to express.

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:25.840 align:middle line:84%
She had no idea how beautiful
and what her heart was like.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And so the metaphysical
terrified her,

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:30.550 align:middle line:84%
because it was
going to take her--

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You wanted her to,
as I remember you saying,

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:35.690 align:middle line:90%
she needed to look inside.

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:37.780 align:middle line:84%
The answer to her health
issues were inside,

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.644 align:middle line:90%
and that's what triggered that.

00:40:39.644 --> 00:40:40.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to look inside.

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:41.910 align:middle line:90%
I hate myself.

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:43.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Exactly.

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so not
even to save herself.

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:46.274 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: No.

00:40:46.274 --> 00:40:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
that's not uncommon.

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:49.770 align:middle line:84%
I saw that a lot
with people as well.

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:52.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like I don't want to do--
I don't want to look inside,

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:54.660 align:middle line:84%
because people, and
women in particular,

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.820 align:middle line:84%
are so terrified of what
they're going to see.

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:57.736 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Absolutely.

00:40:57.736 --> 00:40:59.615 align:middle line:84%
Because we've been so
indelibly ingrained

00:40:59.615 --> 00:41:02.440 align:middle line:84%
in thinking that what's
inside of us is demonic.

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look at
a patriarchal mindset,

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:05.750 align:middle line:90%
and this is by no--

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Go back to
the Adam and Eve story.

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:07.926 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Yeah.

00:41:07.926 --> 00:41:10.620 align:middle line:90%
And this is no way anti male.

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:14.460 align:middle line:84%
We have masculine principles
and the feminine principles.

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Yin and Yang.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And the masculine is,
I've said it before,

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:24.490 align:middle line:84%
tends toward structure, tends
toward law, rule, static.

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:25.600 align:middle line:90%
This is what's right.

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.030 align:middle line:90%
This is what's wrong.

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:28.370 align:middle line:90%
Live or die by it.

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And structure
has value as well.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:30.725 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: Structure
has great value.

00:41:30.725 --> 00:41:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:32.591 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: Structure
has great value.

00:41:32.591 --> 00:41:37.800 align:middle line:84%
But it also means that the
more fluid, dynamic, chaotic

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:43.530 align:middle line:84%
even if you will, the darkness
of the womb of the feminine-- I

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:47.620 align:middle line:84%
mean, the masculine has always
been related to the light.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sun.

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: The sun, which
is the light of intellect,

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and intelligence, consciousness,
the abstract, and the law,

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.860 align:middle line:84%
versus the chaotic,
the dark, the moon,

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:01.270 align:middle line:84%
the reflected light
of the feminine,

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:03.240 align:middle line:84%
which is utterly
uncontrollable, which

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:06.730 align:middle line:84%
was why I was so intoxicated
with nature as a little girl.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:11.350 align:middle line:84%
It was my first, oh my god,
there really is a realm here

00:42:11.350 --> 00:42:15.350 align:middle line:84%
that we can operate in in a
completely different manner.

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:17.830 align:middle line:90%
And then life happened.

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:21.355 align:middle line:84%
And then finally
now as an adult,

00:42:21.355 --> 00:42:23.690 align:middle line:84%
and after my mother
died, it was just like,

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:26.940 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, this is a
realm of the femin--

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:28.930 align:middle line:84%
This is something
I have to explore.

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:30.260 align:middle line:90%
This killed my mother.

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:34.210 align:middle line:84%
This is a negative,
unhappy space in me

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:37.235 align:middle line:84%
that undoubtedly is going to
be affecting me health wise.

00:42:37.235 --> 00:42:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
you're a total warrioress

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:41.710 align:middle line:84%
because you had no
fear of any boundaries.

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:44.790 align:middle line:84%
There came a time where you
just said, I'm here to learn.

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:48.920 align:middle line:84%
And so now comes the time,
you've left the cabin,

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.130 align:middle line:84%
you've moved to the
state of Washington.

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:52.690 align:middle line:90%
And now you go on a road trip.

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:54.240 align:middle line:90%
We'll scoot ahead a little bit.

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:57.170 align:middle line:84%
You go on a road trip
with a group of women

00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:59.240 align:middle line:84%
and a friend named
Tess to the southwest,

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.600 align:middle line:84%
and a whole new chapter
emerges because you're

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.320 align:middle line:84%
going to find out what
it is to be a woman.

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: Well,
to cut to the chase

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:07.194 align:middle line:84%
I ended up, after
three husbands,

00:43:07.194 --> 00:43:10.920 align:middle line:84%
falling in love with a
woman, my best friend.

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:16.641 align:middle line:84%
She and I did a ceremony
in the desert using MDMA.

00:43:16.641 --> 00:43:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's called
the spirit molecule.

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:20.181 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: It's called
the spirit molecule.

00:43:20.181 --> 00:43:23.170 align:middle line:90%
And I saw the goddess Gaia.

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:26.080 align:middle line:90%
I saw the spirit of Earth.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And everything, it
was like a flashback

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:31.574 align:middle line:90%
to when I was a kid on my pony.

00:43:31.574 --> 00:43:34.240 align:middle line:84%
It was just like all of a sudden
the whole world just opened up,

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:37.730 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, oh my god,
here's life as a palpable,

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:42.450 align:middle line:84%
conscious intelligence, and
a force to be reckoned with.

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:44.990 align:middle line:90%


00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:47.917 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, I did happen to
fall in love with Tess.

00:43:47.917 --> 00:43:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you were partners.

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: And we are
partners for ten years.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:52.329 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:43:52.329 --> 00:43:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The lesbian world was
very different than the world

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:58.040 align:middle line:84%
you had just come out of, and
there were certain topics,

00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:59.950 align:middle line:90%
and ways of relating, and--

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:01.914 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: It was relational.

00:44:01.914 --> 00:44:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:03.080 align:middle line:90%
relational.

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: It was emotional.

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:08.380 align:middle line:90%
And it was intoxicating in that.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And I, again, upon
reflection have realized,

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:15.410 align:middle line:84%
I was so closed and so
jaundiced and prejudiced

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:19.710 align:middle line:84%
against all things feminine,
growing up the way I grew up,

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:22.960 align:middle line:84%
that I actually had
to bring a woman to me

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.030 align:middle line:90%
to start to love the feminine.

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:27.540 align:middle line:84%
God knows I couldn't look in
the mirror and do it myself.

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:28.206 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:28.206 --> 00:44:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: And so when I
fell in love with Tess,

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:33.000 align:middle line:84%
I brought a reflection
of the feminine.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And, oh my god, and her
insecurity and her fears,

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and her, what looked
like weaknesses,

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:40.870 align:middle line:90%
which was just vulnerability.

00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:44.060 align:middle line:84%
What a concept,
vulnerability, to be open,

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:47.140 align:middle line:84%
and to be willing
to let life happen.

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And she and all
my women friends,

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:51.700 align:middle line:84%
because almost
literally overnight I

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:55.320 align:middle line:84%
went from being completely in
a world of men, to completely

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.910 align:middle line:84%
in a world of
lesbians, and, I mean,

00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:58.773 align:middle line:90%
even my mechanic was a lesbian.

00:44:58.773 --> 00:45:01.672 align:middle line:84%
It was just like, oh my God,
where did all the men go?

00:45:01.672 --> 00:45:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're gone.

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:04.110 align:middle line:84%
That's not your
lesson at the moment.

00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:06.109 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: That was not
my lesson at the moment.

00:45:06.109 --> 00:45:09.570 align:middle line:84%
So that was an amazing
10 year journey.

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's a whole book in itself
what I learned during that.

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it is
a fascinating thing.

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And as you went through this,
you learned probably more

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:21.275 align:middle line:84%
about yourself than you
had learned before up

00:45:21.275 --> 00:45:24.540 align:middle line:84%
to that point, and about
femininity, and about where

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:26.600 align:middle line:84%
the feminine just
runs over and becomes

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.330 align:middle line:90%
as masculine as the masculine.

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk
about the split up,

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:33.080 align:middle line:84%
when you finally went
separate ways with Tess.

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.339 align:middle line:90%
I thought that was hysterical.

00:45:34.339 --> 00:45:35.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had to
say, I was laughing.

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:36.320 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't have.

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.200 align:middle line:90%
But I was laughing.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:41.430 align:middle line:90%


00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Tell everybody what
she said to you.

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:46.400 align:middle line:84%
First of all, so during
this period you thought,

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.400 align:middle line:84%
hey, I do not have to
impress men any more.

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Nope.

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:49.991 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I don't need make up.

00:45:49.991 --> 00:45:51.400 align:middle line:90%
I can put on a few pounds.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.775 align:middle line:84%
So you know, packed
on 50 pounds.

00:45:52.775 --> 00:45:54.774 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: I don't have
to wear make up anymore.

00:45:54.774 --> 00:45:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.799 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to be
feminine anymore.

00:45:56.799 --> 00:46:00.430 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, after 10 years
together she just looked at me

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:02.390 align:middle line:84%
and she said, I'm in
love with somebody else.

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:04.100 align:middle line:84%
You're just not--
She just reflects

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:07.040 align:middle line:84%
such beauty of womanhood
to me, and you're not

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:10.402 align:middle line:90%
feminine enough for me.

00:46:10.402 --> 00:46:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A woman left you
for someone more feminine.

00:46:12.610 --> 00:46:13.130 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Oh my God.

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:18.202 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do with that?

00:46:18.202 --> 00:46:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
looked in the mirror.

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:21.993 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: I looked in the
mirror, and I was like,

00:46:21.993 --> 00:46:24.840 align:middle line:84%
OK, I had embraced the
feminine, but I had not

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.570 align:middle line:90%
embodied the feminine.

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And so that put me on
a several year journey,

00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:33.720 align:middle line:84%
and I was down in South
America, and one of the greatest

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:37.820 align:middle line:84%
teachers I have ever met is
ayahuasca, a feminine plant

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:38.710 align:middle line:90%
medicine.

00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:40.700 align:middle line:90%
And I stress the word medicine.

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:42.540 align:middle line:84%
She is not anything
recreational.

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:45.060 align:middle line:84%
She is a consciousness
and a healer.

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And I worked with
several shamans

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:49.230 align:middle line:90%
down in Peru, and in Ecuador.

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And ayahuasca opened
me for the first time

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:58.420 align:middle line:84%
into the-- that
dark place within me

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:00.160 align:middle line:90%
that had never been addressed.

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:03.970 align:middle line:84%
20 years-- Now, I could
go into a somadee state.

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:05.420 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:08.710 align:middle line:84%
25, I could leave my
body almost at will.

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:12.820 align:middle line:84%
I admit, I had the medication
and the spiritual groove

00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:14.890 align:middle line:90%
down just great.

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:17.100 align:middle line:84%
But then she took
me into my body,

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:19.940 align:middle line:84%
and showed me what was
locked into my DNA,

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:22.030 align:middle line:90%
and issues in my soul.

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And my very first journey with
ayahuasca, I was like, well,

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:27.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to guide the
energy up my spine,

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:29.334 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
blossom the pineal.

00:47:29.334 --> 00:47:30.250 align:middle line:90%
And then I'm going to.

00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:32.124 align:middle line:84%
And that was my intent
going in, and she just

00:47:32.124 --> 00:47:36.950 align:middle line:84%
hammered me, and took me,
crushed me like a boulder,

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and took me into my genetics
and the pattern that

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:41.780 align:middle line:84%
had killed my mother and
killed my grandmother, which

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:45.340 align:middle line:84%
was this ancient
self loathing that

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:51.205 align:middle line:84%
was the feminine inheritance,
my feminine inheritance, why

00:47:51.205 --> 00:47:53.520 align:middle line:84%
I had eschewed the feminine
and never gone there

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.210 align:middle line:90%
all of my life.

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:57.870 align:middle line:90%
And it was so horrific.

00:47:57.870 --> 00:48:00.740 align:middle line:84%
It took me back
to those early age

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:04.180 align:middle line:84%
four memories, DNA,
cellular, soul,

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:07.375 align:middle line:84%
lifetime memories of
being incarcerated,

00:48:07.375 --> 00:48:11.160 align:middle line:84%
of being tortured, of being
raped, being endlessly

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:13.500 align:middle line:84%
subjugated and
suppressed, and never

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:18.840 align:middle line:84%
allowed to shine, and be the
beautiful, radiant, life force

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:21.500 align:middle line:84%
breathing goddess
that we all are.

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And the feminine is
in men as well as.

00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:24.800 align:middle line:90%
It's the feminine principle.

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's that unbridled,
passionate, glorious place

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.410 align:middle line:84%
that allows and
enables everything.

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:32.690 align:middle line:90%
It's the creative force.

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:38.020 align:middle line:84%
So that was my introduction
to deep body work,

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:41.190 align:middle line:84%
and my first real
introduction to where

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:45.230 align:middle line:84%
I had to go to
unearth my feminine.

00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I did a lot of
ceremonial work with ayahuasca.

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then you ended
up in Central America and Costa

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:54.460 align:middle line:90%
Rica.

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And you were, again, going
out of the flow of your life

00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:03.270 align:middle line:84%
that you had built into the area
of exploration, which I totally

00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:05.920 align:middle line:84%
admire the fact you've just
taken these chunks of time

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.350 align:middle line:90%
to just go explore.

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:08.910 align:middle line:90%
And the sweetest thing happened.

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about the
sweetest thing in Costa Rica.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.860 align:middle line:84%
One had to do with,
I think you were

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:14.290 align:middle line:90%
going to be issued a citation.

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And the way the men
would view women

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:19.570 align:middle line:84%
in Costa Rica,
which was so sweet.

00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:24.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: It is truly
a land of the feminine,

00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:26.500 align:middle line:90%
and the men appreciated.

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:28.000 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I would be whistled at.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And men would hand
me flowers as I

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:35.300 align:middle line:84%
would-- Old men, young men, as
I would take my morning walk.

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:40.400 align:middle line:84%
But it was never anything lewd
or licentious, or come on baby.

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:43.160 align:middle line:84%
It was none of that,
no overtones like that.

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, yes, I got
a speeding ticket one day.

00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And the officer, you know,
he's handing me the ticket.

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.340 align:middle line:90%
And his mustache is drooping.

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:50.756 align:middle line:84%
And he kisses my
hand, and he says

00:49:50.756 --> 00:49:52.500 align:middle line:90%
what beautiful eyes I have.

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And he's just so sorry
he has to do this,

00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:58.120 align:middle line:84%
but 20,000 calones
will make it go away.

00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And he kissed my hand
again when I gave him

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.480 align:middle line:84%
the 20,000-- you
know, it was 20 bucks.

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:06.126 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And explained
he has kids in school?

00:50:06.126 --> 00:50:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: And explained
he had children in college

00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:09.749 align:middle line:84%
that he was putting
through college.

00:50:09.749 --> 00:50:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And bribery was
the way to do it.

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:14.530 align:middle line:84%
I was happy to give
him the 20 bucks.

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:20.160 align:middle line:84%
But it was such a, after
the real deep, nitty gritty,

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:24.740 align:middle line:84%
internal work I did with
shamans and with ayahuasca.

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:26.880 align:middle line:84%
I was ready for a
different kind of healing.

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to the jungle,
borgidvia and every flower

00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:35.170 align:middle line:90%
known to creation was there.

00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was such a
soft and gentle land.

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And deeply, the natural world
is the icon of Costa Rica.

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:49.880 align:middle line:84%
It's in the environmental
kingdom of the world.

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I was nurtured
in a whole new way.

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:54.930 align:middle line:90%
And I gave myself that.

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:59.415 align:middle line:84%
I took a year and a half
down there and just started

00:50:59.415 --> 00:51:00.040 align:middle line:90%
writing a book.

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:02.206 align:middle line:84%
I did do some work, and
actually wrote a screenplay,

00:51:02.206 --> 00:51:07.220 align:middle line:84%
but aside from that I just
be'd, and soaked it up.

00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:09.897 align:middle line:84%
And so that was my first
kind of-- And I came back,

00:51:09.897 --> 00:51:10.980 align:middle line:90%
and I lost all the weight.

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And I totally took
my hair to blonde.

00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
like, oh, and I was

00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:19.020 align:middle line:90%
in my body in a whole new way.

00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was with my soul
in a whole new way.

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you had
started integrating

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:28.160 align:middle line:84%
what all the ancient traditions
see as this spirit that

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:33.097 align:middle line:84%
whispers the information into
physical form of the feminine,

00:51:33.097 --> 00:51:34.430 align:middle line:90%
and that's how it's always been.

00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: It was no longer
a token idea about, oh yes,

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:40.400 align:middle line:84%
the material world
is spirit made flesh.

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.245 align:middle line:90%
Hum.

00:51:41.245 --> 00:51:43.400 align:middle line:90%
You know, let's go to the light.

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:48.970 align:middle line:84%
It was this is really,
really where it's at.

00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And I had a really
terrifying experience

00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:58.180 align:middle line:84%
in South America, where the camp
of the ayahuascaro I was with

00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:00.700 align:middle line:90%
was under a bandit attack.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And I could have well
ended up hacked, and raped,

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:05.550 align:middle line:84%
and mutilated yet
one more lifetime.

00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:06.780 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work out that way.

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:11.360 align:middle line:84%
But in that dark moment of
terror, and gunfire, and dogs

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:17.292 align:middle line:84%
it was just like, where was
somadee when I needed it.

00:52:17.292 --> 00:52:18.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's just
like oh my God,

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:22.560 align:middle line:84%
all those years of meditation,
where the hell was it,

00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:25.382 align:middle line:84%
and what good did it do me
at that point in my life?

00:52:25.382 --> 00:52:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
you came down to

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:29.420 align:middle line:90%
is it's a really basic battle.

00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's a
beautiful letter that

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:34.790 align:middle line:84%
was written by Thomas Jefferson
called "My Heart and My

00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:37.870 align:middle line:84%
Head" to the woman he
loved, Maria Cosway.

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And you came down
to this very thing.

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:42.690 align:middle line:84%
In the end, masculine,
feminine, call it what you want.

00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:44.660 align:middle line:84%
You had done your
own integration.

00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:47.684 align:middle line:84%
It was coming down to the
simple heart and the head.

00:52:47.684 --> 00:52:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Absolutely.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:52.290 align:middle line:84%
They do not do well
without one another.

00:52:52.290 --> 00:52:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They do not.

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: They do not.

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.535 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, now,
I want to go somewhere

00:52:55.535 --> 00:52:57.880 align:middle line:84%
where we weren't planning on,
but you told me off camera.

00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:58.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Ah yes.

00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:59.524 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:52:59.524 --> 00:53:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Here we go.

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:01.815 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now,
here you go again.

00:53:01.815 --> 00:53:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And you went back into
the world of relationship

00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:12.160 align:middle line:84%
with a man that offered a
whole new opportunity, slash

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.080 align:middle line:84%
challenge, slash horror
in your life, which

00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:17.570 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the
subject of your next book.

00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, I can't really
quite-- Yeah, go ahead.

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: OK, so I've done
all this wonderful integration.

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:28.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling as fem
as could possibly be,

00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:32.120 align:middle line:84%
and spending a lot less time in
meditation and a lot more time

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:36.280 align:middle line:84%
feeling every emotion, feeling
what my body's message is,

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:38.690 align:middle line:84%
and becoming a
walking meditation,

00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:41.100 align:middle line:84%
and it's been an
astounding integration.

00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So I take that,
and I fall in love

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:47.650 align:middle line:84%
with a younger man who ends up
after almost a year and a half

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:50.670 align:middle line:84%
of seeing each other to be
a fundamentalist Christian.

00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:51.850 align:middle line:90%
And he laid it on the line.

00:53:51.850 --> 00:53:55.170 align:middle line:84%
For us to get married, I had
to come to Jesus through him,

00:53:55.170 --> 00:54:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and be saved from my wretched,
pagan, feminist, sinful ways.

00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:04.795 align:middle line:90%
And he'd hidden it from me.

00:54:04.795 --> 00:54:06.810 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not stupid.

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:10.039 align:middle line:84%
But he-- Because he knew
it would undoubtedly--

00:54:10.039 --> 00:54:11.705 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
really loved this man.

00:54:11.705 --> 00:54:13.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this was a very
passionate wonderful.

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:14.884 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: This
was my soul mate.

00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:18.460 align:middle line:84%
This was the man that I'd
been waiting lifetimes for.

00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never been in
love like that, Regina.

00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:23.270 align:middle line:90%
And so I tried it on.

00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:26.790 align:middle line:84%
I did the doggonedest
I could, and actually

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:29.655 align:middle line:84%
went into a non
meditative state where

00:54:29.655 --> 00:54:33.830 align:middle line:84%
I negated any connection with
the divine, where I negated

00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:37.040 align:middle line:84%
all spiritual light
within me, and where

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.060 align:middle line:84%
I was a wretched, damned
sinner, and that I

00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:44.260 align:middle line:84%
had to be rescued by Jesus
and fit into this story

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:47.620 align:middle line:84%
that Jehovah had cooked up
for me as one of the elite,

00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:49.310 align:middle line:84%
because obviously
if I came to Jesus,

00:54:49.310 --> 00:54:52.490 align:middle line:84%
I was one of the
elite and the elect.

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I can't
believe you did that.

00:54:54.730 --> 00:54:56.521 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: That was
only one night, Regina.

00:54:56.521 --> 00:54:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: After everything
you'd been through.

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: And it was the
most horrific, demon ridden,

00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:08.900 align:middle line:84%
dark hellhole I had ever put
myself in in consciousness.

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And I came out of that
experience realizing, well,

00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:17.890 align:middle line:84%
not only could I not go there
and accept the parameters

00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:19.950 align:middle line:84%
of our marriage, and
that was of course

00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:22.060 align:middle line:84%
the death knell of the
relationship, which

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:24.830 align:middle line:84%
was incredibly, incredibly
hard to go through,

00:55:24.830 --> 00:55:27.546 align:middle line:84%
but it put me on a
totally unexpected path.

00:55:27.546 --> 00:55:29.630 align:middle line:10%
If I thought writing
about the feminine

00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:32.880 align:middle line:10%
was an unexpected path,
writing about anything to do

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:36.330 align:middle line:10%
with fundamentalist, Abrahamic
based fundamentalism,

00:55:36.330 --> 00:55:39.900 align:middle line:10%
whether it be Islam,
Judaism, or Christianity

00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:42.200 align:middle line:10%
is about the last place I
thought I would never go.

00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:47.700 align:middle line:10%
But I was so shocked to see
how completely my newly found

00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:53.110 align:middle line:10%
nurtured, beautiful, feminine,
body oriented, fully sexual,

00:55:53.110 --> 00:55:57.440 align:middle line:10%
fully engaged, passionate,
sometimes chaotic,

00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:01.860 align:middle line:10%
rich life had been completely
just-- That is not worth it.

00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:03.010 align:middle line:90%
I can't go there.

00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:05.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's just like oh my God.

00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:07.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's the whole next
book is the demonization

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:11.510 align:middle line:84%
of the feminine and the
soul that these religions

00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and that kind of
fundamentalism has taken us to,

00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:16.400 align:middle line:84%
and is still ripping
us apart to this day.

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:17.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a stunning story.

00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is one of
the weirdest epilogues.

00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:24.799 align:middle line:84%
If you could have told me any
story to follow up that book,

00:56:24.799 --> 00:56:26.590 align:middle line:84%
that's the last thing
I would have guessed.

00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:27.298 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Right.

00:56:27.298 --> 00:56:27.800 align:middle line:90%
Me, too.

00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But,
again, like I said.

00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:32.510 align:middle line:84%
You are one of the most
intrepid people on the planet.

00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:35.620 align:middle line:84%
I've never read a
story of a woman who

00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:39.340 align:middle line:84%
just wanted to go head on and
face everything, and to know,

00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:41.890 align:middle line:84%
to go that deep into
knowing, and express

00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:45.200 align:middle line:84%
all these aspects of
life in one lifetime.

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:46.814 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a wild ride.

00:56:46.814 --> 00:56:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: It has
been a real wild ride.

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:49.334 align:middle line:90%
It ain't over yet.

00:56:49.334 --> 00:56:50.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And not only that.

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:52.770 align:middle line:84%
You're an absolutely
beautiful writer.

00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:53.780 align:middle line:90%
I was very impressed.

00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:57.240 align:middle line:84%
But you told me, we were
talking on the phone,

00:56:57.240 --> 00:56:59.160 align:middle line:84%
a little bit before
I read this book when

00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:01.860 align:middle line:84%
we had arranged for this
interview, and I said,

00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:02.800 align:middle line:90%
I am so tired.

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:04.640 align:middle line:84%
I've got so many
different books lined up

00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:06.540 align:middle line:84%
to read right now to get
ready for the next interview,

00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:07.890 align:middle line:90%
and I'm just kind of pushed.

00:57:07.890 --> 00:57:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And you said, oh,
you're going to hate me.

00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:10.919 align:middle line:90%
This is a page turner.

00:57:10.919 --> 00:57:11.460 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:14.830 align:middle line:90%


00:57:14.830 --> 00:57:17.050 align:middle line:90%
Your story was a page turner.

00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So how long's it going
to take before we

00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:22.264 align:middle line:84%
get to see this
next weird story?

00:57:22.264 --> 00:57:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: I'm talking
to Hay House now.

00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:25.910 align:middle line:90%
I think 2015 fall.

00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 2015 fall.

00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:27.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:28.942 align:middle line:90%
So come back on the show then.

00:57:28.942 --> 00:57:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MONTANA: I would
love to, Regina.

00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.108 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, because
this yin yang thing

00:57:32.108 --> 00:57:34.430 align:middle line:84%
is going to take a long time
for all of us to work out.

00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:35.388 align:middle line:90%
It's embedded so deeply

00:57:35.388 --> 00:57:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: It's enormous.

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Within our psyche.

00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:38.500 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MONTANA: Thank you.

00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:41.836 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So for me, the message
is that we can no longer afford

00:57:41.836 --> 00:57:43.870 align:middle line:10%
to operate on only half
of our consciousness,

00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:45.890 align:middle line:10%
be it male or
female, but it will

00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:48.370 align:middle line:10%
take conscious words,
reactions, and understanding

00:57:48.370 --> 00:57:51.130 align:middle line:10%
to bring the masculine and
feminine into balance within us

00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:52.370 align:middle line:10%
and our world.

00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Cate's beautifully written
memoir, "Unearthing Venus."

00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:59.941 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
