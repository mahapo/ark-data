>>LAURIE MCDONALD:
There are so many that

00:00:16.828 --> 00:00:18.900 align:middle line:84%
come to visit with
their own agendas.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.040 align:middle line:84%
My concern, actually, is when
people appear disempowered,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.510 align:middle line:84%
then we are opening ourselves
up to be taken advantage

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.075 align:middle line:90%
of from an extraterrestrial.

00:00:29.075 --> 00:00:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're so
vulnerable because we simply

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.910 align:middle line:84%
have amnesia, not because
we lack capability.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: It is up to us
ultimately to save ourselves.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.810 align:middle line:84%
This third dimensional
dualistic reality,

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.490 align:middle line:90%
there are two things to master.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.650 align:middle line:90%
One is love, the other is fear.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And when we understand
the dualistic nature

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.870 align:middle line:84%
of both of those things,
we're accelerating

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.050 align:middle line:90%
our spiritual understanding.

And today, we're
going to be talking

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.830 align:middle line:84%
about contacting
ETs via regression

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.960 align:middle line:84%
and their effect
on the experiencer.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.040 align:middle line:84%
One question Laurie will
answer is, is ET contact

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.780 align:middle line:90%
a spiritual awakening?

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.575 align:middle line:84%
Because that's how a lot of
people render it later on.

00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:18.700 align:middle line:84%
But we're not to that part
in the conversation yet,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.540 align:middle line:90%

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.543 align:middle line:90%

in more patterns and such.

00:01:40.305 --> 00:01:41.680 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
talk about what is

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.040 align:middle line:84%
new in the commonalities
of these experiences.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.955 align:middle line:90%
Because it changes.

00:01:45.955 --> 00:01:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: It does change.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.497 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It changes as the
era changes, the years change,

00:01:49.497 --> 00:01:51.470 align:middle line:90%
and a lot has changed.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: So the ETs
maybe getting bolder.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, there you go.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.920 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let's
talk about that.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Is this coming through
more when you're

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.730 align:middle line:90%
doing your regression work now?

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.980 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: It is coming
through in a regression work,

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.140 align:middle line:10%
but not only there.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.710 align:middle line:10%
Working with a set
amount of experiencers

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.090 align:middle line:10%

old mines on the land.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mines?

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, so gold mines.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.990 align:middle line:90%
Malachite, in particular.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we live right
in the Sierra foothills,

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.480 align:middle line:90%
practically.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Well, I do.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.250 align:middle line:90%
You're nearby.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Where all those old gold
mines have been abandoned.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.280 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: And have
always had anomalous

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.120 align:middle line:10%
and extraterrestrial--

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.920 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Now--

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.970 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: --sightings
around them.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --we talk about,
Michael Tellinger talks

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.790 align:middle line:90%
about it, South Africa.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Does he?

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And, yeah.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And the gold mining of
the original slave species

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.835 align:middle line:90%
of the gods and all that.

00:02:39.835 --> 00:02:41.710 align:middle line:84%
But now, let's talk
about what you're saying.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Because you're saying this
has been going on all along.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:44.847 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: All along.

00:02:44.847 --> 00:02:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I think that they're still
interested in our minerals

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.040 align:middle line:84%
and a particular element
that they may need.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:90%
Not all extraterrestrials.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.990 align:middle line:84%
There are so many that come to
visit with their own agendas.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.780 align:middle line:84%
But there's an object
that has recently

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.700 align:middle line:84%
appeared on site of
one of my experiencers.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're out in the desert,
and there's really no reason

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.960 align:middle line:84%
for this, other than the old
mines that have been left

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.400 align:middle line:84%
abandoned there
that he now owns.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is this out
of Nevada or California?

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Nevada.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.863 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot of
silver mines there,

00:03:20.863 --> 00:03:23.270 align:middle line:90%
in particular, and other metals.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Other metals
and other minerals.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.090 align:middle line:84%
So they're interested in
a lot, not just the gold.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the gold, that
whole gathering of gold

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.370 align:middle line:90%
was for a specific reason.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.633 align:middle line:84%
And it was the Anunnaki using
it to stabilize their output.

00:03:37.633 --> 00:03:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the story
people are familiar with.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, it's
like our chem trails.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, have another
purpose outside

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.970 align:middle line:84%
of what people think when
they're spraying worldwide.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.280 align:middle line:84%
I've seen them in
every continent

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.330 align:middle line:90%
that I've traveled to.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I
have too, actually.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.930 align:middle line:84%
So, OK, so let's get back
to, just for a moment, just

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.470 align:middle line:84%
tell us what the element
is that they seem

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.040 align:middle line:90%
to be looking for right now.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: No.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.430 align:middle line:90%
We're keeping that back so far.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm having a Science
Committee look at it.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And when they get back to me,
then I'll be screaming it.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.519 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you first
if you want, Regina.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, tell us first.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.649 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Other people
have already talked too.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:19.899 align:middle line:90%
It's not that big of a secret.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:25.280 align:middle line:84%
But there is evidence indicating
that certain extraterrestrials

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.560 align:middle line:90%
are still mining our planet.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And an object has
recently been found

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.210 align:middle line:84%
that's being brought
into the office,

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
have a look at it.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.100 align:middle line:84%
I'll probably be involved
some of the people at ops,

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.080 align:middle line:84%
and have them take
a look at it and see

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.370 align:middle line:90%
what we can come up with.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.375 align:middle line:84%
Just, is it mineral
rather than--

00:04:43.375 --> 00:04:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm not playing
to any questions.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: No, it's mineral.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's mineral.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: It is
mineral for sure.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And so the experiences
are changing.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.880 align:middle line:90%
The ETs are not--

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.390 align:middle line:84%
I think that they know
that the presence of them

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.210 align:middle line:90%
is almost accepted now.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.647 align:middle line:84%
I think the whole terminology
change from UFO to UAP--

00:05:03.647 --> 00:05:05.480 align:middle line:84%
that's how the government
takes things over.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.910 align:middle line:84%
They give it a new title,
they change the name,

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.145 align:middle line:90%
and they begin to--

00:05:09.145 --> 00:05:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --the
"New York Times."

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --that and-- exactly.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.260 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And then we see it in
the "Washington Post."

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, absolutely.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.880 align:middle line:84%
So but definitely when
they changed the name,

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.230 align:middle line:90%
things began to change.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.460 align:middle line:90%
They're letting it out.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.500 align:middle line:90%
But that's their--

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You mean UAPs?

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.190 align:middle line:90%
Changing in UAP?

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, no.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Unidentified Aerial
Phenomena instead of UFO.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.752 align:middle line:84%
And that was just in
the last five years.

00:05:32.752 --> 00:05:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Well, yeah.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And they did that specifically
for some committees

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:37.860 align:middle line:90%
that they created.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: But
they know and have

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.800 align:middle line:90%
known for a very long time.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.290 align:middle line:84%
But the ETs are becoming
a little bit bolder.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.670 align:middle line:84%
You know how all the sightings
are primarily at night

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.875 align:middle line:84%
or when it's ambiguous,
or ones showing up

00:05:50.875 --> 00:05:53.000 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the night
at the foot of your bed,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.960 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.590 align:middle line:90%
Not so much anymore.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.080 align:middle line:84%
It's more daytime, face to
face, eye to eye contact.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.740 align:middle line:84%
People have said they want more
conscious lucid experiences,

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.530 align:middle line:90%
and they are experiencing that.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Got a whole group of people
vectoring in and calling

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.480 align:middle line:90%
in UFOs.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.430 align:middle line:90%
But what are we seeing?

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's very difficult with
the ability to group manifest.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.840 align:middle line:90%
Are they creating?

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.530 align:middle line:90%
Are they conjuring?

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.493 align:middle line:84%
Or the UFOs just waiting
there to reveal themselves?

00:06:24.493 --> 00:06:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And all
these things are

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.640 align:middle line:84%
questions that we should be
asking rather than accepting

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.972 align:middle line:90%
a flat, one-dimensional answer.

00:06:29.972 --> 00:06:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Absolutely.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I agree.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: So I have a lot
of older people interested

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.600 align:middle line:90%
in past experiences now.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.730 align:middle line:90%
70 to 75 years old.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.470 align:middle line:84%
They've had experiences
in their youth.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.110 align:middle line:84%
They're, again,
getting on in age

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.540 align:middle line:84%
and they want to have answers
before they check out.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.890 align:middle line:84%
So now you're talking
about this boldness.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.220 align:middle line:84%
So when you're doing
regressions on humans,

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.410 align:middle line:84%
are you finding
that ETs are often

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.630 align:middle line:84%
now tapping in on
from the other side

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.150 align:middle line:84%
and coming maybe
through them or to them?

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, they're
communicating during a session.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.060 align:middle line:84%
The ET said this or said that,
or believes this or that.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.860 align:middle line:90%
And we can--

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.068 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Almost like when
Dolores Cannon was working

00:07:09.068 --> 00:07:11.180 align:middle line:84%
and they started telling
her a couple of subjects,

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.080 align:middle line:90%
a bunch of stuff.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.640 align:middle line:90%
So you're experiencing this?

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Quite a bit.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Quite a bit of information
is coming through.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.650 align:middle line:84%
We are so incredibly
busy with everybody

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.050 align:middle line:84%
coming in wanting
regressions or having,

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.570 align:middle line:84%
not particularly
extraterrestrial abduction

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:33.080 align:middle line:84%
experiences, but contact,
or they receiving downloads,

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.880 align:middle line:90%
or they feel that--

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.770 align:middle line:90%
there's some commonalities here.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.960 align:middle line:84%
I think the top
three commonalities

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.480 align:middle line:90%
is one that the human.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.010 align:middle line:84%
All of the different
races, where

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:47.780 align:middle line:84%
they're talking about the
Reptilians or a Pleiadian,

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:51.920 align:middle line:84%
or some other extraterrestrial
from some far off, red

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.760 align:middle line:90%
dwarf star system.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.210 align:middle line:90%
They're all interested in us.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.100 align:middle line:90%
We're the common denominator.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.820 align:middle line:90%
They're all coming here.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.500 align:middle line:84%
They're interested
in, of course,

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.750 align:middle line:84%
reproduction for
hybridization program.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.660 align:middle line:84%
But the third thing that
continues to come up

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.070 align:middle line:90%
is psychism.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:13.260 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the experiences are
displaying obvious latent

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:18.330 align:middle line:84%
psychic ability and develop
psychism over the following two

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:22.800 align:middle line:84%
or three weeks after contact,
that high heightened increased

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.480 align:middle line:84%
psychic ability, both sending
and receiving messages.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.970 align:middle line:84%
But just because you hear
a message in your hat,

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.179 align:middle line:84%
and that's offputting
to many people,

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:38.840 align:middle line:84%
does not mean that
it's extraterrestrial.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.909 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're
very grounded this way.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.070 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking
and analyzing,

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.020 align:middle line:84%
you're very clear
to note there are

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.700 align:middle line:90%
some people who are paranoid.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.710 align:middle line:84%
There are some people
who are delusional.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.320 align:middle line:84%
There are some people who've
had actual experiences they

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.910 align:middle line:84%
need to unpack, psychologically
and emotionally.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And you do a good job
of separating those

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.520 align:middle line:84%
out and staying with
what's essential.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Absolutely.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.450 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to
give the experience

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:10.940 align:middle line:84%
or a reasonable understanding
of their experience,

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.690 align:middle line:90%
and not inflating it in any way.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that, we've
now changed the dynamic

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.230 align:middle line:84%
and we're not
dealing with reality.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:25.310 align:middle line:84%
So we want to be as grounded
and as realistic as possible

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.620 align:middle line:84%
so that we can gain
as much information.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.370 align:middle line:84%
It's actually helps me in
doing psychological profiling

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:36.410 align:middle line:84%
of the ETs after we
interview the witness.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:41.870 align:middle line:84%
I'll just make separate columns
to begin writing out behaviors

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:47.430 align:middle line:84%
from the ETs so we can see which
ETs exhibit specific behaviors.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:51.320 align:middle line:84%
So one might know what to
anticipate if they do find

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.720 align:middle line:90%
themselves in that situation.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty likely,
when we look at the numbers.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Now I think the last report said
that the majority of Americans

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.620 align:middle line:84%
do accept the fact that
there are extraterrestrials

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.030 align:middle line:90%
and that they do come to visit.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:08.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and so
let's talk about, you

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.370 align:middle line:84%
said there are a variety
of different beings,

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:11.480 align:middle line:90%
and we know this.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.220 align:middle line:84%
But are you seeing
that there is maybe

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.280 align:middle line:84%
one species that is
showing up a little more

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.112 align:middle line:90%
than the others in your work?

00:10:19.112 --> 00:10:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: OK, so my work
isn't just with abduction,

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.790 align:middle line:90%
but in abduction.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Then it's always a combination
of a Mantis, of a Reptilian--

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and there are multiple forms of
Reptilian-- and 22.2 subspecies

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.370 align:middle line:90%
of Greys, including the Zetas.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And so we see all of them
involved humans as well.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.250 align:middle line:90%
So that draws into my lab.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:47.540 align:middle line:84%
So some humans are sighted
often in abduction.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:52.670 align:middle line:84%
So occurent experiencer, I had
prompted her under regression

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:58.340 align:middle line:84%
to rise above the body
and view the room.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:02.030 align:middle line:84%
She could see four other
beds, tables really,

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:03.450 align:middle line:90%
with other people.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And she realized that they
all came from the same batch.

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.200 align:middle line:90%
Now, the word batch--

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Batch?

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.690 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:16.748 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: The same batch that
there was a batch of created--

00:11:16.748 --> 00:11:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She considered
herself one of them or--

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:19.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: [NODS]

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.567 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And
she felt that they

00:11:21.567 --> 00:11:22.880 align:middle line:90%
were all there for a checkup.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.508 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she
felt she was hybrid.

00:11:24.508 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, hybrid.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.610 align:middle line:84%
But she also felt that the
extraterrestrials involved

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:33.140 align:middle line:84%
were doing something
to limit or restrict

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:38.210 align:middle line:84%
her psychism in sending
and receiving messages

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.565 align:middle line:84%
that human themselves
are natural receivers.

00:11:41.565 --> 00:11:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.815 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: We're
total receivers

00:11:43.815 --> 00:11:45.800 align:middle line:84%
of the job of the
subconscious mind.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.960 align:middle line:90%
It's simply a receiver.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.800 align:middle line:84%
It receives everything outside
of our optical ability,

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.040 align:middle line:84%
trillions of bits of
information flowing and being

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.350 align:middle line:84%
put into the appropriate
compartments based

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:00.170 align:middle line:84%
on the emotional
impact of it, lengthens

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.180 align:middle line:84%
or shortens the
neural pathway for us

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:90%
to access that information.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why would
they be limiting that?

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.490 align:middle line:90%
What did she say?

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, she thinks
that they were suppressing

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.230 align:middle line:84%
that in us because
what will happen

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:16.040 align:middle line:84%
is it'll give us the ability
to communicate without a cell

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:16.930 align:middle line:90%
phone.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
where we're headed.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, sending
and receiving messages

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:24.180 align:middle line:84%
telepathically, distance
shouldn't be a barrier.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And we do have
some evidence that

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:33.230 align:middle line:84%
states all humans, at one
time, were fully telepathic.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.270 align:middle line:90%
We still developed vocal cords.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.500 align:middle line:90%
We still spoke.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.270 align:middle line:90%
We had a spoken language.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:43.280 align:middle line:84%
Right now, there is 7,000
different spoken languages,

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.870 align:middle line:84%
5,000 which have
the written word.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:50.840 align:middle line:84%
So an extraterrestrial can't
simply know 7,000 languages.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:56.300 align:middle line:84%
We've have 5,000 echo planets
that have just recently been

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.320 align:middle line:90%
discovered.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.900 align:middle line:84%
What if they have
5,000 languages?

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.970 align:middle line:84%
This isn't all
about the language.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.220 align:middle line:90%
It's not the words.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.140 align:middle line:90%
It's psychotronics.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.650 align:middle line:84%
It's technology
They're not sending

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:12.350 align:middle line:90%
a psychic message like this.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.810 align:middle line:84%
This is technology,
the same technology

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:16.790 align:middle line:90%
that we are currently using.

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
talk about they're

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.265 align:middle line:90%
using synthetic technology.

00:13:21.265 --> 00:13:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: In
the Pentagon, it's

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.210 align:middle line:84%
common verbiage,
synthetic telepathy.

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:27.440 align:middle line:90%
It's what we use.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.040 align:middle line:84%
It's what they would
use to send a message

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:37.010 align:middle line:84%
to an assassin in a covert
black ops operation.

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:39.770 align:middle line:84%
You can program somebody
with psychotronics.

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:43.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, here's the saddest
thing of all, Regina,

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:48.980 align:middle line:84%
is that psychotronics could
be used to propagate health,

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:54.920 align:middle line:84%
to prompt wellness, and not
only in the mind but in the body

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.730 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.618 align:middle line:84%
Psychotronics has
been weaponized.

00:13:57.618 --> 00:13:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's been weaponized.

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And many people in
this field of endeavor

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.410 align:middle line:90%
have been subject to it.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And you see how powerful
it is and how it almost

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:11.180 align:middle line:84%
feels as though there's
nothing you can do against it.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.110 align:middle line:90%
But you can, you can.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, you can
change your frequency.

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have to
change your frequency.

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And you have to change
your brain frequency.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:17.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Right.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.230 align:middle line:90%
And you can do that--

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.012 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --actually
really easily.

00:14:20.012 --> 00:14:21.557 align:middle line:90%
People should know that.

00:14:21.557 --> 00:14:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, talk about that.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:24.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: You are
able to do that.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Breath, first off, is the
body's frequency modulator.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And just as we all
have-- well, most of us

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.380 align:middle line:84%
have thumbprints,
fingerprints, we also

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.750 align:middle line:84%
have an electromagnetic
signature

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:42.230 align:middle line:84%
that allows them to tune in
to you to drop that message.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Just like words can
change your DNA,

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:48.890 align:middle line:84%
particular thought patterns
can change the frequency

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:50.660 align:middle line:90%
that you're emitting.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Scrambles it a little bit,
makes them a little bit harder

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.300 align:middle line:90%
for them to target or find you.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.820 align:middle line:84%
But there are many
people who are targeted.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, I just want
to add one thing.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:05.630 align:middle line:84%
I think it's also important
to recognize your own higher

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:10.640 align:middle line:84%
mind, your own higher
self, whichever someone's

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.710 align:middle line:84%
comfortable with,
has the ability

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:15.560 align:middle line:84%
to also modulate and shift
those frequencies for you.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, that's right.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All you have to do is
be aware that this is needed.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And you can work
in collaboration

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.918 align:middle line:84%
with yourself as well on all
levels electromagnetically

00:15:22.918 --> 00:15:23.960 align:middle line:90%
and with the higher mind.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: If
you know yourself.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you know
yourself and if you

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.775 align:middle line:84%
know that what's just
occurred is not you.

00:15:28.775 --> 00:15:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:30.650 align:middle line:84%
You have to be able
to differentiate.

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
to be discerning.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Because they can
send a voice into your head.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.500 align:middle line:90%
It can sound slightly robotic.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.530 align:middle line:90%
It can sound beautiful.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.410 align:middle line:84%
It can sound high
pitched, tonal.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:45.330 align:middle line:84%
It can also sound like
your very own voice.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.115 align:middle line:84%
So you must know
yourself because--

00:15:47.115 --> 00:15:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --you get the
feeling, thought causing

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.770 align:middle line:90%
a spiraling of depression.

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:53.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not even real.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.010 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So know your own mind,
know your own thoughts.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:03.293 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that everybody
begins some form of meditation

00:16:03.293 --> 00:16:05.210 align:middle line:84%
because the more you
meditate, the more you're

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:09.320 align:middle line:84%
going to produce a
gamma brainwaves.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Gamma brainwaves are
the higher perception.

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
want to be able to do.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, staying away from other
electronics is helpful.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:20.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's difficult,
like here in Boulder

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:90%
is that 5G is ubiquitous.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: [SIGHS]

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, in this beautiful
mountainous town, your city,

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.240 align:middle line:90%
there's 5G everywhere.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I think
it's easy to imagine

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.740 align:middle line:84%
that this can be utilized
and co-opted to piggyback

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.400 align:middle line:84%
with other types
of signals, too.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, so 5G has been around for
an extraordinarily long time

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:43.610 align:middle line:90%
or decades.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.480 align:middle line:90%
And it's a military application.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.340 align:middle line:90%
It works as a burst of energy.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:51.470 align:middle line:84%
So the energy is shot upwards,
that umbrellas of wave

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:56.065 align:middle line:90%
into about 800-foot radius.

00:16:56.065 --> 00:16:57.440 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
require so many--

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So many of the towers.

00:16:59.210 --> 00:16:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Right.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Because they have
to piggyback off--

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But now, they
built those towers.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.180 align:middle line:90%
It's not just military.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:03.980 align:middle line:90%
Now it's civilian.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.109 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, that's
when it was for military.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:09.029 align:middle line:84%
But so now, what
are we using it for?

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:09.829 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Because people are saying,
hey, I liked my 4G.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:13.700 align:middle line:90%
It worked just great.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we don't seem to
be given a choice in it.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.829 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing towers pop up in
the country where I live.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: They called it 5G
hoping that people would assume

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.770 align:middle line:84%
that that's a
natural progression

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:28.099 align:middle line:90%
from fourth generation to five.

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:29.450 align:middle line:90%
That's not fifth generation.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:31.250 align:middle line:90%
That happened way long ago.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:35.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's just another way to make
it more acceptable to people

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.330 align:middle line:90%
so that they won't resist.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're not usually
informed to begin with,

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.040 align:middle line:90%
so it's just there.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:40.970 align:middle line:90%
It appears there.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:43.580 align:middle line:84%
So OK, now one of the things
you were talking about

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.220 align:middle line:84%
is this when
extraterrestrials, using

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:50.520 align:middle line:84%
this synthetic kind of telepathy
to work with individuals.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just 5G, you're
saying extraterrestrials

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.420 align:middle line:90%
are working with this.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, when you're
getting a psychic message

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:57.370 align:middle line:90%
from--

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.900 align:middle line:84%
that's the other commonality,
one of the top four

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:90%
then is telepathy.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.070 align:middle line:84%
The way they communicate
is telepathic,

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:06.710 align:middle line:90%
but it's not telepathic.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.033 align:middle line:90%
They just feel that it is.

00:18:08.033 --> 00:18:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a projected--

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: It's technology.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --signal into you.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.700 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important to
note to, at this point,

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Laurie, is that this goes
under the area of overly

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:18.530 align:middle line:90%
concerned or paranoia.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:22.040 align:middle line:84%
As many people that are going
into alternative sources

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.620 align:middle line:84%
of information, one of the
first things that happens

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.750 align:middle line:84%
is people become intrigued with
conspiracy theory, for example.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Sure.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:29.633 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's normal.

00:18:29.633 --> 00:18:31.210 align:middle line:84%
It's like, whoa,
I've been lied to,

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:32.960 align:middle line:84%
and you want to go
down every rabbit hole.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Sure.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But people need--
everyone watching this needs

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.230 align:middle line:84%
to understand, there aren't
that many people out there

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle line:84%
that are really of interest
on that specific level.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.040 align:middle line:84%
As you say, there are people
who are involved with black ops

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:46.930 align:middle line:90%
and intelligence.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And these are people
of interest that they

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.820 align:middle line:90%
are going to be targeted.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Your average person
watching this right

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:54.020 align:middle line:84%
now is not going to be
personally targeted.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: No, absolutely no
and until there's a reason.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'd have
to have something

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.730 align:middle line:84%
you're doing of extreme
interest, some kind of profile,

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:03.530 align:middle line:90%
exactly.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yes.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Something-- or, OK, another
alternative possibly is just

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:16.863 align:middle line:84%
a mass change, where if signal
could change everybody's--

00:19:16.863 --> 00:19:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:18.185 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: --perception.

00:19:18.185 --> 00:19:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
different, yeah.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And so that's
the other possibility

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:25.340 align:middle line:84%
because now, they're using
things like holographs

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:29.570 align:middle line:84%
or synthetic optical
vision, where

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:34.430 align:middle line:84%
they can create a
seamless, seamless--

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:38.480 align:middle line:84%
whether you're awake or
asleep, a seamless landscape.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And you'll move from one end
to the other without knowing.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And so that's sort
of virtual reality--

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the
technology is there.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.270 align:middle line:84%
But again, we're
the mighty human.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:53.090 align:middle line:84%
This is the part of the story
that gets lost so often.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:55.400 align:middle line:84%
We, as people, are
staring to the heavens

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.070 align:middle line:84%
and praying for some
command to come and save us.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:02.320 align:middle line:84%
I am not down with those
theories and practices

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.120 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I don't
want anyone to save us.

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just
be straight there.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I'm with you.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:08.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: That's
a huge mistake.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.108 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Huge mistake.

00:20:09.108 --> 00:20:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And that's one
of my concerns, actually,

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:14.010 align:middle line:84%
is when people
appear disempowered--

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --and are
warring with each other,

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:21.920 align:middle line:84%
then we are opening ourselves
up to be taken advantage

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.837 align:middle line:90%
of in a negative way--

00:20:22.837 --> 00:20:23.712 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:20:23.712 --> 00:20:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --from
an extraterrestrial.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're giving them
an open door because we look

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.880 align:middle line:84%
disempowered, when we
can come from a place

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.570 align:middle line:84%
of personal and mass
empowerment, which is healthy.

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And just to clear things, true
personal empowerment really

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:44.930 align:middle line:84%
generates deep feelings
of inner peace,

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:49.010 align:middle line:84%
of self acceptance, the ability
to embrace the true self.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And the true self
is just another way

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:53.025 align:middle line:90%
of saying the spiritual self.

00:20:53.025 --> 00:20:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And we have this
multidimensionality

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.970 align:middle line:84%
that none of these tricks and
tricksters are addressing.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:02.820 align:middle line:84%
So we have to stay in
that vertical alignment

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:90%
with ourselves.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:04.850 align:middle line:90%
It's so important.

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:06.170 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree with you more.

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.540 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's coming to save
us, and don't ask them to.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And no,
we don't want them to.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do not want that.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: If we
can't save ourselves

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:14.810 align:middle line:84%
and then we need
another kick at the can

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:19.310 align:middle line:84%
here and to try to come about
it from a different perspective.

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:23.030 align:middle line:84%
It is up to us ultimately
to save ourselves.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:25.640 align:middle line:90%
That's just being a good parent.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.830 align:middle line:84%
A good parent is you know
you're done parenting

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:32.270 align:middle line:84%
when your child no longer needs
you, then you did your job.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.390 align:middle line:90%
Now, they just want you.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.682 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: But that
need, that changes things.

00:21:36.682 --> 00:21:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it does.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.393 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's go back to
some of the anomalies you're

00:21:40.393 --> 00:21:42.560 align:middle line:84%
seeing because I-- one of
them we were talking about

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:48.225 align:middle line:84%
was a dome, a projected like
holographic dome, and UFO.

00:21:48.225 --> 00:21:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what's being projected

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:51.410 align:middle line:84%
that you're hearing through
some of these people.

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:53.630 align:middle line:84%
So we kind of know what
kind of tricks are up.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:54.950 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: OK, so there's--

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:57.500 align:middle line:10%
had several people
tell me this year

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:01.670 align:middle line:10%
that prior to contact
and abduction,

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:07.280 align:middle line:10%
they saw like a
green grid dome shape

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.250 align:middle line:10%
over their house and area.

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was as if they
were being shut off

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:17.060 align:middle line:84%
from anybody else being
able to see or hear

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.410 align:middle line:90%
or to be involved in any way.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, the first
time I heard it, I

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:26.530 align:middle line:90%
contemplated what that could be.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.930 align:middle line:90%
And then I heard it again.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.790 align:middle line:90%
And then I've heard it again.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:33.160 align:middle line:90%
And I'm hearing it still.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.990 align:middle line:84%
There's some strange
green grid, a grid pattern

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:42.010 align:middle line:84%
that seems like a dome
that takes over areas.

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And underneath that, this is
where the extraterrestrials

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:50.948 align:middle line:84%
are just walking and free
to show themselves and do

00:22:50.948 --> 00:22:52.990 align:middle line:84%
whatever they want to do
with people that they're

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.350 align:middle line:90%
engaging with.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Almost
kind of a shielding?

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: It's a shielding.

00:22:55.810 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And it first appears in
this green, alien green--

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:03.090 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] like a
laser green grid.

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's
interesting, years ago,

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:09.580 align:middle line:84%
as I was coming to consciousness
and I kind of rolled out

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:13.220 align:middle line:84%
of my body a little bit, I
rolled out onto a green grid.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Really?

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:19.370 align:middle line:84%
A green laser, laser lines
of that almost phosphorescent

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:20.170 align:middle line:90%
bright green--

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: That's the one.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --grid.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:27.880 align:middle line:84%
But you know what I saw, is it
was a grid-- the grid actually

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:32.380 align:middle line:84%
contained at the vector points
is where all information was

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:90%
programmed.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Wow.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All these grids
with massive amounts of vector

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.670 align:middle line:84%
points and massive
amounts of information

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:43.900 align:middle line:84%
as if it was holding the
memory of every sentient thing

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.375 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:23:45.375 --> 00:23:47.500 align:middle line:84%
I didn't find it remotely
intimidating or anything.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.490 align:middle line:90%
I was fascinated by it.

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:51.202 align:middle line:90%
So that's how I saw that grid.

00:23:51.202 --> 00:23:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, that doesn't mean it's
necessarily the same grid

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:54.618 align:middle line:90%
that these people are seeing.

00:23:54.618 --> 00:23:56.660 align:middle line:84%
It may be something else
that's been constructed.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I saw the
grid once as well.

00:23:58.330 --> 00:23:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: [LAUGHING]
Recovering from some

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:04.570 align:middle line:90%
of the surgery I've had.

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And rolled out of my body
because I was in so much pain.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm allergic to
all pain medication.

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:16.055 align:middle line:84%
I'm allergic to
antibiotics and--

00:24:16.055 --> 00:24:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just got to
suffer through it, girl, right?

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:20.138 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I suffer
right on through it.

00:24:20.138 --> 00:24:22.450 align:middle line:84%
So elevated myself
a bit out of my body

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:27.550 align:middle line:84%
to not feel the pain so
much and rose so quick,

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:34.133 align:middle line:84%
I actually hit the grid and
saw it and couldn't pass it.

00:24:34.133 --> 00:24:35.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I couldn't
move past the grid.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And then I came back
down into my body.

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.010 align:middle line:90%
I didn't try to go through it.

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:43.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: I did.

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just fascinated
at watching its function

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.390 align:middle line:84%
in these huge
balls of light that

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.310 align:middle line:84%
lit up at every
vector point filled

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:52.897 align:middle line:90%
with all this information.

00:24:52.897 --> 00:24:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well,
everything is information.

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and it
was just showing-- it

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.350 align:middle line:84%
was a storage
system, that was all.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:02.410 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't try to do
anything with it, where you--

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: So we
can access this.

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I saw, is it's all--

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:09.140 align:middle line:84%
everything that's ever been is
accessible, it's right there.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Now, and
extraterrestrials--

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:15.640 align:middle line:84%
and again, just entities
that live off planet,

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.180 align:middle line:84%
nothing special, maybe
older, maybe more technically

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:24.850 align:middle line:84%
advanced, just to some sentient,
some AI, just different,

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:25.900 align:middle line:90%
they do come.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they are
using that grid.

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe they are
for their own purposes

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:35.450 align:middle line:84%
but also using human DNA for
their own purposes, which--

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:36.250 align:middle line:90%
hey.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:38.333 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, well, I
don't believe that word,

00:25:38.333 --> 00:25:42.130 align:middle line:84%
our DNA is going to
propagate the health

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:44.410 align:middle line:84%
of an extraterrestrial
race when they've already

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:46.150 align:middle line:90%
got advanced technology.

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Some of their own citizens are
part AI, like the small Greys.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:56.320 align:middle line:84%
The taller Greys is
more sentient entity.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.060 align:middle line:90%
The shorter ones are programmed.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.520 align:middle line:84%
They've got a set
amount of duties

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.620 align:middle line:84%
that they're capable
of performing.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:07.120 align:middle line:84%
They have limited free thinking
because they're hive minded.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.195 align:middle line:90%
But now, they're created--

00:26:09.195 --> 00:26:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
other entities,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.090 align:middle line:84%
other types of
entities, not the Greys,

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:14.650 align:middle line:84%
that maybe would
like a little bit

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:17.680 align:middle line:84%
of the incredible
power of creativity

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.240 align:middle line:90%
in spirit that the human has?

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Not theirs.

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.740 align:middle line:84%
So the human-- and we've
discussed this before--

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.890 align:middle line:84%
the definition of what
we are is in the name.

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Hue, the light is how we
measure the depth or saturation

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:32.140 align:middle line:90%
of specific lights.

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:33.910 align:middle line:90%
We measure that in hues.

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Man coming from the
word manifestation,

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:40.480 align:middle line:84%
to come into the physical
or to be embodied.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Human, light and body
being, race and gender

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.180 align:middle line:90%
are subcategories of that.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And so that's also about
knowing what you are.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.240 align:middle line:84%
When you know what
you are, you're

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:57.250 align:middle line:84%
able to see those larger
answers to those philosophical

00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:00.850 align:middle line:84%
questions that we've pondered
for hundreds of years.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:02.740 align:middle line:84%
They're not that
difficult anymore

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.870 align:middle line:90%
when you know what you are.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And so part of the
hybridization program,

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:10.540 align:middle line:84%
I've always believed
was they're creating

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:14.110 align:middle line:84%
a hybrid that will have a soul,
that light, which they do not

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:17.470 align:middle line:84%
have, so they can
hijack our ascension.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Our ascension is the
chronological order

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:23.403 align:middle line:90%
of rising in awareness.

00:27:23.403 --> 00:27:24.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
did an interview

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.200 align:middle line:84%
with former Archdeacon
of the Anglican church,

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Paul Wallis, out
of Australia, who

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:32.500 align:middle line:84%
deals with a lot with
the subject of UFOs,

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.900 align:middle line:90%
of abductees and such.

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.400 align:middle line:90%
And Fr.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Sean O'Laoire, both
of them, talking

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:41.210 align:middle line:84%
about the uniqueness
of the human being

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and going back, historically,
about the attempt

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.980 align:middle line:84%
to suppress the
magnificence of what we are

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:50.870 align:middle line:84%
and what we're capable of on a
mental, psycho-spiritual level.

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:51.670 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Started
at the tower of Babel.

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:55.383 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's why I
was going to bring that up.

00:27:55.383 --> 00:27:56.350 align:middle line:90%
So you go ahead.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And they talked about it
in their own parlance.

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And you speak about it
the way you understand it.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: I
understand it this way,

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:07.900 align:middle line:84%
that all humans, no
matter what tribe or what

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.570 align:middle line:84%
corner of the
planet they were on,

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:15.460 align:middle line:84%
were able to communicate with
each other without speaking.

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Still today, up to
95% of communication

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:21.220 align:middle line:90%
is still nonverbal.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:25.150 align:middle line:84%
People don't realize that,
but its body language

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:29.500 align:middle line:84%
and other nuances that
communicate our messages far

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.570 align:middle line:90%
clearer than our words.

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:34.290 align:middle line:90%
So it was the Anunnaki.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:38.670 align:middle line:84%
After the Big Flood, the
people came together--

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The most
recent big flood.

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, in Shinar.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.430 align:middle line:90%
And they built a beautiful city.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And they started to build
a tower towards heaven,

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.420 align:middle line:90%
towards the gods.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:54.330 align:middle line:84%
The gods, the Anunnaki, saw
this and were concerned.

00:28:54.330 --> 00:29:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And they suppressed the
people and sent them

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.940 align:middle line:84%
in multiple directions
to relearn language.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:06.540 align:middle line:84%
They feared us because
we were working together.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And when we were
working together,

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.100 align:middle line:90%
we were creating advancement.

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.230 align:middle line:90%
And we were good.

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And it was they who sent us
spiraling backwards in time

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:21.090 align:middle line:90%
by having to relearn this.

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:25.860 align:middle line:84%
But the universe is in a
constant state of flux,

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.650 align:middle line:84%
and it's in a constant
state of expansion.

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And in the cosmology
of the universe

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:38.740 align:middle line:84%
and where our planet Earth is,
by the year 2040, maybe 2050,

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:42.820 align:middle line:84%
the humans will be receiving a
very specific cosmic wave that

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:46.840 align:middle line:84%
will allow the dissolving of
the sheath over the pineal gland

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.520 align:middle line:84%
and will bring us back to that
time where we communicated,

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.900 align:middle line:90%
sending and receiving messages.

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And at this time, we should
expect some huge changes

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.260 align:middle line:84%
on the planet as
the population is

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.380 align:middle line:84%
getting closer to that
10 billion mark by then.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And every time the
population of the Earth

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:09.080 align:middle line:84%
has gotten to 10 billion, it
creates a quanta of energy.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a natural evolutionary
step for humanity.

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:18.210 align:middle line:84%
In the age of confluence, we'll
have some decisions to make.

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:21.570 align:middle line:84%
I believe we'll make
them correctly this time.

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
interesting because we're

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.800 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about
Elon Musk in a bit

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:29.740 align:middle line:84%
here, in an amidst all of
this, with AI and everything.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.520 align:middle line:84%
One of the things he was
saying in a recent talk

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.940 align:middle line:84%
was that we're approaching
population collapse.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is really interesting
because the replacement

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:45.460 align:middle line:84%
population, certainly in the
Western world, is not in place.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.690 align:middle line:84%
We don't have adequate
population replacement

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:50.460 align:middle line:90%
at this moment in time.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And depending on what else
has happened in our abilities

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:55.380 align:middle line:84%
to procreate with all
of the stuff around us,

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:59.340 align:middle line:84%
it could be that at least, in
large portions of the world

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:00.960 align:middle line:84%
are going into
reduced population

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.610 align:middle line:84%
rather than
increased population.

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Well--

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Could
that be something--

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --it
should be increasing.

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.765 align:middle line:84%
But should that be-- could that
be by any design of some kind?

00:31:07.765 --> 00:31:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Oh, absolutely.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:11.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHING] I'm
saying that for a reason.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yes, OK.

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:12.480 align:middle line:90%
I got you.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.410 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:14.340 align:middle line:90%
Took a second, no.

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:18.390 align:middle line:84%
No, they've been on
a depopulation agenda

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:19.980 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're fearing
that 10 billion

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.610 align:middle line:84%
mark because we
will surprise them.

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be right
back to that time where

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.370 align:middle line:90%
we were able to do that.

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, we'll
be able to do it

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.372 align:middle line:84%
with the utmost respect
for one another.

00:31:35.372 --> 00:31:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With a
different consciousness.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: With a
different consciousness.

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Than how we arrived
at this point in time.

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:40.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Right.

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:42.850 align:middle line:90%
And consciousness is everything.

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:44.040 align:middle line:90%
It's key here.

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.980 align:middle line:84%
It is all about our
ability to elevate

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:51.270 align:middle line:84%
that in a way that allows
everybody to participate.

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:55.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that the world
is grossly overpopulated.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:58.870 align:middle line:84%
I think that that's
the complete opposite.

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:03.640 align:middle line:84%
I think that we have room
for many more people,

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.120 align:middle line:84%
and we have the
ability to provide

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.450 align:middle line:90%
for all of these people.

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:11.040 align:middle line:84%
We always have had the ability
to provide for the people.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:14.005 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of
equal distribution--

00:32:14.005 --> 00:32:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --and utilizing
the technology that will allow.

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:22.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, doesn't Colorado have
one of the world's largest

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.237 align:middle line:90%
vertical indoor farms?

00:32:25.237 --> 00:32:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
I don't live here.

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:27.390 align:middle line:90%
It may.

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:28.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:29.877 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, I
think they're called

00:32:29.877 --> 00:32:31.210 align:middle line:90%
"Karela" or something to that.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:32.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And so we do
have technology available.

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: BlackRock and Vanguard
are the biggest investors

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.260 align:middle line:84%
in this vertical
farming, by the way.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Vertical
farming is--

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.720 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And even outside,
old-fashioned farming,

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.530 align:middle line:84%
we have the ability to
create desalinization plants

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:51.330 align:middle line:90%
in plenty.

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: We don't
have a water shortage.

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:54.825 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:32:54.825 --> 00:32:56.367 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: You know
what the air is?

00:32:56.367 --> 00:32:57.390 align:middle line:90%
It's water.

00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We do not
have-- we do not have

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:00.720 align:middle line:90%
a water shortage on the planet.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.180 align:middle line:84%
We can, in certain
locales, where populations

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:06.210 align:middle line:84%
have sprung up where there
isn't an obvious water

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:07.480 align:middle line:90%
source, for example.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:11.010 align:middle line:84%
But other than that, in terms of
the majority of the populations

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:13.860 align:middle line:84%
living along the coasts
of the various continents,

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.330 align:middle line:84%
there's more-- the
technology is already there.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:19.650 align:middle line:84%
It's just not being utilized,
just for desalinization.

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:21.900 align:middle line:90%
You and I are on the same page.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.700 align:middle line:84%
A woman named Lorraine
Day was showing

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:27.780 align:middle line:84%
me kind of the math on that at
one point about the land mass

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:31.030 align:middle line:84%
that every person in the
planet could fit in and still

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:31.830 align:middle line:90%
live healthfully.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was a relatively
small land mass.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.190 align:middle line:90%
This is a massive planet.

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And so many beautiful
technologies, either

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:41.670 align:middle line:84%
are already been created or
on the verge of being created,

00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:46.200 align:middle line:84%
that allow us everything we need
to thrive, not just to survive.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And so it's interesting
that I bring it up

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.132 align:middle line:84%
because this 10 billion
number has come up

00:33:51.132 --> 00:33:52.090 align:middle line:90%
in other conversations.

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Right.

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, the 10 billion
is very important.

00:33:54.510 --> 00:34:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're estimated to arrive
at that between 2040 and 2050.

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:01.620 align:middle line:90%
So people, do your part.

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.122 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:34:03.122 --> 00:34:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do your part.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.772 align:middle line:84%
And enjoy yourselves
while you're at it, OK?

00:34:06.772 --> 00:34:08.730 align:middle line:84%
So I want to get to a
couple of other things we

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:11.610 align:middle line:84%
talked about, is a lot of times,
when people have ET contact,

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:14.520 align:middle line:84%
they start having A, more
paranormal experience.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:17.429 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people feel,
like I said in the tease

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:20.429 align:middle line:84%
when I brought you
in, that it's almost

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:21.780 align:middle line:90%
like a spiritual awakening.

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.400 align:middle line:84%
Can you speak to
that for a moment?

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.983 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: OK, I
think that it should

00:34:24.983 --> 00:34:26.980 align:middle line:90%
be a spiritual awakening.

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:31.590 align:middle line:84%
So I deal with people who have
paranormal and extraterrestrial

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:32.429 align:middle line:90%
activity.

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, a person who has
extraterrestrial activity,

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:37.530 align:middle line:84%
abduction, contact,
downloads, whatever

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:42.960 align:middle line:84%
it happens to be, they do grow
into an expanded consciousness.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.730 align:middle line:90%
The reality is challenged.

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:47.460 align:middle line:90%
And they grow into that.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:51.179 align:middle line:84%
And they become empowered
in a gentle way.

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, people who may
have a paranormal one,

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:58.290 align:middle line:84%
I find that where they
run to is religion.

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And now, they're capped into
a good and evil paradigm,

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:07.830 align:middle line:84%
conceptualized thoughts
that we created.

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And they don't become
awakened, or they

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:15.720 align:middle line:84%
don't become spiritually
conscious of what

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.070 align:middle line:90%
might be their next step.

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:21.780 align:middle line:84%
So many people, who've gone
through the empowerment

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:25.020 align:middle line:84%
process, they
begin to understand

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:29.790 align:middle line:84%
that it is all spiritual
because their soul has

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:33.720 align:middle line:84%
been either sucked out of their
body by some extraterrestrial.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:34.650 align:middle line:90%
And we do see that.

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:37.170 align:middle line:84%
It's not just them
dropping information

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:40.080 align:middle line:84%
into their consciousness, it's
them taking our consciousness

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and moving it elsewhere
and the body being left.

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:48.090 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty scary for people.

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:49.710 align:middle line:84%
But for the longest
time, though, they

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:51.127 align:middle line:84%
think they're still
in their body.

00:35:51.127 --> 00:35:53.880 align:middle line:84%
That takes a little
bit to figure it out.

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:57.010 align:middle line:84%
But once they realize
that outside of the body,

00:35:57.010 --> 00:36:01.270 align:middle line:84%
they still maintain a
personality, identity,

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:04.320 align:middle line:84%
so on and so forth,
then they begin

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:08.170 align:middle line:84%
to see that their existence
here on the planet

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:11.950 align:middle line:84%
might be something altogether
different than what they were

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:14.740 align:middle line:84%
led to believe, that maybe
now, they're beginning

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.890 align:middle line:84%
to see that they are
embodied, they're

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:19.900 align:middle line:90%
in a third-dimensional reality.

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And in this third-dimensional
dualistic reality,

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:26.620 align:middle line:84%
we have an opportunity
to grow, to learn.

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, there are
two things to master.

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:33.400 align:middle line:84%
One is love, and
the other is fear.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And when we understand the
dualistic nature of both

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.490 align:middle line:84%
of those things,
we're accelerating

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:42.650 align:middle line:84%
our spiritual understanding,
and we're moving.

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:48.875 align:middle line:84%
But with fear, it can trap
you into a paralyzed state.

00:36:48.875 --> 00:36:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Or
you're a fear monger,

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and you're creating
that state in others.

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Love, I see people are
very good at giving.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.240 align:middle line:84%
They can love, love,
love, love, love.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:04.000 align:middle line:84%
But then when it
comes to receiving,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.380 align:middle line:84%
they're not completely
open or vulnerable enough

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:09.663 align:middle line:90%
to receive it.

00:37:09.663 --> 00:37:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot
of it, dating back

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.600 align:middle line:84%
to some of these early messages
that have been propagated

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.640 align:middle line:84%
throughout the last
several thousand years

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:19.870 align:middle line:84%
of being less than whoever these
gods were that came to, quote,

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:20.840 align:middle line:90%
save humanity.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Right.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:22.960 align:middle line:90%
It was verbiage, too.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:27.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't know that
initially the word "god" meant

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:30.940 align:middle line:84%
what we interpret it to
be because we recently

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:35.230 align:middle line:84%
learned that the word "worship"
meant originally, "work for."

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:38.350 align:middle line:90%
So you worked for a god.

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:40.730 align:middle line:90%
We now use the word "worship."

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And so when we get to
understand original definitions

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:48.970 align:middle line:84%
and verbiage, we see that
there's a completely different

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:50.050 align:middle line:90%
direction.

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as you
were speaking before,

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:56.650 align:middle line:84%
there are some experiences
where people are taken by ETs,

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:58.575 align:middle line:84%
and they feel they've
been capped almost.

00:37:58.575 --> 00:37:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And there are
others where people

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:01.490 align:middle line:90%
feel they have been expanded.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:03.280 align:middle line:84%
So I'm wondering
if there might not

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.700 align:middle line:84%
be a conscience happening
also in the interplay

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:09.760 align:middle line:84%
with the human species because
we're so vulnerable, because we

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.970 align:middle line:84%
simply have amnesia, not
because we lack capability.

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And so those who have come
for whatever their purpose is,

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:20.420 align:middle line:84%
to watch, to snag a little
DNA, to help, to not help,

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.150 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
competing agendas

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:24.610 align:middle line:84%
on how they interface
with humanity, too.

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:26.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: There are
many competing agendas.

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:28.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: But some of
the extraterrestrials

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.165 align:middle line:90%
are becoming bolder.

00:38:31.165 --> 00:38:33.960 align:middle line:90%


00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Mass extraterrestrial
contact is a game changer.

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:41.860 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it will change religion.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.720 align:middle line:90%
It will change politics.

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:46.310 align:middle line:90%
And it will change technology.

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And it will open the door to
artificial intelligence in ways

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:54.910 align:middle line:90%
that we can't quite fathom yet.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.710 align:middle line:84%
But they are very
advanced in that area.

00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, until
then, we have Elon Musk,

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:02.005 align:middle line:84%
who most people think
is an ET anyway--

00:39:02.005 --> 00:39:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Well, he could be.

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:03.422 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --of some kind.

00:39:03.422 --> 00:39:04.300 align:middle line:90%
And he could be.

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Partly, we all
have extraterrestrial DNA.

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:07.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do.

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:09.880 align:middle line:84%
But I bring him up
for a reason because I

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:14.170 align:middle line:84%
find it absolutely fascinating
that this interesting person,

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:16.010 align:middle line:84%
who says they're on
the spectrum, right?

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Has been able
to single-handedly force,

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:22.060 align:middle line:84%
for example, the
transportation industry

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:24.610 align:middle line:84%
to move up its agenda
by 10 or 20 years,

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:27.430 align:middle line:84%
moving toward a cleaner
type of vehicle.

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:29.630 align:middle line:90%
And that's just one thing.

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:32.770 align:middle line:84%
But the big one and
it's interesting to me,

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:38.500 align:middle line:84%
that people, politically, on
the neo versions, the neocons

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.470 align:middle line:84%
and neoliberals, the extremes
of the left and right

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:43.900 align:middle line:84%
hate this man with
such a passion.

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Well, they fear him.

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And fear
turns into what's hate.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.680 align:middle line:84%
All of the media
trashes him, all sides.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So I look at that and say, I'm
going to pay closer attention

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:53.013 align:middle line:90%
to what he's saying.

00:39:53.013 --> 00:39:54.610 align:middle line:84%
He has to be doing
something right

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:55.480 align:middle line:90%
if they're so afraid of him.

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, I'm
not a hater of Elon Musk.

00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:58.573 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm not a hater.

00:39:58.573 --> 00:39:59.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm a big supporter personally.

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:02.560 align:middle line:84%
But this is the part I want
to get to just to wrap up

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:03.610 align:middle line:90%
our conversation.

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:06.760 align:middle line:84%
The big fear is
beyond ETs, which

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:10.150 align:middle line:84%
are involved, I understand,
is the notion of AI

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:13.210 align:middle line:84%
and the interface with the
human brain and transhumanism.

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And so recently, in this
talk, I was sharing with you

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:20.110 align:middle line:84%
a moment ago, with
the founder of TEDx,

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:22.750 align:middle line:84%
they started questioning
him on the neural link,

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:25.960 align:middle line:84%
because all of the
media says this man is

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.370 align:middle line:90%
promoting transhumanism.

00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:29.440 align:middle line:84%
But no one's listening
to the words.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And what I thought
was interesting,

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.090 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to have
to start contemplating this,

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:37.180 align:middle line:84%
he was saying this little disk,
which for the next decade,

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.150 align:middle line:84%
will continue to be used
only for spinal cord injury

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:41.800 align:middle line:90%
and brain trauma.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.930 align:middle line:90%
That's all it's being used for.

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:47.470 align:middle line:84%
As they develop it,
what the idea is to help

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:50.530 align:middle line:84%
enhance cognitive functioning
and memory in humans

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:53.200 align:middle line:84%
if they wish to do this, by
inserting this little thing.

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's got little
filaments that go and work

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:56.110 align:middle line:90%
with the brain.

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: I've seen it.

00:40:57.190 --> 00:41:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But he's saying
it's already happening.

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:05.320 align:middle line:84%
We have a choice, either we are
going to be the gods of the AI

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:08.680 align:middle line:84%
we interface with, or it's
going to be the god over us.

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want
something running us,

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:13.900 align:middle line:84%
artificial intelligence
running us.

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And his position, the
Neuralink is actually

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:20.240 align:middle line:84%
a preemptive move in the area
of AI, which is fascinating.

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: His first prototype
for the Neuralink actually

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:26.080 align:middle line:90%
had an earpiece.

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And so it kind of
looked cyborg in a way.

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And so that might
have startled people.

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.802 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this
is not less creepy.

00:41:32.802 --> 00:41:34.885 align:middle line:84%
It's a little quarter-sized
thing you put inside--

00:41:34.885 --> 00:41:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah, but--

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --get a
little bit skull out.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --it fits
within the thickness--

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:39.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it does.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: --of our skull.

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And so there'll
only be like a small scar.

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.610 align:middle line:84%
It'll still have to be
charged every night.

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:48.490 align:middle line:84%
You'll have to charge it to
make sure that you can use it.

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:51.490 align:middle line:84%
But right now, the
idea of the Neuralink

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:53.680 align:middle line:84%
is to primarily
help people who have

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.547 align:middle line:84%
been victims of car accidents
and are now paralyzed.

00:41:56.547 --> 00:41:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's all trauma based.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.088 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: All trauma based.

00:41:59.088 --> 00:42:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Spinal cord
and brain trauma.

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And he said it's going to
be just that for at least 10

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:04.490 align:middle line:90%
more years.

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: And the problem is--

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and this is the majority
of the people's concern--

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:15.820 align:middle line:84%
is that that can be corrupted
and programmed from a distance

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.450 align:middle line:84%
to send whatever message
is that the people

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:20.920 align:middle line:90%
are going to receive.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're going to be
coming from a central source.

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's their fear.

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: That's their fear.

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's their fear.

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:28.000 align:middle line:90%
He's specifically saying--

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, there was
a fear with electric cars,

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:32.980 align:middle line:84%
too, that they could take them
over and crash them for you.

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:34.810 align:middle line:90%
OK, so there's always fear.

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:37.867 align:middle line:84%
But we need to learn how
to move through the fear.

00:42:37.867 --> 00:42:39.617 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's why
I'm bringing this up.

00:42:39.617 --> 00:42:40.750 align:middle line:90%
This is now subject.

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:44.290 align:middle line:84%
You got your artificial
communication,

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:46.120 align:middle line:84%
synthetic
communication from ETs.

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.530 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's other species.

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:48.460 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's us.

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:49.465 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's this species--

00:42:49.465 --> 00:42:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: That's right.

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:51.133 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --creating this.

00:42:51.133 --> 00:42:53.350 align:middle line:90%
And that, we have a choice over.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And we have to start making
intelligent decisions

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:57.610 align:middle line:90%
and listen to what's intended.

00:42:57.610 --> 00:42:59.920 align:middle line:84%
He's the first one
to say, there's

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:03.550 align:middle line:84%
no doubt this could have
strange implications.

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:04.880 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And so they have to continue
managing it in any way

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:12.010 align:middle line:84%
they can, while the
others are managing it

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:14.540 align:middle line:84%
in the way they wish, which
I'm not happy about at all.

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:15.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm totally with them on that.

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Can you
imagine, though,

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:21.460 align:middle line:84%
the Neuralink being hooked
up to a quantum computer?

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:26.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a quantum computer,
100,000 times faster

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.170 align:middle line:90%
than your best laptop.

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
what he said, is ideally,

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:31.270 align:middle line:84%
if it were to develop
all the way out,

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:33.280 align:middle line:84%
your computational
skills would increase,

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.847 align:middle line:90%
memory would increase.

00:43:34.847 --> 00:43:36.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: You would
have facilities.

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:38.388 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'd have the
internet in your head.

00:43:38.388 --> 00:43:39.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
I want that yet.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:40.600 align:middle line:90%
But [LAUGHS]

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well,
again, it's accessing.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.202 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's accessing.

00:43:43.202 --> 00:43:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: So it's there.

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:46.157 align:middle line:90%
And you could be going--

00:43:46.157 --> 00:43:47.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
have choice over it.

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:49.540 align:middle line:84%
It's when you don't
have choice and you're

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:51.603 align:middle line:84%
being exposed to it
really against your will.

00:43:51.603 --> 00:43:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And so you don't
want to use it anymore,

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:54.730 align:middle line:90%
don't charge it.

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And
they can be removed.

00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:59.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They can,
but I'm talking

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:02.235 align:middle line:84%
about the other kinds of AI
that are coming in right now,

00:44:02.235 --> 00:44:03.910 align:middle line:90%
that I don't feel good about.

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: Well, the new
artificial intelligence,

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:10.205 align:middle line:84%
there are risks of
it becoming corrupt--

00:44:10.205 --> 00:44:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --and
politicians using it.

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:14.810 align:middle line:90%
But it's here.

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: It is.

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Psychotronics
are already here.

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:19.730 align:middle line:84%
Holographic technology
is already here.

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:21.460 align:middle line:84%
So now, we have
to gain the wisdom

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:24.280 align:middle line:84%
to say, how do we choose
to interface with this,

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately,
whether or not we

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:30.220 align:middle line:84%
want to use anything beyond
our own organic self and brain.

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Those are going to be
our choices, though.

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:32.770 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:33.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, I think that--

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I hope.

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: --we can't stop the
natural progression of science.

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We cannot.

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:42.250 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: But what
we can do is monitor it

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:46.090 align:middle line:84%
from a place of
balanced perspective.

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And just because we can, doesn't
mean that we always should.

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:54.130 align:middle line:84%
So we have to look at certain
technologies and think,

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:56.060 align:middle line:90%
should we advance in this area?

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.370 align:middle line:90%
What are the ramifications?

00:44:57.370 --> 00:44:58.630 align:middle line:90%
What are the consequences?

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:02.260 align:middle line:84%
What can we project the outcome
of this in 10, 20, or 30 years?

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.218 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not let it
usurp our sovereignty,

00:45:04.218 --> 00:45:06.468 align:middle line:84%
our sovereignty of spirit
and our sovereignty of mind.

00:45:06.468 --> 00:45:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MCDONALD: And so what
happens to our spirituality

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:12.430 align:middle line:84%
when god becomes your--
the internet is god.

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and this
brings up a whole conversation

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:17.770 align:middle line:84%
for later on because a
lot of these species that

00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:19.903 align:middle line:84%
are interfacing with
humanity have already

00:45:19.903 --> 00:45:22.570 align:middle line:84%
been at these critical junctures
and had to make these decisions

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:23.370 align:middle line:90%
for themselves.

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:25.120 align:middle line:84%
We need to learn
from that as well.

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.287 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Well, they have.

00:45:26.287 --> 00:45:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's the
primary message that comes back

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:32.890 align:middle line:84%
from people who received
downloads and even people who

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:35.650 align:middle line:84%
channel extraterrestrials,
as always,

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:38.380 align:middle line:84%
the health of our
planet, overpopulation,

00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:39.430 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:43.060 align:middle line:84%
That message hasn't
changed since Tuella

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:46.660 align:middle line:84%
in 1947, who started
channeling Ashtar

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:48.580 align:middle line:90%
from the Galactic Federation.

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:51.160 align:middle line:90%
So the messages haven't changed.

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:54.640 align:middle line:84%
I find that slightly suspect,
to be honest with you.

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:56.558 align:middle line:84%
I would think that the
messages should change.

00:45:56.558 --> 00:45:57.850 align:middle line:90%
What is it, the same recording?

00:45:57.850 --> 00:45:58.650 align:middle line:90%
They're just like--

00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] Right.

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:04.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's up to us to know
ourselves, to know thyself,

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.060 align:middle line:84%
to know your own mind,
to know your own spirit,

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:09.720 align:middle line:84%
and to understand our
incredible human capabilities.

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Right.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:14.757 align:middle line:10%
Because the truth is I believe
that humans are incredible.

00:46:14.757 --> 00:46:15.590 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I do, too.

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:19.370 align:middle line:10%
>>MCDONALD: Highly creative,
beautiful, loving, fun people.

00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:23.720 align:middle line:10%
And we have a right to learn
how to save ourselves and grow

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:26.797 align:middle line:10%
through this very
interesting time in history.

00:46:26.797 --> 00:46:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I couldn't agree more.

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:32.127 align:middle line:84%
So we'll have you back on
probably same time next year.

00:46:32.127 --> 00:46:32.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Perfect.

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thanks
so much, Laurie.

00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>>MCDONALD: Thank you.
