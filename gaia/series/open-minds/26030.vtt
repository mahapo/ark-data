00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:19.400 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Many of us have

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.140 align:middle line:10%
wondered why, if
extraterrestrial life is real,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.290 align:middle line:10%
we don't hear about it.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.680 align:middle line:10%
More so, why don't
they show themselves?

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.720 align:middle line:10%
As it turns out, there
are very complex reasons

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.430 align:middle line:10%
behind both of those answers.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.420 align:middle line:10%
Richard Dolan has
devoted his skills

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.040 align:middle line:10%
as a historian and journalist
to understanding those questions

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.740 align:middle line:10%
and has gone a step further.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.340 align:middle line:84%
In his book "A.D.
After Disclosure,"

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.990 align:middle line:84%
he weaves a likely
future scenario of ET

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.410 align:middle line:84%
contact together
with historical fact.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.440 align:middle line:84%
The outcome is an
extremely thought

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.600 align:middle line:84%
provoking look at the powers
that be both above and below.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.350 align:middle line:84%
I say that somewhat
metaphorically

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.540 align:middle line:84%
since we tend to think
of ETs as out there.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.530 align:middle line:84%
But you have done an excellent
job putting it all together.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose my first question
would be-- you are a historian.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.620 align:middle line:84%
You know everything
about the presidents

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.900 align:middle line:84%
of the United States
and other individuals.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.040 align:middle line:84%
How did you decide
to take on the notion

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.905 align:middle line:84%
of the history of
UFOs and ET contact?

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:13.780 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD DOLAN: Yes.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all,
thank you for having me

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.880 align:middle line:90%
on this show, Regina.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Most welcome.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: It's a real pleasure.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: My pleasure.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Many years ago,
I was working on a Ph.D.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.540 align:middle line:10%
in United States
Cold War history.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.150 align:middle line:10%
Basically, Harry Truman's
national security strategy

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.590 align:middle line:10%
circa 1950.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.520 align:middle line:10%
And that was my life.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.050 align:middle line:10%
That was where my head was at.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.460 align:middle line:10%
Nothing to do with UFOs.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.410 align:middle line:10%
Nothing to do with
flying saucers.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.930 align:middle line:10%
But in the early 1990s,
I truly became hooked.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:10%
I would say obsessed would be
a better way to describe it.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was simply by
browsing through a bookstore,

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.164 align:middle line:84%
seeing one particular book
called "Above Top Secret."

00:01:47.164 --> 00:01:48.830 align:middle line:84%
It was the subtitle
that got me, though.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.220 align:middle line:90%
"The Worldwide UFO Cover-Up."

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.730 align:middle line:84%
By the author Timothy Good, with
whom I'm very good friends now.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.740 align:middle line:84%
But at the time, I knew
nothing about UFOs.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.960 align:middle line:90%
I was quite intrigued.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And I remember browsing through
the book, recognizing names.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Names that I had studied
in a very different context

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.180 align:middle line:90%
as an academician.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.639 align:middle line:84%
And here they were in a
completely different context.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.990 align:middle line:90%
That is, a UFO context.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And this immediate
thought came to me,

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.900 align:middle line:90%
and it wasn't are UFOs real.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.270 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't there yet.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.530 align:middle line:84%
I was interested in a
different question, which was,

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.700 align:middle line:84%
is this actually part
of my country's history?

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.140 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
were there, as it

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.990 align:middle line:84%
appeared in this book,
high-level national security

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.770 align:middle line:84%
figures who actually
were interested in this?

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And if they were, even if it
was a mistake, why had I never

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.560 align:middle line:84%
read about it in
any academic book?

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.610 align:middle line:84%
How could that not
be interesting?

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.860 align:middle line:84%
In what reality is
that not interesting?

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And so I just set out
to really investigate

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.460 align:middle line:90%
this on a personal basis.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.440 align:middle line:84%
I thought I'd take out
a couple of months,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.840 align:middle line:90%
resolve it for myself.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Everyone wonders at some point,
gee, is there a UFO cover-up?

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
all it was for me.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.201 align:middle line:84%
And I just was tired of having
these vague claims in front

00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:04.200 align:middle line:84%
of me that maybe there
is and maybe there isn't.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.580 align:middle line:84%
I didn't like that because
the way that I am, if there's

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.110 align:middle line:84%
one trait to describe me,
it's an insatiable curiosity.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.020 align:middle line:84%
It's almost a maniacal
curiosity about my world.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.260 align:middle line:90%
And I needed to know this.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.000 align:middle line:84%
So I just did what
I thought would

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.620 align:middle line:90%
be standard type of research.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Find out what's the
standard bibliography,

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.750 align:middle line:90%
the good books, the documents.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's when I got hooked,
because what I had discovered

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.090 align:middle line:84%
early on was that yes,
this was something that

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.440 align:middle line:84%
was taken seriously,
very seriously.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.712 align:middle line:90%
How do we know this?

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.970 align:middle line:84%
In our nation's history, we had
a period of time, late 1970s,

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.160 align:middle line:84%
particularly, when the
Freedom of Information Act

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.505 align:middle line:90%
was really useful.

00:03:42.505 --> 00:03:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And in which we got
thousands of pages

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.290 align:middle line:84%
of documents
pertaining to UFOs out.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.120 align:middle line:90%
And I'll tell you.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, of those
confirmed documents,

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.190 align:middle line:84%
you won't find this one document
that's the smoking gun that

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.610 align:middle line:84%
says-- like a memo from
the president that says,

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.590 align:middle line:84%
what we do about
these pesky aliens?

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.780 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the top
10, 20, 50 cumulatively--

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.160 align:middle line:84%
this is an open and shut case
here-- the phenomenon was real.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.029 align:middle line:84%
They were showing craft
that were violating

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:12.570 align:middle line:84%
sensitive airspace,
doing things that

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.300 align:middle line:84%
were not supposed
to be possible.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And our generals, admirals,
CIA high-level officials

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.380 align:middle line:84%
were concerned--
at the same time

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.320 align:middle line:84%
that they were telling
the world nothing to it

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.150 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
obvious discrepancy.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.575 align:middle line:84%
And once I saw that,
well, I was hooked.

00:04:29.575 --> 00:04:31.000 align:middle line:90%
I was absolutely hooked.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.980 align:middle line:90%
That's 20 years.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.780 align:middle line:84%
I've been working
this ever since.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've done
exhaustive research.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.200 align:middle line:84%
I think you're such a popular
guest on so many shows

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.840 align:middle line:84%
because it's very hard to
argue with your findings

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.120 align:middle line:84%
because you're not looking
for a specific point of view.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.850 align:middle line:84%
You're looking to
see what's real.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So you'll look, you'll check
both sides of the issues.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.730 align:middle line:84%
You don't necessarily just
take one person's testimony

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:53.470 align:middle line:90%
as truth.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.345 align:middle line:84%
You'll go ahead and
check into the background

00:04:55.345 --> 00:04:56.840 align:middle line:84%
of the individual,
corroborate it.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.220 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
say upfront you've

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.583 align:middle line:84%
done a beautiful job
journalistically--

00:04:59.583 --> 00:04:59.946 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Thank you.

00:04:59.946 --> 00:05:00.310 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.851 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --of
putting this together.

00:05:01.851 --> 00:05:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And that matters because it's
a subject that has a big giggle

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.540 align:middle line:84%
factor to it, and
that's really unfair.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, I think
in this period of history,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.197 align:middle line:84%
it's to our disadvantage
to keep it in that box.

00:05:14.197 --> 00:05:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: I could not agree more.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.050 align:middle line:84%
We're at a point
where, for a society

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.090 align:middle line:84%
which is to have
freedom, a country that's

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.960 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be a republic
on democratic principles,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:84%
if you do not have access
to your own history,

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.140 align:middle line:84%
how can you possibly
make informed

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.160 align:middle line:90%
decisions about your world?

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And what has happened
regarding the UFO phenomenon,

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.880 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, is
that our history

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.530 align:middle line:90%
has been stolen from us.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the main
important missions of my life

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.440 align:middle line:84%
is to reclaim, or to help us all
to reclaim that history, which

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.565 align:middle line:90%
belongs to all of us.

00:05:53.565 --> 00:05:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And before we
get into some of the really

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.620 align:middle line:84%
where the whole thing began, in
the United States that set off

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.440 align:middle line:84%
a chain, a series
of chain events

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.180 align:middle line:84%
that really affects
us all to this day,

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.679 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask you
one more question,

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and that is why did you
approach this book, "A.D.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.120 align:middle line:84%
After Disclosure" in
this way where you're

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.481 align:middle line:84%
weaving in a potential
future scenario with fact?

00:06:13.481 --> 00:06:13.980 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: "A.D." is a
real departure for me.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.300 align:middle line:10%
I wrote two volumes of history,
each 5, 600 pages called

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.030 align:middle line:10%
"UFOs and the National
Security State."

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.800 align:middle line:10%
And as you said, this
is archival research,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.680 align:middle line:10%
interviews with
high level people.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.200 align:middle line:10%
Really putting together
responsible history.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.870 align:middle line:10%
"A.D After Disclosure,"
on the other hand,

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.230 align:middle line:10%
is really a speculation
about the future.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.800 align:middle line:10%
Now, it's not a pie in
the sky speculation.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.490 align:middle line:10%
My co-author, Bryce Zabel and I
really set out as a think tank

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.597 align:middle line:10%
to try to look forward
and to speculate

00:06:46.597 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:10%
about something important.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.630 align:middle line:90%
Think of it this way.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.470 align:middle line:84%
If you assume UFOs
are real, and if you

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:55.090 align:middle line:84%
assume that there's a
cover-up-- which I assume yes

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.830 align:middle line:84%
in both of these-- then it's
really a logical question

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.869 align:middle line:84%
to ask, well, gee, what happens
if that cover-up were to end.

00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Because really, one
of the big themes

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.630 align:middle line:84%
in UFO research and the
related alternative community

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.800 align:middle line:90%
is the idea of disclosure.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.510 align:middle line:90%
That is, we need disclosure.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.730 align:middle line:90%
We need the truth.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:14.622 align:middle line:90%
We're living a lie.

00:07:14.622 --> 00:07:15.580 align:middle line:90%
Let's get to the truth.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.140 align:middle line:90%
All of which I agree with.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.440 align:middle line:84%
But what I found in the
last decade of being

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.870 align:middle line:84%
a public figure in this
field is that there's

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.260 align:middle line:84%
a lot of talk about
disclosure and precious little

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.530 align:middle line:84%
understanding of what
that actually would mean,

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.560 align:middle line:84%
other than basic utopian
types of ideas like oh

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.020 align:middle line:84%
yeah, free energy
and well, we'll

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:40.100 align:middle line:84%
become one with the galactic
federation of light.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, ideas that in my
view need a little bit

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:48.170 align:middle line:84%
more substance behind them for
me to give them some credence.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And what I wanted to do was
to look at the UFO phenomenon

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.440 align:middle line:84%
as a whole, really
understanding it.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And from that,
extrapolating out what

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.060 align:middle line:84%
is likely to happen in
the event of disclosure.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.044 align:middle line:84%
And more than that, how the
heck can disclosure even happen?

00:08:04.044 --> 00:08:05.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those are really
two important issues.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.592 align:middle line:84%
And many people have
said, well, look.

00:08:07.592 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Disclosure is never
going to happen, man,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:14.180 align:middle line:84%
because there's been secrecy
on this since the 1940s

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.340 align:middle line:90%
and it's never been broken.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.630 align:middle line:84%
What makes you think
it's going to happen now?

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.149 align:middle line:90%
So that's a valid question.

00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
that we address.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And then the whole rest of
this book, this exploration,

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.550 align:middle line:84%
is in trying to
understand what next.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And writing that book was
a truly great adventure.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I bet it was.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.039 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Every day we really
set out, thinking this through.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And what we realized is
that these issues really

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.120 align:middle line:84%
had not been discussed by any
writers in the field, and we--

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have not
seen anything like it.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is,
we say gee, what'll

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.130 align:middle line:84%
happen once they--
well, they already

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.499 align:middle line:90%
have flown over the capital.

00:08:47.499 --> 00:08:48.540 align:middle line:90%
That was a long time ago.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes, that's right.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
that's already happened.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.990 align:middle line:84%
These things have
already happened.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.250 align:middle line:84%
But what happens once
it's finally acknowledged?

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.930 align:middle line:84%
No one ever thinks
about what happens

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and what is affected,
right down to markets,

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.540 align:middle line:84%
global financial markets,
and many other things

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.060 align:middle line:84%
which we'll get
to a little later.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.490 align:middle line:84%
I want to get to the
case and the science

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.822 align:middle line:84%
that you've woven in here
because first of all,

00:09:07.822 --> 00:09:09.905 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
disclosure, after disclosure.

00:09:09.905 --> 00:09:10.599 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes.

00:09:10.599 --> 00:09:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.060 align:middle line:90%
There was a disclosure.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And we know that there
was that disclosure.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:17.587 align:middle line:84%
Steven Greer's effort,
National Press Club.

00:09:17.587 --> 00:09:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: The Disclosure Project.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.295 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
Disclosure Project.

00:09:20.295 --> 00:09:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying this was
an impressive effort.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:24.720 align:middle line:90%
I was there.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: You were, yeah.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.595 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: I was there.

00:09:26.595 --> 00:09:30.280 align:middle line:84%
I had access to the
various people testifying.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.790 align:middle line:90%
I saw them behind the scenes.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And I saw men who had broken
their national security

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:40.280 align:middle line:84%
oaths to show up and do this who
were in tears because they had

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.800 align:middle line:84%
held onto this fear for so long
of what would happen to them

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.030 align:middle line:84%
and their family if
they ever talked openly.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:46.080 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.817 align:middle line:84%
And I heard-- well,
you know of much of it.

00:09:48.817 --> 00:09:50.150 align:middle line:90%
Some of it is even in this book.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Some of the incidences that they
spoke about are in this book.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you had maybe two
ti-- the room was packed.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Right.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Huge online audience.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Largest audience since
Monica Lewinsky's blue dress

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:06.890 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:06.980 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was the second
largest audience ever.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:09.530 align:middle line:90%
That was a big audience.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:10.238 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Oh yeah.

00:10:10.238 --> 00:10:11.614 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And yet nothing.

00:10:11.614 --> 00:10:12.905 align:middle line:90%
Nothing on American television.

00:10:12.905 --> 00:10:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: No, correct.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:14.409 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:10:14.409 --> 00:10:16.552 align:middle line:90%
It just was a big fat zero.

00:10:16.552 --> 00:10:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's not as though
there haven't been efforts.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.810 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, it has to
be forced to such an extent.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:24.917 align:middle line:84%
And now let's take it back
to where a lot of this

00:10:24.917 --> 00:10:27.000 align:middle line:84%
really started, at least
the US part of the story.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Different in Germany
and the Soviet Union.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.260 align:middle line:90%
But let's start at Roswell.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.600 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: Well, Roswell
is, in a lot of ways,

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.020 align:middle line:10%
where it's appropriate
to start there.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.430 align:middle line:10%
Something happened at Roswell.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.450 align:middle line:10%
Something very, very important.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.137 align:middle line:10%
Look, to this day
there are multiple-- I

00:10:42.137 --> 00:10:43.720 align:middle line:10%
was going to say
two, but really there

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.280 align:middle line:10%
are more than two sides
of the Roswell debate.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.670 align:middle line:10%
There's lots of nuance in this.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:52.130 align:middle line:10%
I do come down on the side
that there was an event,

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.874 align:middle line:10%
let's call it extraterrestrial.

00:10:53.874 --> 00:10:54.540 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it wasn't.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.080 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't us.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.470 align:middle line:90%
That's what I will say.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.470 align:middle line:90%
In the book "A.D."

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Bryce and I use the
phrase the others

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.330 align:middle line:84%
because I don't
really know that they

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:03.760 align:middle line:90%
are truly extraterrestrial.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.430 align:middle line:90%
I think that they are.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:10.160 align:middle line:84%
What happened at Roswell is that
during the height of the flying

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.550 align:middle line:84%
saucer wave that was
overtaking the United States--

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.820 align:middle line:84%
it was a big, big, lots
of talk about this.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:20.850 align:middle line:84%
In the midst of that, the
United States Army Air Force

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.330 align:middle line:84%
stated to the world
that they had recovered

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.702 align:middle line:84%
one of those flying discs
outside Roswell, New Mexico.

00:11:28.702 --> 00:11:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And then three hours later,
retracted the whole thing

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.670 align:middle line:90%
and said oh, no, sorry.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:34.780 align:middle line:90%
Just a weather balloon.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:35.930 align:middle line:90%
Sorry for the confusion.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And then that story
was-- died for 30 years

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.760 align:middle line:84%
until it was resurrected
by a number of researchers

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.730 align:middle line:84%
who found some of the
original witnesses.

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Roswell, I think,
absolutely happened,

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's a
good starting point.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.170 align:middle line:90%
So let's just say that it did.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.747 align:middle line:84%
So you're the President
of United States.

00:11:51.747 --> 00:11:52.580 align:middle line:90%
You're Harry Truman.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And let's say I'm your top
general or scientific adviser.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And I will come to
you and say, sir,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.340 align:middle line:84%
we have recovered
technology that does not

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.035 align:middle line:84%
appear to have been manufactured
by our civilization.

00:12:06.035 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's really
where it starts.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:08.910 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
you're being told

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:12.850 align:middle line:84%
not simply that there are
these objects out there,

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.300 align:middle line:84%
but that we got some
of that technology.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.490 align:middle line:84%
So you've got this heavy-duty
decision to think about.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:20.660 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.460 align:middle line:90%
Do you tell the world?

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.630 align:middle line:84%
It's quite possible
that your instinct

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.900 align:middle line:84%
might have been the
world should know.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.140 align:middle line:90%
But then you think about it.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.556 align:middle line:84%
Or your advisers, like me, who
would talk to you about it.

00:12:30.556 --> 00:12:31.990 align:middle line:10%
And you would
realize that if you

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle line:10%
told the world you had
this exotic technology,

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.880 align:middle line:10%
then it becomes very
difficult not to share it.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.020 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, I was just
going to bring that up.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:39.840 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: Not to share it.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.530 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's one
big incentive, yes.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.946 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: I mean,
after all, you've

00:12:42.946 --> 00:12:45.310 align:middle line:10%
got the incipient
Cold War taking place.

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.271 align:middle line:10%
The Soviet Union and the United
States were not friendly.

00:12:48.271 --> 00:12:49.770 align:middle line:10%
And then other
nations in the world.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:51.228 align:middle line:10%
Maybe you don't
want to share this.

00:12:51.228 --> 00:12:54.476 align:middle line:10%
And the other thing is it's
very likely that they would not

00:12:54.476 --> 00:12:56.350 align:middle line:10%
have had a whole lot of
information about who

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:57.925 align:middle line:10%
these other beings were anyway.

00:12:57.925 --> 00:12:59.800 align:middle line:10%
You're going to go tell
the world about this.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to have
to answer a lot of questions.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.290 align:middle line:84%
You may not have
the information.

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:04.850 align:middle line:84%
So what would do
logically, and I

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.860 align:middle line:84%
think this is-- all of
the leaked documents,

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.380 align:middle line:84%
the majestic documents is what
we call, do indicate this.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.050 align:middle line:90%
I think this is true.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:16.340 align:middle line:84%
You'd gather together
your most reliable people.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And you would say,
all right, folks,

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.285 align:middle line:90%
we're going to figure this out.

00:13:20.285 --> 00:13:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Each person is going
to have their job.

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:23.940 align:middle line:84%
You're going to figure
out-- let's study

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.720 align:middle line:84%
the technology, what
we can do with it.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.290 align:middle line:84%
You're going to figure out
how bad the panic might be

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:90%
and how we'll contain it.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.019 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
manage the press.

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:33.060 align:middle line:84%
You're going to deal with
the academic community.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going to keep this
whole thing contained.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
logical things I think

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.860 align:middle line:90%
is exactly what they did.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.280 align:middle line:90%
And here's the thing, though.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.140 align:middle line:84%
You might say we'll revisit
this in a couple of years

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.770 align:middle line:90%
and decide on our game plan.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.130 align:middle line:90%
But, see, secrecy.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Once secrecy like
this gets started,

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:57.680 align:middle line:84%
I think it becomes very
difficult to stop that secret

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.160 align:middle line:84%
because the deeper you go,
the more difficult it becomes.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.731 align:middle line:90%
For example, the technology.

00:14:03.731 --> 00:14:04.606 align:middle line:90%
Let's say, all right.

00:14:04.606 --> 00:14:08.480 align:middle line:84%
So you've got some various
pieces of alien tech.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.950 align:middle line:90%
How do you study them?

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.627 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Army and the military,
they've got smart people.

00:14:12.627 --> 00:14:14.210 align:middle line:84%
But realistically,
they're going to go

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:18.840 align:middle line:84%
to various private laboratories,
various private contractors--

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Lockheed, General Electric,
Boeing, and so forth.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Those are the organizations
that actually have the ability

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.282 align:middle line:84%
not just to study this stuff,
but maybe to replicate it.

00:14:27.282 --> 00:14:28.365 align:middle line:90%
They've got the engineers.

00:14:28.365 --> 00:14:29.780 align:middle line:90%
They've got the facilities.

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.740 align:middle line:90%
So the technology goes out.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And the question it
becomes, who owns it?

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.470 align:middle line:90%
There's an interesting question.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.470 align:middle line:84%
I assume that the
lawyers privately,

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.870 align:middle line:90%
covertly hammered all that out.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a little bit private,
maybe a little bit government.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.590 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, now
a few more years go by

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:49.725 align:middle line:84%
and now scientists start
having little mini eureka

00:14:49.725 --> 00:14:51.600 align:middle line:84%
moments where they start
figuring things out.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not completely
duplicating every single aspect

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.480 align:middle line:84%
of the electromagnetic
properties of this object.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.380 align:middle line:84%
But maybe they can
have some good ideas

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.490 align:middle line:84%
that lead to other
breakthroughs, things

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:04.454 align:middle line:84%
like fiber optics or
high tensile fiber or--

00:15:04.454 --> 00:15:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's go there because
that's an advance in the story.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Now you're leaping forward
about 13, 14 years, by 1961.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is according
to-- I appreciate

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.200 align:middle line:90%
the work of Philip Corso.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And so his claim is
that as a person that

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.530 align:middle line:84%
was working for the
Foreign Technologies

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Division of the Army-- and that
doesn't mean out of country,

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:28.250 align:middle line:90%
it means out of this world.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Foreign technology,
unknown technologies.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:35.210 align:middle line:84%
He was given scraps of the
materials of the evidence that

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:39.470 align:middle line:84%
had been gathered and scooped
up now 13, 14 years prior.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And they're now saying maybe it
was that the industrial complex

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:46.690 align:middle line:90%
wasn't really ready for it.

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there had to be a certain
kind of critical understanding.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:49.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.200 align:middle line:90%
But it was years.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Years passed before he
was given those pieces

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:55.914 align:middle line:90%
to have analyzed and parted out.

00:15:55.914 --> 00:15:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I have a number
of thoughts on Corso.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's been a
very contentious figure

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:01.750 align:middle line:90%
among UFO researchers.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:03.650 align:middle line:84%
There have been a lot
of errors in the book

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.420 align:middle line:84%
that he co-authored with
William Burns, called "The Day

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.230 align:middle line:90%
After Roswell."

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:07.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:09.173 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: The thing
is, I fundamentally

00:16:09.173 --> 00:16:12.580 align:middle line:84%
do think that Corso is
correct or was truthful.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.310 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
a lot in that book--

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.770 align:middle line:84%
his original notes
were actually not

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.290 align:middle line:90%
nearly as polished as the book.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: A lot ot it
was kind of haphazard.

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:22.876 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is true.

00:16:22.876 --> 00:16:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And it's also true
that Corso, who was US Army,

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:33.570 align:middle line:84%
was only one, one aspect of the
whole Roswell technology thing.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And he had no way of
knowing, of course,

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.140 align:middle line:84%
about the other things
that were going on.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.030 align:middle line:84%
So people have said,
well, it took 13 years

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:42.870 align:middle line:84%
for this technology
to get out there.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:90%
I doubt that's the case.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.790 align:middle line:84%
I think more likely is that
other agencies had access

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:50.225 align:middle line:84%
to other types of technology
and that it was already out

00:16:50.225 --> 00:16:52.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's just
when they dumped it off

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.190 align:middle line:90%
on him and his office.

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:54.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's correct.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.450 align:middle line:90%
His aspect of it alone.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Now, he
described something

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.500 align:middle line:84%
that I think is very plausible
and actually that I think

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:04.069 align:middle line:84%
is true, which is that he
was a liaison, essentially,

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:07.140 align:middle line:84%
between the US military and
these private contractors.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.579 align:middle line:90%
And this was exactly his point.

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:12.190 align:middle line:84%
All I can say is that
I never met Corso.

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:15.740 align:middle line:84%
He died shortly before I kind
of got out here in this field.

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.910 align:middle line:84%
I know a number of people
who did know Philip Corso.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:21.349 align:middle line:84%
I've never met anyone
who knew him well

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:23.815 align:middle line:90%
who thought that he was lying.

00:17:23.815 --> 00:17:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's very
likely that he may

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.870 align:middle line:84%
have had a fuzzy memory on
this, that, or the other thing.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.100 align:middle line:84%
There certainly, as
I say, were mistakes.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Certain factual
mistakes in his book.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: But if you just stick
to the basic stuff, which

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.350 align:middle line:84%
is the pieces of tech,
that's where he really

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.870 align:middle line:84%
focused because he said he
felt like a child at Christmas

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.800 align:middle line:84%
when they dumped
this file cabinet off

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.580 align:middle line:90%
with this strange debris in it.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.994 align:middle line:84%
He was sitting on the floor
in his home looking at it.

00:17:46.994 --> 00:17:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's right.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:50.035 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why do I even,
where do I even take this?

00:17:50.035 --> 00:17:50.930 align:middle line:90%
How do I even begin?

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And so that seemed to be
fairly electrically wired

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.172 align:middle line:84%
into his mind, that
part, it seems to me.

00:17:56.172 --> 00:17:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, I think
that's reasonable.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's reasonable.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean now,
again, he's not alive,

00:17:59.160 --> 00:17:59.993 align:middle line:90%
so it's hard to say.

00:17:59.993 --> 00:18:03.260 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking about
technology that ultimately

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.130 align:middle line:90%
became widely used in the '60s.

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Transistors.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:07.610 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.485 align:middle line:84%
Everybody had their
little transistor radios.

00:18:09.485 --> 00:18:10.195 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's right.

00:18:10.195 --> 00:18:10.610 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.443 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that all
came out in the '60s.

00:18:12.443 --> 00:18:13.710 align:middle line:90%
It was supposedly transistors.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Kevlar used for police
protection and their vests.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.029 align:middle line:90%
And fiber optics.

00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.945 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes, exactly.

00:18:19.945 --> 00:18:20.445 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:20.445 --> 00:18:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lasers.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.234 align:middle line:84%
All these things he claims
came out of Roswell.

00:18:25.234 --> 00:18:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's right.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.649 align:middle line:90%
He does.

00:18:26.649 --> 00:18:30.969 align:middle line:84%
And to me, I think that that's
very likely the case, actually.

00:18:30.969 --> 00:18:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look at
the history of each one

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.134 align:middle line:84%
of those technologies,
you're not

00:18:34.134 --> 00:18:35.700 align:middle line:84%
going to find a
reference to Roswell.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, of course not.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And so mainstream
historians of technology

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:42.570 align:middle line:84%
will say, well,
that's just nonsense

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:43.710 align:middle line:90%
because you can trace these.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:44.376 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:44.376 --> 00:18:46.422 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: But here's the
thing is, all right?

00:18:46.422 --> 00:18:49.510 align:middle line:84%
What Corso says actually does
not contradict any of that.

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.950 align:middle line:90%
He's just adding another piece.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:56.650 align:middle line:84%
He's stating that
key concepts came

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:01.400 align:middle line:84%
to these various corporations
via the Roswell connection.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
have to keep in mind

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.924 align:middle line:84%
it's not like these corporations
are just going to say,

00:19:05.924 --> 00:19:07.590 align:middle line:84%
"Oh yeah, well, we
got it from Roswell."

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course not.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And this
was back when I

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:12.730 align:middle line:84%
was talking a little earlier
about the money going

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:13.700 align:middle line:90%
privately.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Once you start getting
breakthroughs, all right?

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.020 align:middle line:84%
There goes any incentive
for giving this secret up

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.525 align:middle line:84%
because now you've
got a moneymaker.

00:19:20.525 --> 00:19:21.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: You've got this
goose that lays golden eggs.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And really, what would
be your incentive

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:29.520 align:middle line:90%
for telling the world?

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I'm the
Air Force or the Army

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.130 align:middle line:90%
and you're a private contractor.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.980 align:middle line:84%
So I've ceded some of
this technology to you.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.670 align:middle line:90%
So you guys have control of it.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Maybe after I retire, I get to
work for you as a senior vice

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.810 align:middle line:84%
president, because that's really
how the whole thing worked.

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:46.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's a nice little
happy family here.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:51.790 align:middle line:84%
We have no desire whatsoever
to give this secret up.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And what we see further
is very good evidence

00:19:55.210 --> 00:20:00.090 align:middle line:84%
that the operational power, the
executive decision-making power

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:03.970 align:middle line:84%
over the UFO cover-up slipped
away from the United States

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:06.810 align:middle line:84%
President very likely
even during the Eisenhower

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:08.742 align:middle line:84%
administration, and
certainly increasingly

00:20:08.742 --> 00:20:09.950 align:middle line:90%
through the subsequent years.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:11.740 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And so now we're not talking
about just technology here.

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Corso said that he was allowed
to see one of the bodies that

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:23.710 align:middle line:84%
was suspended in a type of
formaldehyde or something

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:25.390 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And he seemed to be-- well,
in his writing, anyway--

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.079 align:middle line:90%
very shaken over this.

00:20:31.079 --> 00:20:31.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Totally
freaked him out,

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:35.670 align:middle line:84%
and didn't know if he wanted
to even go any further on it.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:37.600 align:middle line:84%
He is not the only
one who claims

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.790 align:middle line:84%
to have seen the body of
the what is essentially

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.380 align:middle line:84%
a little gray type of being
similar to what we're seeing

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.880 align:middle line:90%
on the screen right now, yes.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: He says he saw
it at Fort Riley, Kansas.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:50.727 align:middle line:84%
He has a very detailed story
about how that happened.

00:20:50.727 --> 00:20:53.644 align:middle line:84%
Again, I don't know if
this will ever be proven.

00:20:53.644 --> 00:20:55.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it can be
proven one way or the other.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.940 align:middle line:84%
But I don't see
it as impossible.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I think it is possible.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.900 align:middle line:84%
I have a hard time
thinking-- but that's not

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.215 align:middle line:90%
something you'd misremember.

00:21:05.215 --> 00:21:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: So if you
saw an ET being,

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.420 align:middle line:90%
you're going to remember that.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Either he's
lying or he saw it.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:09.122 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah.

00:21:09.122 --> 00:21:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about
Corso people ought

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:13.225 align:middle line:84%
to remember is that he had
a very, very good reputation

00:21:13.225 --> 00:21:15.240 align:middle line:84%
amongst colleagues
in the military.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Senator Strom Thurmond, for
whom he was a military liaison,

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.260 align:middle line:84%
wrote the original
forward to Corso's book.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:27.900 align:middle line:84%
This was before Thurmond knew
it was a UFO type of book,

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.580 align:middle line:90%
and that forward was taken out.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:30.130 align:middle line:90%
I have the original copy.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just
validating his character.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: He said, look, Philip
Corso's an American hero,

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.650 align:middle line:90%
and praised him to the skies.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Corso had a very good reputation
within the United States

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:42.850 align:middle line:84%
Congress for other
types of testimony

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:44.220 align:middle line:90%
he'd given on other matters.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.972 align:middle line:84%
He was a known figure who did
have the respect of people.

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's why I
wanted to bring him up and get

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:52.190 align:middle line:84%
all the technologies, the
little alien body, everything

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.090 align:middle line:84%
out on the table
at the same time

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.100 align:middle line:84%
through part of the
cover-up operation.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.600 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed
other people, read

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.950 align:middle line:84%
a lot of documents about
people who were threatened

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:05.109 align:middle line:84%
if they were to
speak of the event.

00:22:05.109 --> 00:22:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about
witnesses in Roswell.

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's right.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There is no
shortage of stories of people.

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:10.675 align:middle line:90%
Now, most of them are dead.

00:22:10.675 --> 00:22:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's correct.

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.487 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But many, many people
finally came forward and said,

00:22:14.487 --> 00:22:15.570 align:middle line:90%
we couldn't talk about it.

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.010 align:middle line:90%
They threatened our lives.

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:17.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:18.009 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: No.

00:22:18.009 --> 00:22:20.314 align:middle line:84%
And in "A.D. After
Disclosure," Bryce

00:22:20.314 --> 00:22:22.230 align:middle line:84%
and I recounted the story
of one such witness.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:25.764 align:middle line:84%
She was a young girl
at the time and talked.

00:22:25.764 --> 00:22:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And this interview just
took place a couple of years

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.190 align:middle line:84%
ago, when we were
writing the book.

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:34.080 align:middle line:84%
She was very shaken
over-- she was told,

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.440 align:middle line:84%
you know, if you
talk about this,

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.155 align:middle line:84%
we'll take you out to the desert
and no one will ever find you.

00:22:40.155 --> 00:22:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: She was, like,
a 10, 11-year-old girl.

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And the officer
who told her, says,

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:48.110 align:middle line:90%
"You did not see that material."

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And she's thinking,
well, no, I did see it.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.500 align:middle line:90%
He says, "You're not hearing me.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.580 align:middle line:90%
You did not see that material."

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And he had to repeat it, like,
three or four times until she

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.080 align:middle line:90%
finally got it.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And this happened to everyone
who was witness to it.

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And there were
quite a few of them.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:03.806 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's right.

00:23:03.806 --> 00:23:06.780 align:middle line:84%
These stories, they are the
typical Roswell witness story.

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:07.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And the reason this is
so important in my mind--

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.650 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to start at Roswell
rather than anywhere else--

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:15.540 align:middle line:84%
is because after
that, you started

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:18.939 align:middle line:84%
seeing the establishing
of some agencies.

00:23:18.939 --> 00:23:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yep.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Many feel that
this was in direct response

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:24.170 align:middle line:90%
to the UFO issue.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.220 align:middle line:84%
How you start
classifying documents.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.850 align:middle line:84%
How you start intimidating
people into shutting up.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Here we have the beginning
of, as I recall, the NSA.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:33.680 align:middle line:90%
Shortly after that, the CIA.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.950 align:middle line:84%
You had Project Blue
Book and a lot of these.

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:39.110 align:middle line:84%
All of this led
to the suppression

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.904 align:middle line:84%
of information moving
outward toward the public.

00:23:41.904 --> 00:23:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's right.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.650 align:middle line:90%
The CIA was formed in 1947.

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:50.010 align:middle line:84%
It grew out of some earlier--
it grew out of the OSS

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:52.950 align:middle line:84%
from World War II, ultimately,
and then evolved into the CIA

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:54.300 align:middle line:90%
by 1947.

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.440 align:middle line:84%
1947 was what we have the
National Security Act.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.220 align:middle line:84%
It established an
independent air force,

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.930 align:middle line:90%
CIA, National Security Council.

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:04.384 align:middle line:84%
It really created
the modern structure.

00:24:04.384 --> 00:24:06.050 align:middle line:84%
A couple of years
after that-- actually,

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:07.920 align:middle line:84%
at the end of
Truman's presidency--

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.360 align:middle line:84%
we have the formal
creation, secretly,

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.570 align:middle line:90%
of the National Security Agency.

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Do you realize nobody
knew about the NSA

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:18.460 align:middle line:84%
literally for over a
decade of its existence?

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was the most
powerful intelligence agency

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:22.950 align:middle line:90%
in the country.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And nobody knew it existed
until the mid-1960s.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:30.480 align:middle line:84%
By that time, NSA had by far
the best computers in the world.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was this
totally secret agency.

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Tells you something
about America's history.

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And remains so.

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:39.690 align:middle line:84%
We have so many
black ops projects

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:41.770 align:middle line:84%
that are controlled
by that agency.

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:44.080 align:middle line:90%
Here we have these, what is it?

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.650 align:middle line:90%
What was it? $3.7 trillion.

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:49.380 align:middle line:84%
Correct me if I'm
wrong on the math.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Just a couple of years ago,
a few years ago, Rumsfeld

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.035 align:middle line:90%
was having to answer for this--

00:24:54.035 --> 00:24:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Close.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:55.703 align:middle line:90%
He said 2.6--

00:24:55.703 --> 00:24:56.525 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 2.6.

00:24:56.525 --> 00:24:57.733 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Then amended to 2.3.

00:24:57.733 --> 00:25:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: $2.3 trillion
of missing funds, OK?

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And we know that a lot of
that is swallowed up now.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.352 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the evidence
seems pretty clear.

00:25:06.352 --> 00:25:07.810 align:middle line:84%
A lot of that has
been swallowed up

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:11.275 align:middle line:84%
by this, the NSA and these
black operations budgets.

00:25:11.275 --> 00:25:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Right.

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.811 align:middle line:84%
This has been my argument
for some time also.

00:25:14.811 --> 00:25:16.935 align:middle line:84%
During the '90s, during
the Clinton administration,

00:25:16.935 --> 00:25:20.360 align:middle line:84%
there was a law that was
enacted that essentially forced

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:24.140 align:middle line:84%
or mandated the US
government to account

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.560 align:middle line:84%
for its money in a more
businesslike manner.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And from that point,
Rumsfeld's statement

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.140 align:middle line:84%
was actually the
last in a series.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.880 align:middle line:84%
Through the '90s, there
were these various reports

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.780 align:middle line:90%
from the Senate and Congress.

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:38.070 align:middle line:84%
$1.1 trillion missing,
you know, $1.5 trillion.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do you
misplace trillions?

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:40.635 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Right.

00:25:40.635 --> 00:25:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, the way that
the official explana--

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:44.690 align:middle line:84%
because I tried
figuring this out.

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Because in Rumsfeld's case,
he made this statement just

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:49.900 align:middle line:90%
before 9/11/2001.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:51.820 align:middle line:84%
The Pentagon's
budget at that time

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.420 align:middle line:84%
was about one
eighth that amount.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.830 align:middle line:90%
It was about $310 billion.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So how do you lose seven or
eight times your annual budget?

00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:59.260 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense.

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.322 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, he rectified it.

00:26:01.322 --> 00:26:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: They said they did.

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know,
I'm teasing you.

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Which was funny.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know
they said they did.

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: What they say
is that, well, these

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.680 align:middle line:90%
were accounting discrepancies.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, there's a lot,
hundreds of accounting systems,

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:12.460 align:middle line:90%
computerized systems.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And in reconciling,
there was all this money,

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:17.050 align:middle line:84%
they said, no, no,
it wasn't all stolen.

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:20.310 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, a lot
of it was stolen.

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And then the clincher is
a couple of years later,

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:28.340 align:middle line:84%
they said, oh yeah, well, we got
that number from 2.6 trillion

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.310 align:middle line:90%
down to zero.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:30.400 align:middle line:90%
We've resolved all of it.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.930 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's where I'm just out.

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:36.040 align:middle line:84%
That's like a student who gets
an F. And instead of changing

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.220 align:middle line:84%
his grade to a D,
which is believable,

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.470 align:middle line:90%
he changes it to an A.

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:41.726 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: There's
just some general

00:26:41.726 --> 00:26:44.384 align:middle line:84%
that says I want
that number to zero.

00:26:44.384 --> 00:26:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And you know that's
what they did.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.299 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the thing is,
it's taking the people for being

00:26:48.299 --> 00:26:50.380 align:middle line:84%
super ignorant, all of
us for being ignorant.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And that has been something that
they have been perpetrating--

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and in a sense,
in some cases even

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.620 align:middle line:84%
relying on now--
for several decades.

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to take a
break in just a minute here.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.800 align:middle line:84%
But when we come back, I want
to talk about the Condon Report.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.300 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.070 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about
the Condon Report.

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:08.195 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes, by all means.

00:27:08.195 --> 00:27:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then in
opposition to that,

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:14.080 align:middle line:84%
what the French finally came
out with in trying to genuinely

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:18.090 align:middle line:84%
reveal some of what was going on
behind extraterrestrial contact

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:19.330 align:middle line:90%
and UFOs.

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So meanwhile, we're going
to take just a short break.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:22.624 align:middle line:90%
Stay with us.

00:27:22.624 --> 00:27:23.790 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back in just a sec.

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:32.370 align:middle line:90%


00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:33.760 align:middle line:90%
We are back with Richard Dolan.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
the Condon Report,

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:38.840 align:middle line:84%
because there was
supposedly an attempt

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.545 align:middle line:84%
to put all the
evidence together--

00:27:40.545 --> 00:27:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's right.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.175 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and
then release that

00:27:42.175 --> 00:27:43.940 align:middle line:84%
to the public to
some satisfaction.

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.460 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what
really happened.

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: It's very
important, actually,

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.910 align:middle line:90%
that people understand this.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Through the 1950s and '60s,
the United States Air Force

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:54.770 align:middle line:84%
was officially responsible,
in the public's eyes,

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:58.230 align:middle line:84%
for investigating UFO reports,
which actually today there's

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.030 align:middle line:84%
no agency in the
government that does this.

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:02.290 align:middle line:10%
But in the '50s and
'60s, if you saw

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:04.730 align:middle line:10%
what you thought
might be a UFO-- hey,

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:06.670 align:middle line:10%
you didn't have to
believe it was a real UFO,

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:08.640 align:middle line:10%
but you could do
your patriotic duty

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.180 align:middle line:10%
and report it to the Air Force.

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.450 align:middle line:10%
And in theory, they
had this project

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:15.200 align:middle line:10%
called Blue Book that would
looking into the reports.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.040 align:middle line:10%
Well, the problem
was that A, there

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.255 align:middle line:10%
were a lot of UFO reports.

00:28:19.255 --> 00:28:21.380 align:middle line:10%
Blue Book really did not
have a lot of credibility.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.917 align:middle line:10%
People were making jokes.

00:28:23.917 --> 00:28:25.500 align:middle line:10%
You know, the Air
Force's explanations

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:29.120 align:middle line:10%
were ridiculous
in so many cases.

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.770 align:middle line:84%
People had been talking about
swamp gas as an explanation.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:32.887 align:middle line:90%
It was a big joke.

00:28:32.887 --> 00:28:35.220 align:middle line:84%
So the Air Force is thinking,
we got to get rid of this.

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:36.303 align:middle line:90%
We got to get rid of this.

00:28:36.303 --> 00:28:38.110 align:middle line:84%
So they looked around,
and they contracted

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:41.270 align:middle line:84%
with the University
of Colorado in 1966.

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:42.020 align:middle line:90%
And they said, OK.

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:45.700 align:middle line:84%
You guys are going to do
a scientific investigation

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:46.420 align:middle line:90%
of UFOs.

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:49.270 align:middle line:84%
And whatever you say,
we will abide by it.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you recommend that
we continue studying UFOs,

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.180 align:middle line:90%
we will.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.139 align:middle line:84%
If you recommend we
discontinue, we'll do that.

00:28:54.139 --> 00:28:56.221 align:middle line:84%
The thing was, that whole
thing was a rigged game.

00:28:56.221 --> 00:28:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Totally rigged game.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.530 align:middle line:84%
The Condon Report's called that
because the Colorado project

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:04.910 align:middle line:84%
was led by a physicist
named Edward Condon.

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:07.390 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely slam dunk.

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Condon and his
number one assistant,

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:13.140 align:middle line:84%
a guy named Robert
Lowe, were both dead set

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.120 align:middle line:84%
against, from the beginning,
any kind of pro-UFO conclusion.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:20.025 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we know from one of the
members of the committee Condon

00:29:20.025 --> 00:29:23.584 align:middle line:84%
said privately, if we were to
get an affirmative conclusion,

00:29:23.584 --> 00:29:25.250 align:middle line:84%
he said, that's not
going to the public.

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:27.441 align:middle line:84%
That's going in a locked
briefcase to the president.

00:29:27.441 --> 00:29:28.940 align:middle line:84%
There was no way
this was ever going

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.065 align:middle line:90%
to be a positive conclusion.

00:29:31.065 --> 00:29:32.690 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing about
the Condon Report

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:36.090 align:middle line:84%
is despite Condon's very
negative conclusion, which

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:40.835 align:middle line:84%
came out in 1969, beginning
of '69, within the report

00:29:40.835 --> 00:29:46.410 align:middle line:84%
were actually many, many
incredibly unexplainable cases.

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:47.730 align:middle line:90%
But Condon just ignored that.

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:48.430 align:middle line:90%
He said, nope.

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.650 align:middle line:90%
No probative value.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:54.090 align:middle line:84%
In other words, UFOs offer
us no value scientifically.

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:55.890 align:middle line:90%
Air Force should drop it.

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:57.840 align:middle line:90%
Air Force did drop Blue Book.

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And ever since then,
you and me and the rest

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:04.470 align:middle line:84%
of the American public has no
agency within the government

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:06.130 align:middle line:90%
to report a UFO to.

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:07.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's important.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.321 align:middle line:84%
People could say that Blue
Book was a joke, which it was.

00:30:10.321 --> 00:30:11.070 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:13.180 align:middle line:90%
I say it was our joke.

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that there
is no government agency

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:20.790 align:middle line:84%
now tells me that this
important phenomenon, which

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:26.220 align:middle line:84%
affects everyone-- it really
does-- has been removed.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Our government has broken
away from us on this.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And we have no way of getting
our government, which we're

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:35.440 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be in charge
of, to respond to this.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's really, it's a
failure of democratic rule.

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:39.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.999 align:middle line:84%
Now let's juxtapose that to the
COMETA Report out of France.

00:30:42.999 --> 00:30:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.123 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a very
interesting thing.

00:30:45.123 --> 00:30:47.950 align:middle line:84%
In the 1990s, late
'90s, in France,

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:51.200 align:middle line:84%
you have a number of very
high-level French government

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.860 align:middle line:90%
and military officials.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.690 align:middle line:84%
It was a kind of
an official study

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:57.350 align:middle line:90%
and kind of an unofficial study.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they do
this is for deniability.

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, it
was not hard to see why,

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:06.700 align:middle line:84%
because you had a detailed
scientific analysis of UFOs

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.920 align:middle line:84%
called the COMETA Report,
in which they said

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.850 align:middle line:84%
this is some really serious
stuff going on here, which

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:14.800 align:middle line:84%
looks like it's
extraterrestrial.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.260 align:middle line:84%
We have cases in our
files that are utterly

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.820 align:middle line:84%
inexplicable from any
conventional point of view.

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:21.235 align:middle line:10%
Science needs to investigate.

00:31:21.235 --> 00:31:24.410 align:middle line:10%
So the exact opposite conclusion
of the Condon Committee.

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:28.490 align:middle line:10%
And the COMETA Report,
it's extremely well done.

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:32.210 align:middle line:10%
And it got little
to no resonance

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:33.790 align:middle line:10%
within the United States media.

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:36.445 align:middle line:90%
US media just let it go.

00:31:36.445 --> 00:31:38.070 align:middle line:84%
A little byline in
the "New York Times"

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:39.195 align:middle line:90%
and that was the end of it.

00:31:39.195 --> 00:31:40.000 align:middle line:90%
So no follow-up.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.458 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
not just France.

00:31:41.458 --> 00:31:45.320 align:middle line:84%
We also have Mexico, Brazil,
Russia, other countries

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.190 align:middle line:84%
who have made a
legitimate effort

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:48.630 align:middle line:90%
to look into the phenomena.

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: They've made
an effort and they've

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.030 align:middle line:84%
made various
statements that have

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:52.559 align:middle line:90%
been very interesting indeed.

00:31:52.559 --> 00:31:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, they have.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So US is unique in this
way, that we're really

00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.041 align:middle line:84%
holding on to this
denial of the subject.

00:32:00.041 --> 00:32:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: To some extent.

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.840 align:middle line:84%
The other nations
have always stopped

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.594 align:middle line:84%
short of the
ultimate disclosure.

00:32:04.594 --> 00:32:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's true.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: None of them have said
it looks like it's-- we are

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.550 align:middle line:84%
telling you that it's
extraterrestrial.

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: They've not done that.

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, they
haven't done that.

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:14.216 align:middle line:90%
They've stopped short.

00:32:14.216 --> 00:32:16.680 align:middle line:84%
But at least they've thrown
the people a bone or two.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:16.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's right.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some
significant bones,

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:19.520 align:middle line:90%
such as in the COMETA Report.

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's exactly right.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.930 align:middle line:84%
So now that we're
looking at that,

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:23.630 align:middle line:90%
we need to go back a little bit.

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Here you have all this
exotic technology.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Much of it made
its way to market

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and we've been using
it for decades now.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:30.400 align:middle line:90%
But much of it never did.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.639 align:middle line:90%
They continued developing.

00:32:32.639 --> 00:32:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.221 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They continued
research and development

00:32:35.221 --> 00:32:38.400 align:middle line:84%
to a very high extent,
to the point where--

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:42.580 align:middle line:84%
I think you comment in
your book that there

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:46.550 align:middle line:84%
was a quote by someone stating
that the technology that

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:50.390 align:middle line:84%
has been developed since
then, in black ops,

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:54.750 align:middle line:84%
is 50 to 100 years advanced
of anything that we,

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:57.927 align:middle line:84%
the citizenry, will ever
benefit from or see.

00:32:57.927 --> 00:32:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I think
that's exactly right.

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, you also call
this a breakaway civilization.

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:02.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's get into it.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.310 align:middle line:90%
Just tell us about that.

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: The
breakaway civilization

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:07.223 align:middle line:84%
is an idea that I've been
working for a number of years.

00:33:07.223 --> 00:33:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's a phrase that
I coined in, actually,

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:11.170 align:middle line:84%
an earlier book, my
second volume of history,

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:13.390 align:middle line:84%
but really expanded and
worked in this book, "A.D.

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:14.675 align:middle line:90%
After Disclosure."

00:33:14.675 --> 00:33:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is-- you sort
of introduced it very well

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:17.974 align:middle line:90%
a moment ago.

00:33:17.974 --> 00:33:19.640 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you've
got this technology.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.994 align:middle line:90%
It's being studied.

00:33:20.994 --> 00:33:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Some of the
applications are going

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:24.891 align:middle line:84%
to be money makers for sure,
into commercial ventures

00:33:24.891 --> 00:33:25.765 align:middle line:90%
and everyone's happy.

00:33:25.765 --> 00:33:27.580 align:middle line:90%
It's win-win, right?

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.310 align:middle line:84%
But let's say in the
classified world,

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:34.109 align:middle line:84%
certain breakthroughs are made
that are really significant.

00:33:34.109 --> 00:33:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's say breakthroughs
that might threaten

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.210 align:middle line:84%
the dominance of the
petroleum industry.

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Because even a
10-year-old looking

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:44.490 align:middle line:84%
at a flying saucer or
these exotic objects,

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:46.540 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
realize that they're not

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.262 align:middle line:90%
using jet fuel or gasoline.

00:33:49.262 --> 00:33:50.970 align:middle line:84%
They're using something
better than that.

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:52.820 align:middle line:84%
whatever that
source of energy is,

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:56.855 align:middle line:84%
whether it's-- some people have
talked about zero-point energy.

00:33:56.855 --> 00:33:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Or even something as relatively
mundane as controlled clean

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:02.776 align:middle line:84%
nuclear fusion, which we do not
yet have, but may happen down

00:34:02.776 --> 00:34:04.590 align:middle line:90%
the road, or something else.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, we're
not using it now.

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And the implication
is very profound

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:14.450 align:middle line:84%
because it would threaten to
unseat the world's largest

00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:14.949 align:middle line:90%
industry.

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:15.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oil.

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:17.891 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And when we look at
oil and all of its subsidiaries,

00:34:17.891 --> 00:34:19.460 align:middle line:84%
that's a really
huge thing to do.

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And so let's say I'm a
scientist working on this

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:24.770 align:middle line:90%
and we figure this out.

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:29.980 align:middle line:84%
You, who might be my boss,
would say, OK, good job.

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:33.380 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to have this one
come out because we're not yet

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:37.190 align:middle line:84%
ready to take down the
petroleum industry.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:39.900 align:middle line:84%
So keep working on it, and
let's see what you got.

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
exactly what's happened.

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:45.570 align:middle line:84%
There's been a tremendous
amount of leaked material

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:47.840 align:middle line:84%
over the years, some
of which I have gotten

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.139 align:middle line:84%
through my own research, that
indicates this is the case.

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:53.800 align:middle line:84%
So if it's the
case, what it looks

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.340 align:middle line:84%
like is that for a
number of years, probably

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:59.820 align:middle line:84%
decades and generations,
the black budget world

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:06.159 align:middle line:84%
has been developing vastly
superior technology.

00:35:06.159 --> 00:35:07.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think about
how science goes.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Back to supercomputing
just as one beginning place.

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, here's
a story I can tell you.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.240 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I include it here.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.670 align:middle line:84%
One of the individuals
that I got to interview

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:middle line:84%
was a former NSA scientist, and
we mentioned the NSA earlier.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:25.700 align:middle line:84%
In the mid '60s, this man was
a civilian engineer for them.

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Just said to me that NSA
computing in 1964, '65,

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:33.730 align:middle line:84%
they had clock speeds
running at 650 megahertz.

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Now, today that's no big deal.

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:35.700 align:middle line:90%
That's chump change today.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but
this was 50 years ago.

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: 1965.

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:41.120 align:middle line:84%
First of all, there were no
personal computers in 1965.

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, the consumer
market did not

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:47.320 align:middle line:84%
reach that clock speed
'til around the year 2000,

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.600 align:middle line:90%
about 35 years later.

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.550 align:middle line:84%
So on that basis, you could
say they were 35 years ahead.

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:53.890 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's just one example.

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:56.162 align:middle line:84%
If you got something
as exotic as ET tech,

00:35:56.162 --> 00:35:57.620 align:middle line:84%
I think we can
assume they're going

00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:02.100 align:middle line:84%
to be even moving
farther ahead as well.

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.600 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk flying saucers.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.420 align:middle line:90%
Homemade craft.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:08.360 align:middle line:84%
There's many, many
reasons to credit

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.090 align:middle line:84%
this idea I think, for example,
the black triangles that

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:14.820 align:middle line:84%
many people are seeing are
such craft that are operating

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.490 align:middle line:84%
on principles we would
call electrogravitics.

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Things that are beyond
our current transportation

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.639 align:middle line:84%
paradigm, our current
energy paradigm.

00:36:23.639 --> 00:36:26.180 align:middle line:84%
But they can't be shared with
the rest of the world, at least

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:29.260 align:middle line:84%
in the opinion of
those guys in charge,

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.755 align:middle line:84%
because it would
be too disruptive.

00:36:30.755 --> 00:36:32.130 align:middle line:84%
So they're working
it themselves.

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:34.213 align:middle line:84%
So here's where a breakaway
civilization comes in.

00:36:34.213 --> 00:36:36.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, ask yourself
what is it that

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:38.871 align:middle line:84%
characterizes a
separate civilization.

00:36:38.871 --> 00:36:40.870 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that
you can really quantify,

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:43.090 align:middle line:90%
but I would say technology.

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:45.860 align:middle line:84%
I would say social
interactions, how

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.130 align:middle line:84%
they interact with
themselves and outsiders.

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:50.250 align:middle line:90%
And I would also say cosmology.

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:53.880 align:middle line:84%
That is, one's understanding
of one's place in the universe

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:54.860 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And I would suggest that within
this deeply classified world,

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.660 align:middle line:84%
and all of those
factors, we are talking

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:03.610 align:middle line:90%
about a separate civilization.

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:05.850 align:middle line:84%
If we were in that
world, for example,

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:09.730 align:middle line:84%
we would have knowledge of
highly exotic propulsion

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:13.090 align:middle line:84%
technology, energy sources and
so forth, which we could not

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:14.420 align:middle line:90%
share with anyone.

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:17.200 align:middle line:84%
We would therefore
probably have technology

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.290 align:middle line:90%
that could take us off planet.

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:22.902 align:middle line:84%
We might in fact have
a lot of knowledge

00:37:22.902 --> 00:37:25.110 align:middle line:84%
that the other people don't
have on the nature of who

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:26.970 align:middle line:90%
these other beings are.

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It might be in
collusion or cooperation

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:29.570 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Sure, yes.

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:33.390 align:middle line:90%
That's very possible in my view.

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:36.040 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
things would give us

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.720 align:middle line:84%
a completely
different worldview.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And imagine how
difficult it might

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.154 align:middle line:84%
be for us to have
family reunions, right?

00:37:43.154 --> 00:37:44.169 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:44.169 --> 00:37:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: A lot of these things.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.540 align:middle line:84%
But I think this is
a real situation.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:49.310 align:middle line:84%
So we would be part
of what I would

00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:51.420 align:middle line:90%
say is a separate civilization.

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:55.940 align:middle line:84%
One that has broken away from
the main civilization, hence

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.420 align:middle line:84%
the phrase breakaway
civilization.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
this is a real part

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:02.805 align:middle line:84%
of the whole
structure of secrecy.

00:38:02.805 --> 00:38:04.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a part of the picture.

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And doesn't
that fold into it

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:09.480 align:middle line:84%
people at very high levels
of government as well?

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.690 align:middle line:90%
It isn't just black ops.

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Theoretically or
supposedly, there

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:17.290 align:middle line:84%
are many high-level
politicos and so forth that

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:19.410 align:middle line:84%
are also included in this
breakaway civilization--

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:21.284 align:middle line:84%
at least have enough
knowledge that they have

00:38:21.284 --> 00:38:24.290 align:middle line:84%
a different view of what their
future holds for them to what

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:26.360 align:middle line:84%
we have for ourselves
at this moment.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.985 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, I
would agree with that.

00:38:27.985 --> 00:38:30.260 align:middle line:84%
I think not all, but
some political leaders--

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:30.884 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Some.

00:38:30.884 --> 00:38:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: --are brought into it.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.260 align:middle line:90%
We have to understand.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:36.730 align:middle line:84%
I think many of the listeners
of Gaiam TV do get this.

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:38.270 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the
rest of the world

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:39.770 align:middle line:84%
really needs to
understand that what

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:45.650 align:middle line:84%
we call our political process
is really just all for show,

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:47.840 align:middle line:84%
and the real power
is behind that.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Does anyone really think
that the US president

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:52.840 align:middle line:90%
is the guy in charge?

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:53.400 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:53.992 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: No.

00:38:53.992 --> 00:38:54.700 align:middle line:90%
We all think that--

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's been awhile.

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: So the other
question is who is behind it?

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.686 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're talking about
financial powers and a lot

00:38:59.686 --> 00:39:01.060 align:middle line:84%
of other things
behind the scenes

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:02.680 align:middle line:90%
who select the president.

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.250 align:middle line:90%
Forget the idea of election.

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Actually, I had
a conversation one evening

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.780 align:middle line:84%
in Laughlin, in Nevada--
this was probably

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:13.757 align:middle line:84%
2001-- with someone
we both know who

00:39:13.757 --> 00:39:15.090 align:middle line:90%
is a highly credible individual.

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:17.424 align:middle line:84%
I think I can say his
name, Daniel Sheehan.

00:39:17.424 --> 00:39:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Oh yes.

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:18.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:19.765 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I know
Daniel very well.

00:39:19.765 --> 00:39:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was
explaining to me

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:23.710 align:middle line:84%
who was going to be the nominee
in the next presidential

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:24.380 align:middle line:90%
election.

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:26.690 align:middle line:90%
This was three years out.

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:27.810 align:middle line:90%
And he was right on.

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:28.580 align:middle line:90%
He told me why.

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.290 align:middle line:90%
He said this is what happened.

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:32.510 align:middle line:84%
When Gore made the decision
he made on his vice

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:34.910 align:middle line:84%
presidential running
mate, he basically

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:36.480 align:middle line:90%
went against the system.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.102 align:middle line:90%
He's out.

00:39:37.102 --> 00:39:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Nothing will ever
come of that man.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.270 align:middle line:90%
He's finished.

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.891 align:middle line:90%
He's toast.

00:39:39.891 --> 00:39:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And then he told
me that Kerry would

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:42.890 align:middle line:84%
be the nominee in
the next election.

00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:45.190 align:middle line:84%
I said, Daniel, that's
three years from now.

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:47.740 align:middle line:84%
He said, my dear, you
don't think people actually

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.610 align:middle line:84%
have a choice in
this stuff, do you?

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And that was my
education the first time

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.366 align:middle line:90%
in how things really work.

00:39:53.366 --> 00:39:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Kerry seemingly
came out of nowhere.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He seemingly
came out of nowhere.

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:58.213 align:middle line:84%
But no, he had been
groomed all along.

00:39:58.213 --> 00:40:01.294 align:middle line:84%
He was supposed to be the vice
presidential choice of Gore.

00:40:01.294 --> 00:40:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And then things might have
done differently for Gore also.

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, that's
quite interesting indeed.

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.246 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is interesting.

00:40:06.246 --> 00:40:08.310 align:middle line:90%
So that's when I-- yeah.

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:10.581 align:middle line:84%
I was no longer naive
about politics after that.

00:40:10.581 --> 00:40:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: You know, with Kerry
and Bush in '04, I said, well,

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.540 align:middle line:90%
you've got skull versus bones.

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:15.347 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:15.347 --> 00:40:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: They're
both Skull and Bones.

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: They're both
part of the same club.

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Did it really matter
who's going to get in?

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right.So
we know that there

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:21.987 align:middle line:90%
are handlers beyond all of this.

00:40:21.987 --> 00:40:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And these are people
that are included

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:25.870 align:middle line:84%
in what you call this
breakaway civilization.

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
about technologies

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:30.550 align:middle line:90%
that I've seen the drawings for.

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Mark McCandlish, I think you
write about him in your book.

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:33.954 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes, indeed.

00:40:33.954 --> 00:40:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I had
seen his presentations.

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:37.580 align:middle line:84%
I've seen his
drawings, and what he

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:39.770 align:middle line:84%
had witnessed by
way of what appears

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:42.130 align:middle line:84%
to be alien craft that
is made in the USA.

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:43.420 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Important story.

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:46.589 align:middle line:84%
Now, Mark is a
aerospace illustrator.

00:40:46.589 --> 00:40:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:48.755 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: He's a first
rate illustrator.

00:40:48.755 --> 00:40:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And had a very close
friend who was also

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:52.830 align:middle line:84%
in the aerospace
industry, smart guy.

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And they were going to go
to an air show together.

00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:56.675 align:middle line:84%
Mark couldn't do it
at the last minute.

00:40:56.675 --> 00:40:58.330 align:middle line:90%
He had a deadline to write.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So this guy went with a powerful
friend, a friend of his family.

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:03.780 align:middle line:90%
Top-level guy.

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:05.404 align:middle line:84%
We've never known
his name to this day.

00:41:05.404 --> 00:41:07.580 align:middle line:90%
But up, up, up, up high level.

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:12.304 align:middle line:84%
So they go to an
air show at the--

00:41:12.304 --> 00:41:13.970 align:middle line:84%
what was going to be
at Norton Airfield.

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And they actually took
up a private flight

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:18.800 align:middle line:84%
to Lockheed's Helendale
facility where,

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.650 align:middle line:84%
according to this friend, who
described in detail to Mark,

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:27.540 align:middle line:84%
saw, among other things,
three hovering-- well,

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:29.620 align:middle line:84%
they looked like flying
saucers in a huge hangar

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.730 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of guys
with M-16 machine guns.

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And a general, a
four-star general,

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:38.010 align:middle line:84%
at a display discussing
these and referring to them

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:41.260 align:middle line:84%
as the Alien
Reproduction Vehicles,

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:44.510 align:middle line:84%
ARVs, describing how
they had actually

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:46.490 align:middle line:84%
gone throughout the
solar system by then.

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:48.067 align:middle line:90%
This is 1988.

00:41:48.067 --> 00:41:48.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:49.309 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: 1988.

00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:49.934 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:49.934 --> 00:41:50.912 align:middle line:90%
25 years ago, nearly.

00:41:50.912 --> 00:41:51.828 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's right.

00:41:51.828 --> 00:41:53.590 align:middle line:84%
That air show was
held, it's believed,

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:56.610 align:middle line:84%
because George Bush had
just been elected president.

00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:57.840 align:middle line:90%
It was against Dukakis.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.965 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very interesting.

00:41:58.965 --> 00:41:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And they had
a reason, they felt,

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:00.100 align:middle line:90%
that they could do this.

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
found it fascinating

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.093 align:middle line:84%
because he was such a
top notch illustrator,

00:42:03.093 --> 00:42:05.830 align:middle line:84%
he was able to come back and
he memorized every feature

00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:07.960 align:middle line:84%
he could, captured
that, and then of course

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.630 align:middle line:90%
he later was sharing that.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:11.890 align:middle line:84%
By the time the Disclosure
Project came around,

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:13.260 align:middle line:90%
he was going public about it.

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's correct.

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now with all
of this, everything

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:18.780 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking
about, still most people

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:22.889 align:middle line:90%
think that this is fairy tales.

00:42:22.889 --> 00:42:23.680 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah, or--

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I mean,
a lot of people do

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.581 align:middle line:84%
think there are probably
are other civilizations,

00:42:26.581 --> 00:42:29.360 align:middle line:84%
but that a lot of the
sightings are fairy tales,

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.080 align:middle line:84%
that they're doctored
video, that they're

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.840 align:middle line:90%
doctored film, and so forth.

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.940 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is there has
been a very concerted effort

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:37.607 align:middle line:84%
to see to it that we
all feel that way.

00:42:37.607 --> 00:42:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Absolutely.

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That we all
giggle this one down.

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:42.336 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to read from your
book, if you don't mind.

00:42:42.336 --> 00:42:47.240 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about
some of the news and media

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:51.962 align:middle line:84%
outlets that are completely
run by Intelligence.

00:42:51.962 --> 00:42:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Exactly.

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you
mind if I go ahead?

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:54.266 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Please.

00:42:54.266 --> 00:42:55.641 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It says--
and I'll read

00:42:55.641 --> 00:42:57.099 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning
of the paragraph--

00:42:57.099 --> 00:42:59.540 align:middle line:84%
"Even a partial list of the

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:20.612 align:middle line:90%
and publishing houses overseas."

00:43:20.612 --> 00:43:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Exactly.

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:22.028 align:middle line:90%
And that refers--

00:43:22.028 --> 00:43:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's why we
don't know what's going on.

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:29.010 align:middle line:84%
In 1977, the journalist Carl
Bernstein of Watergate fame--

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:31.480 align:middle line:84%
he was one of the
Watergate investigators--

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:33.320 align:middle line:84%
did a scoop for
Rolling Stone magazine

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:36.580 align:middle line:84%
in which he described how
the CIA-- and this was

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:41.330 align:middle line:84%
a conservative estimate by him--
the CIA had employed secretly

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:43.960 align:middle line:84%
at least 400
American journalists,

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:47.990 align:middle line:84%
top-level journalists,
through the 1940s,

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:50.980 align:middle line:84%
'50s, and '60s, the
Cold War era, who

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:54.940 align:middle line:84%
were working for the CIA
without anybody else knowing.

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And what that meant
was they took it

00:43:58.330 --> 00:44:02.870 align:middle line:84%
on as patriotic Americans in
the context of the Cold War.

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:06.266 align:middle line:84%
And the CIA then said, well, we
weren't controlling the news.

00:44:06.266 --> 00:44:07.640 align:middle line:84%
But think about
what you could do

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:13.630 align:middle line:84%
or what I could do if we had
400 journalists at the highest

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:17.744 align:middle line:84%
levels of America's media
working for us covertly.

00:44:17.744 --> 00:44:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Could we control everything?

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:19.410 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not.

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:20.618 align:middle line:90%
But could we influence a lot?

00:44:20.618 --> 00:44:21.120 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.730 align:middle line:90%
Could we kill certain stories?

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:24.034 align:middle line:90%
Could we promote other stories?

00:44:24.034 --> 00:44:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Could we even put
in fake stories?

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:26.130 align:middle line:90%
All of that.

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:27.480 align:middle line:10%
And all of that happened.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:32.840 align:middle line:10%
So Bernstein came out with
this article in 1977, OK?

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:35.222 align:middle line:10%
And the CIA said,
well, that's true,

00:44:35.222 --> 00:44:36.430 align:middle line:10%
but we don't do that anymore.

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:38.210 align:middle line:10%
But they said was
like a lawyer would

00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:41.510 align:middle line:10%
say-- we do not engage
in those types of paid

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:43.850 align:middle line:10%
relationships with
journalists anymore.

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:44.820 align:middle line:90%
So really, they--

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:45.110 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:45.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Anymore.

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.050 align:middle line:90%
Anymore was the operative word.

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:48.460 align:middle line:84%
At least they
admitted that much.

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:50.584 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: The way it is
today is they don't need it.

00:44:50.584 --> 00:44:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Journalists jump over each
other to have a relationship

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:54.850 align:middle line:84%
with the CIA for
military intelligence.

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:55.430 align:middle line:90%
They all do.

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:56.720 align:middle line:90%
It's a career maker.

00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:00.180 align:middle line:84%
So the US national
security community

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:04.557 align:middle line:90%
dominates America's media.

00:45:04.557 --> 00:45:05.390 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's tragic.

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is really
critical for everyone

00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:07.020 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:07.430 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes.

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I can give you
one personal example.

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:12.780 align:middle line:84%
When I was a young anchorwoman
doing the nightly news,

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:14.850 align:middle line:84%
I remember one time
I was looking at,

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:16.650 align:middle line:90%
I think it was Associated Press.

00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And a story had come over
about a sighting in Europe

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.640 align:middle line:90%
that had come through Reuters.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
that's so exciting.

00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Many, many witnesses to
this, and including local law

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:29.080 align:middle line:90%
enforcement and so forth.

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.490 align:middle line:84%
I thought, we
should put this in.

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:31.531 align:middle line:90%
Now, this was awhile ago.

00:45:31.531 --> 00:45:33.620 align:middle line:84%
This is the early
'80s, mid '80s.

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was told, you're
not putting that in.

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:37.980 align:middle line:90%
We don't do those stories.

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:38.646 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Really?

00:45:38.646 --> 00:45:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that was at
a-- just a local news anchor.

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: They said
no UFO stories?

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:44.960 align:middle line:90%
We don't do those stories.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah.

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:49.020 align:middle line:84%
This is very, very typical
within journalistic culture.

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:52.630 align:middle line:84%
It could be that there was an
explicit order from on high.

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:54.804 align:middle line:84%
But it could also be that
the news director learned.

00:45:54.804 --> 00:45:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He just didn't
want to-- yeah, he learned.

00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:59.272 align:middle line:84%
And also you have
issues with sponsors--

00:45:59.272 --> 00:46:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Can't get any.

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --pulling
their ads from your show

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:05.391 align:middle line:84%
if you should do anything that
has a giggle factor associated

00:46:05.391 --> 00:46:05.890 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:06.345 align:middle line:90%
It could be that.

00:46:06.345 --> 00:46:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: But the way
it's always worked

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:10.020 align:middle line:84%
is-- and there's been some
very good academic studies

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:12.925 align:middle line:84%
on this topic, of how
the CIA has influenced

00:46:12.925 --> 00:46:16.200 align:middle line:84%
the American academic community
and the American media.

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And the way that they do it,
let's think about academia.

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:20.260 align:middle line:90%
Simple.

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:23.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not that they control
every professor, of course.

00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:25.800 align:middle line:84%
But they will have relationships
with the big shots,

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:29.070 align:middle line:84%
like the people at Harvard and
Yale and UCLA and so forth.

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:33.600 align:middle line:84%
So if some minor person
at some other school

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:36.530 align:middle line:84%
gets this idea to research
UFOs, well then, sure.

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:39.600 align:middle line:84%
One of the big dogs at Harvard
will just smack it right down.

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And that is exactly
how it's happened.

00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:44.710 align:middle line:84%
So you create this culture
within the academic world

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:46.780 align:middle line:84%
and within the
journalistic world, where

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.520 align:middle line:84%
UFOs become the third
rail of your career.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And smart people who
want to a good career,

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:53.120 align:middle line:90%
they learn this lesson.

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And they internalize
this so that it really

00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.450 align:middle line:84%
becomes almost
self-policing after awhile.

00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:02.285 align:middle line:84%
It becomes part of the
culture of those institutions.

00:47:02.285 --> 00:47:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And since you
brought up Harvard,

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.440 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to spend just a few
minutes looking at John Mack's

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.800 align:middle line:84%
part because we both have
a great fondness-- I think

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:14.010 align:middle line:84%
everyone had a great fondness
and respect for Dr. John Mack.

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you'll tell us a little
bit about his background

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.718 align:middle line:84%
and what his part
in the story was.

00:47:17.718 --> 00:47:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: John Mac was a
Pulitzer Prize-winning author

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:24.555 align:middle line:84%
and a professional psychologist
at Harvard University.

00:47:24.555 --> 00:47:26.850 align:middle line:90%
He was internationally renowned.

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Who, in the late 1980s,
quietly started becoming

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:34.800 align:middle line:84%
intrigued by reports of
alleged alien abduction.

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, I mean, people talk
about UFOs being fringe.

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:41.544 align:middle line:84%
Well, within that, abductions
are even more fringy as far

00:47:41.544 --> 00:47:42.335 align:middle line:90%
as mainstream goes.

00:47:42.335 --> 00:47:45.810 align:middle line:84%
But John Mack took it
seriously and just wanted

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:48.420 align:middle line:90%
to know what was going on here.

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:50.129 align:middle line:84%
Why would so many
people have this claim?

00:47:50.129 --> 00:47:52.211 align:middle line:84%
Was there something to it
or not and and so forth.

00:47:52.211 --> 00:47:53.890 align:middle line:84%
So he began quietly
looking into it.

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:56.270 align:middle line:90%
By the early '90s, he was out.

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:57.370 align:middle line:90%
He was out there.

00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And what Harvard
University tried to do

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:01.270 align:middle line:90%
was, well, destroy him.

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:03.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they literally
tried to destroy his career.

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.480 align:middle line:84%
They tried to strip
him of tenure.

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.942 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's where Danny
Sheehan comes back in again.

00:48:07.942 --> 00:48:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Danny Sheehan.

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:12.294 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who had four, I think,
doctorate degrees, a master's

00:48:12.294 --> 00:48:13.710 align:middle line:84%
and three doctorates
from Harvard.

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Danny's an
extraordinary guy.

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's extraordinary.

00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:17.480 align:middle line:84%
He sued the university
on John's behalf.

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And he succeeded
in defending John.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.516 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, he did.

00:48:20.516 --> 00:48:24.135 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And John Mack retained
his position at Harvard

00:48:24.135 --> 00:48:27.620 align:middle line:84%
until his death in the
early 21st century.

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:31.640 align:middle line:84%
So yes, but John Mack was
the target of a vociferous,

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.910 align:middle line:84%
really virulent, violent
campaign against him.

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Not just by Harvard, but by
the entire American media.

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.782 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Newsweek and Time
ridiculed him on and on and on.

00:48:41.782 --> 00:48:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:42.895 align:middle line:90%
It was horrible.

00:48:42.895 --> 00:48:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And John Mack, I
had the honor and pleasure

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:46.910 align:middle line:90%
of meeting him one time.

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:51.470 align:middle line:84%
I was one of the new guys
in ufology at the time.

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:53.595 align:middle line:84%
I've read his books and I
know many of his friends,

00:48:53.595 --> 00:48:54.719 align:middle line:90%
and I've seen him on video.

00:48:54.719 --> 00:48:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And you can see with
John Mack that this

00:48:56.490 --> 00:48:59.980 align:middle line:84%
was a brilliant man who
was also a good man.

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:01.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was modest.

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:02.379 align:middle line:90%
He was a gentleman.

00:49:02.379 --> 00:49:03.920 align:middle line:84%
I met him also in
a couple occasions.

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Probably we were circling
around each other at that time.

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And very,
a deep thinker.

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Amazing.

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yeah.

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:08.850 align:middle line:90%
Serious about it.

00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:09.475 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:09.475 --> 00:49:10.730 align:middle line:90%
He took it very seriously.

00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:12.063 align:middle line:90%
He was respectful of the people.

00:49:12.063 --> 00:49:13.870 align:middle line:84%
He did not want to go
into that initially.

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:16.078 align:middle line:84%
He was kind of cajoled into
it and thought all right,

00:49:16.078 --> 00:49:17.420 align:middle line:90%
I'll take a look at it.

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:18.290 align:middle line:90%
And there you go.

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:19.060 align:middle line:90%
He said yes.

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And there were common themes
coming up in these stories.

00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:24.190 align:middle line:90%
And not all of it was negative.

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:25.890 align:middle line:90%
I just want to cap that off.

00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Not all of these abductee
experiences were 100% negative.

00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Some of them had
this incredible sense

00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:32.740 align:middle line:90%
of opening in awe and so forth.

00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: John Mack really
pioneered the whole idea

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:37.170 align:middle line:84%
of abductions as--
because one thing

00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:39.870 align:middle line:84%
he noticed among
abductees, even when

00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:42.630 align:middle line:84%
they had a traumatic
experience-- now,

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:44.280 align:middle line:90%
it has to be said.

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:47.880 align:middle line:84%
A number of abductees
really have been seemingly

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.050 align:middle line:84%
very negatively affected
by what happened.

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: I know a number
of individuals where,

00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:53.830 align:middle line:84%
psychologically,
it didn't go well.

00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:54.901 align:middle line:90%
Not with everyone.

00:49:54.901 --> 00:49:55.400 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that John noticed
is that these experiences often

00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:02.230 align:middle line:84%
seem to trigger
transformative experiences

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:04.070 align:middle line:90%
in these individuals.

00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:05.599 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
enhanced abilities.

00:50:05.599 --> 00:50:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes.

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Enhanced abilities
intellectually, psychically,

00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:11.860 align:middle line:84%
and artistically,
and in every way.

00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:13.133 align:middle line:90%
Mathematically.

00:50:13.133 --> 00:50:15.290 align:middle line:90%
This has happened quite a lot.

00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:18.030 align:middle line:84%
So it was something
that he noted.

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And his attitude was there's
something happening here

00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:25.120 align:middle line:90%
that may not all be negative.

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:26.935 align:middle line:84%
Now, other of his
colleagues that he

00:50:26.935 --> 00:50:28.810 align:middle line:84%
was very close to-- Bud
Hopkins, for example,

00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:31.297 align:middle line:84%
who also recently
died, pointed out.

00:50:31.297 --> 00:50:32.380 align:middle line:90%
He said, well, look, John.

00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:36.370 align:middle line:84%
If the ETs are doing these
transformative experiences,

00:50:36.370 --> 00:50:39.650 align:middle line:84%
these guys didn't know
about it until you

00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:41.776 align:middle line:90%
started doing the regression.

00:50:41.776 --> 00:50:43.150 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, it
wasn't the ETs.

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:44.871 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was you who
was helping them.

00:50:44.871 --> 00:50:47.120 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, there's different
ways of looking at this.

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:47.786 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:47.786 --> 00:50:49.380 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: But John's
conclusion was

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:51.990 align:middle line:84%
that it wasn't all
of a negative thing.

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And that by going through
this type of transformation,

00:50:56.130 --> 00:50:57.600 align:middle line:90%
good things were happening.

00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And it has to also be said that
when you look at the abduction

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:04.750 align:middle line:84%
experience, the way that
many people described it,

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:06.180 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't like the
ETs were trying

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:07.615 align:middle line:84%
to be jerks about
it necessarily.

00:51:07.615 --> 00:51:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Right.

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.240 align:middle line:90%
They were functionaries.

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:11.864 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: They were doing things
that people found-- I mean,

00:51:11.864 --> 00:51:12.655 align:middle line:90%
they were helpless.

00:51:12.655 --> 00:51:14.180 align:middle line:90%
It was humiliating.

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.097 align:middle line:90%
It was traumatic.

00:51:16.097 --> 00:51:18.305 align:middle line:84%
But there might be different
ways of interpreting it.

00:51:18.305 --> 00:51:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's what John
Mack tried to do.

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:21.198 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
a beautiful job.

00:51:21.198 --> 00:51:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was very sad
the way that all ended.

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:26.985 align:middle line:84%
But in any event, at least we
have his books for the record.

00:51:26.985 --> 00:51:28.610 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to
bring that piece up

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:30.150 align:middle line:84%
because it is an
important piece of it.

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.691 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes.

00:51:30.691 --> 00:51:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's go
forward, because we have not

00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:36.010 align:middle line:84%
gotten to the "A.D." portion
of this conversation.

00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Well, that's right.

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:39.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we only have
maybe 5 or 10 minutes left.

00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:43.880 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how you see
with this-- with your partner,

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:46.440 align:middle line:84%
how you see this playing
out in the future.

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:47.710 align:middle line:90%
The most likely scenario.

00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:49.084 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: The
adventure of writing

00:51:49.084 --> 00:51:53.380 align:middle line:84%
"A.D." was-- what we realized
is how profoundly our society is

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:55.250 align:middle line:84%
likely to be affected
by disclosure.

00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:56.580 align:middle line:90%
So let's say an event happens.

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:58.630 align:middle line:84%
The president is forced
to make a statement.

00:51:58.630 --> 00:52:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, you got a lot of things
coming up right off the bat.

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:06.500 align:middle line:84%
First of all, some people
won't panic, some people will.

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:07.690 align:middle line:90%
That's just human nature.

00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:08.810 align:middle line:90%
Some people will.

00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:10.270 align:middle line:90%
So there'll be a lot of fear.

00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:11.990 align:middle line:84%
People will want to
know are we safe.

00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:13.410 align:middle line:84%
There'll be all
of these questions

00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:14.890 align:middle line:84%
about who these
other beings are.

00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And that may not
be an easy thing

00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:20.510 align:middle line:84%
for a president or a
political leader to get into.

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:23.786 align:middle line:84%
But one question that will
come up very quickly, I think,

00:52:23.786 --> 00:52:25.710 align:middle line:84%
will all be this
political blowback.

00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:28.650 align:middle line:84%
People will want to
know, wait a minute,

00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:30.510 align:middle line:84%
if this is real,
how the heck have

00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:32.180 align:middle line:84%
you kept this secret
all these years?

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:36.160 align:middle line:84%
You've been lying
to us for 70 years.

00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Some people who have a
dog-like obedience to authority

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:40.440 align:middle line:90%
will not care.

00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:43.139 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, well, the
president did what he had to do.

00:52:43.139 --> 00:52:45.180 align:middle line:84%
But not everyone's going
to take this lying down.

00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
want to know, how did you

00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:49.180 align:middle line:84%
manipulate our media
all these years?

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:51.630 align:middle line:84%
How did you manipulate
our academic institutions

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:53.440 align:middle line:90%
and our political institutions?

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And there's going to be
a lot of investigation

00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:58.370 align:middle line:90%
into this black budget culture.

00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:00.470 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be
investigations, I believe,

00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:03.240 align:middle line:84%
that will lead to this
breakaway civilization.

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Once this is out on the table
as a valid topic of discourse,

00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:10.040 align:middle line:84%
it's really going to be
impossible to close that barn

00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:10.820 align:middle line:90%
door.

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:12.470 align:middle line:90%
The horse is out.

00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And the question will then
be, how much information

00:53:16.690 --> 00:53:17.725 align:middle line:90%
is given out?

00:53:17.725 --> 00:53:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's not going
to be an easy thing

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.692 align:middle line:84%
because you'll have
the secret keepers.

00:53:22.692 --> 00:53:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Yhey're not just
going to walk away

00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:26.940 align:middle line:84%
from the table after all these
years of investing themselves

00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:27.524 align:middle line:90%
in the secret.

00:53:27.524 --> 00:53:29.273 align:middle line:84%
They're going to want
to control the spin.

00:53:29.273 --> 00:53:31.420 align:middle line:84%
But the problem will be--
think of the Arab Spring.

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Think of the Occupy
Wall Street phenomenon.

00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:36.840 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have a
lot of energized people.

00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:38.419 align:middle line:90%
And they're going to be angry.

00:53:38.419 --> 00:53:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
have this battle.

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.501 align:middle line:84%
And the political
leadership is going

00:53:41.501 --> 00:53:43.680 align:middle line:84%
to be caught in the
middle between keeping

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:46.570 align:middle line:84%
the brakes on this and
responding somewhat

00:53:46.570 --> 00:53:48.360 align:middle line:90%
to the people.

00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Wackenhut Security might be
able to stop 10 or 20 people

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.880 align:middle line:84%
from occupying Area 51, but
can they stop a million?

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:56.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:53:56.050 --> 00:54:00.490 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there's going
to be a lot of energized people.

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And how that will all work
out, no one can predict.

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:04.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:06.460 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's going
to be one important thing.

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:10.350 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be a
massive democratic movement.

00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:11.830 align:middle line:90%
But that's only the beginning.

00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:15.820 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have a
culture-- think of the 1960s,

00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:20.650 align:middle line:84%
where people rebelled
against decades and lifetimes

00:54:20.650 --> 00:54:25.620 align:middle line:84%
worth of cultural norms in favor
of let's create something new.

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:28.600 align:middle line:84%
I think that's going to happen
again with high technology.

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:31.730 align:middle line:84%
The drugs will be there, too,
the hallucinogenics-- DMT,

00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:33.170 align:middle line:90%
ayahuasca.

00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:35.580 align:middle line:84%
This is already true
in the UFO subcultures,

00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:39.040 align:middle line:84%
where the belief is you
take some of these drugs

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:42.074 align:middle line:84%
and it will open you up to these
other dimensions of reality.

00:54:42.074 --> 00:54:43.490 align:middle line:84%
You think that's
going to go away?

00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:45.240 align:middle line:90%
That will be enhanced.

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.570 align:middle line:90%
That will be very important.

00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:49.330 align:middle line:84%
There'll be this whole
culture of people

00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:54.214 align:middle line:84%
who will say the old
way was based on lies,

00:54:54.214 --> 00:54:55.880 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
create something new.

00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:57.890 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
there'll be the old guard,

00:54:57.890 --> 00:54:59.630 align:middle line:90%
the old conservatives.

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And we'll have major
cultural divide here.

00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And all of this is
independent of what we learn,

00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:07.386 align:middle line:84%
who these other
beings are anyway.

00:55:07.386 --> 00:55:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
an important one

00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:13.687 align:middle line:84%
because we talked about this
off camera a little bit.

00:55:13.687 --> 00:55:15.770 align:middle line:84%
The thinking is, they're
no different than we are.

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:17.436 align:middle line:84%
There are many different
types of beings

00:55:17.436 --> 00:55:19.660 align:middle line:84%
who may have been
here, and visiting here

00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:21.110 align:middle line:90%
throughout the ages.

00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And some may have more of a
negative agenda, you might say.

00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:28.707 align:middle line:84%
Maybe something a little
more exploitative.

00:55:28.707 --> 00:55:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what a
lot of the people who've

00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:32.530 align:middle line:84%
gone through alien
abductions feel that.

00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:35.310 align:middle line:84%
That it is more exploitative,
looking for DNA.

00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And you can argue, what
do we do to lab animals?

00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:40.177 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we do the same thing.

00:55:40.177 --> 00:55:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
other civilizations

00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:43.718 align:middle line:84%
who are considered to be
maybe more benevolent.

00:55:43.718 --> 00:55:46.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they say hey,
nothing's happened to us yet.

00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:50.530 align:middle line:84%
But there's a difference there
in terms of a prime directive,

00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:52.770 align:middle line:84%
of leave a developing
species alone.

00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:54.740 align:middle line:84%
So kind of a hands-off
approach there.

00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:56.050 align:middle line:90%
How do you see all this?

00:55:56.050 --> 00:55:57.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, this is
going to be a big mess.

00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:59.320 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a big,
fat mess, because we

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:00.660 align:middle line:84%
may get to the
point of disclosure

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:02.270 align:middle line:84%
where we can prove
that they're here,

00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:03.460 align:middle line:84%
but we may not get
to the point where

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:04.910 align:middle line:84%
we can grab one of these
beings and put them

00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:06.397 align:middle line:84%
at a podium next
to the president.

00:56:06.397 --> 00:56:08.480 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to be at a
very intermediary stage.

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be unsatisfactory,
where there'll

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:13.140 align:middle line:84%
be a lot of room
for argument here.

00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:17.590 align:middle line:84%
In my own judgment,
there are multiple groups

00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:19.580 align:middle line:90%
with multiple agendas.

00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, sorting
all of this out.

00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Knowing are we
going to get truth

00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:26.209 align:middle line:84%
from our political
leaders on this.

00:56:26.209 --> 00:56:28.125 align:middle line:84%
This is going to take a
long, long, long time.

00:56:28.125 --> 00:56:28.825 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:56:28.825 --> 00:56:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: And it will not be
the easiest thing to sort out.

00:56:31.290 --> 00:56:33.250 align:middle line:90%
I do think ultimately it will.

00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:36.930 align:middle line:84%
But disclosure, you see,
is not the ultimate answer.

00:56:36.930 --> 00:56:40.970 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the
beginning of a new phase

00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:42.852 align:middle line:90%
in the struggle for truth.

00:56:42.852 --> 00:56:44.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I couldn't
agree with you more.

00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And I really have to applaud
you for-- you put yourself

00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:48.690 align:middle line:90%
on the line.

00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Talk about being
subject to ridicule.

00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who's taken this
on up to this point

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:54.800 align:middle line:90%
has been subject to ridicule.

00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:57.244 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, you always come
out smelling like roses,

00:56:57.244 --> 00:56:59.035 align:middle line:84%
and it's because you've
done your homework.

00:56:59.035 --> 00:57:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: I try to be careful.

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:00.492 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You do.

00:57:00.492 --> 00:57:01.350 align:middle line:90%
You try to be careful.

00:57:01.350 --> 00:57:02.683 align:middle line:90%
But you have done your homework.

00:57:02.683 --> 00:57:04.652 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly
encourage anybody

00:57:04.652 --> 00:57:06.110 align:middle line:84%
that is interested
in this subject,

00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:09.960 align:middle line:84%
you got to pick up a copy
of "A.D. After Disclosure."

00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:12.382 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, I want to thank
you so much for your time,

00:57:12.382 --> 00:57:14.340 align:middle line:84%
and for your energy, and
for all your hard work

00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:15.360 align:middle line:90%
and research, Richard.

00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:16.780 align:middle line:84%
It's been a pleasure
being here with you.

00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Same here, Regina.

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:18.160 align:middle line:90%
I've loved it.

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:18.924 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:18.924 --> 00:57:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: However we choose
to relate to this information,

00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:23.589 align:middle line:84%
there is no doubt that a
great deal of time, planning,

00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:26.190 align:middle line:84%
and human resources have gone
into seeing that we do not

00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:27.660 align:middle line:90%
ask too many questions.

00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, that
if we do or if we

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:32.270 align:middle line:84%
should have our own experience,
we're made to look foolish.

00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:35.070 align:middle line:84%
My hope is that after today,
some of the giggle factor

00:57:35.070 --> 00:57:37.640 align:middle line:84%
will have been released
surrounding this object.

00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:38.620 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
us here on Gaiam TV.
