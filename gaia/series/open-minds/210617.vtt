Sumerian story is interesting

00:00:11.767 --> 00:00:13.590 align:middle line:84%
because there's
different chapters that

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.590 align:middle line:84%
seem to go back more than
12,000, more than 50,000,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.513 align:middle line:84%
maybe more than
100,000 years ago.

>>BILLY CARSON: It's not that we
came out of only Adam and Eve--

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.980 align:middle line:90%
two people--

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.560 align:middle line:84%
because if you
end-read like that,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.780 align:middle line:84%
we already know what's
going to happen.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Right.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.980 align:middle line:90%
We'd out-breed pretty fast.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: He cracked a
code that has not been

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.650 align:middle line:90%
cracked in over 1,000 years.

If you were going to envision
an alien-like language,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.220 align:middle line:90%
this is the one.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.410 align:middle line:90%
It uses simply symbols.

>>CARSON: Chromosome number
two was spliced and fused

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and two telomere caps
were put on them.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.060 align:middle line:84%
They're estimating it
happened about when?

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.758 align:middle line:90%
200,000 years ago.

00:00:46.758 --> 00:00:48.300 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
figuring out what

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.130 align:middle line:84%
happened so we can
correct what happened

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.470 align:middle line:84%
in the past for the future
because the past is prologue.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.190 align:middle line:84%

they may want to sell us time.

They're calling this new
book "The Epic of Humanity,"

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:84%
a time capsule of
human knowledge.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.990 align:middle line:10%
And looking at the timeline,
it really is a time capsule.

>>LACROIX: Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:29.957 --> 00:01:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about what--

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.900 align:middle line:84%
two years so far in
doing this project?

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yes.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.495 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why are
you doing this?

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:39.290 align:middle line:84%
What is it that you're trying
to bring forth to humanity

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.890 align:middle line:84%
at this time that hasn't
already been done?

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.040 align:middle line:10%
>>LACROIX: Two years ago,
Billy and I actually met up

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.510 align:middle line:10%
when I was living in Maine.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.700 align:middle line:10%
And we went out and we
went for some walks.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.200 align:middle line:10%
And we were discussing
what we could

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.398 align:middle line:10%
do in the future, some
kind of a different kind

00:01:53.398 --> 00:01:55.940 align:middle line:10%
of collaboration, something that
hasn't really been done yet.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.770 align:middle line:10%
And we came up with
this idea of what

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.930 align:middle line:10%
if we write a book
that is about just

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.780 align:middle line:10%
our entire story
from where it began,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.800 align:middle line:10%
not from the pre-Homo sapien
and more of a Neanderthal.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.770 align:middle line:84%
But more of when did
Homo sapiens sapiens,

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.780 align:middle line:84%
and civilization
from that point,

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.790 align:middle line:84%
up to where we are
and then the future--

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.200 align:middle line:90%
what is that story?

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And what is that story based on
as much evidence as possible,

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.010 align:middle line:84%
as many ancient texts
around the world?

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Can we take all
of this and put it

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.300 align:middle line:84%
into this cohesive,
chronological book

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.880 align:middle line:84%
that really tells this
story that we really

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.420 align:middle line:90%
haven't been taught?

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Billy?

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.755 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Same thing?

00:02:32.755 --> 00:02:34.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what was your
motivation for doing this,

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.760 align:middle line:84%
because we're not going
to get into the other kind

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.710 align:middle line:84%
of esoteric overlays to it
because it's just too much.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.177 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can't get
into all the stories

00:02:43.177 --> 00:02:45.298 align:middle line:84%
about where all these
different beings came from

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:46.340 align:middle line:90%
and who are the Anunnaki.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.257 align:middle line:90%
We're not going there.

00:02:47.257 --> 00:02:51.710 align:middle line:10%
But we're going over what is
validated, verified history

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.950 align:middle line:10%
in a new way, right?

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.300 align:middle line:10%
And so Matt is
probably, for me, one

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.165 align:middle line:10%
of the most respected
people in the area

00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:01.040 align:middle line:10%
of ancient civilizations
and ancient history,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.370 align:middle line:10%
and a person that I respect for
actually reading the tablets,

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:10%
going through the ancient
texts, the cylinder scrolls,

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.058 align:middle line:10%
scriptures, papyruses,
and everything else,

00:03:09.058 --> 00:03:10.850 align:middle line:10%
digging deep into that,
because many people

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.410 align:middle line:10%
claim to be experts, but they
never actually do the research.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.470 align:middle line:84%
They won't even
touch those tablets.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And so myself and
Matt are probably

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.553 align:middle line:84%
one of the very few people that
actually really have dug deep.

00:03:19.553 --> 00:03:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that he can help
me bring forward this story.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that
our collaborations

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.140 align:middle line:84%
that we had done previously
on just YouTube and podcasts

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.150 align:middle line:84%
were so great, people
really loved this,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.920 align:middle line:84%
that if we got together
and did a book,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:84%
we can really put this
story out in a way

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.210 align:middle line:84%
that people could
understand it and digest it.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.725 align:middle line:90%
Well, congratulations, guys.

00:03:37.725 --> 00:03:38.600 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Thank you.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.308 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So now let's
dig into the story

00:03:40.308 --> 00:03:42.560 align:middle line:10%
because we're talking
about, essentially,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.200 align:middle line:10%
creating a timeline that
changes our understanding of who

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.690 align:middle line:10%
we are, what humanity
is, as you say,

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.790 align:middle line:10%
Homo sapiens, sapiens, right?

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.480 align:middle line:10%
So where do we begin?

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.280 align:middle line:90%
Let's start.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.057 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well,
I guess the place

00:03:54.057 --> 00:03:57.440 align:middle line:84%
to start is that we have to
understand where it started

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.340 align:middle line:90%
and when it started.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.248 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: That's
really what comes

00:04:00.248 --> 00:04:03.470 align:middle line:84%
into are we-- is our story of
human civilizations emerging

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.110 align:middle line:84%
out of the Fertile Crescent
only 6,000 years old

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.720 align:middle line:84%
or is there a completely
other set of chapters

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.070 align:middle line:90%
that go before that?

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's what-- the goal of
this book is not only to tell

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.010 align:middle line:84%
the story and provide the
evidence, but provide--

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.610 align:middle line:84%
have as many ancient texts
and pieces of ancient texts

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.680 align:middle line:84%
that have the most important
information all in one place.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And that really was
the goal of this

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.310 align:middle line:84%
is to be this almost like
I guess you could call it

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.150 align:middle line:84%
this epic chronology of
ancient knowledge and evidence,

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.250 align:middle line:84%
and putting it all
together in something

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.940 align:middle line:84%
that people can tangibly look
at and say, oh, that makes sense

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:90%
or it maybe doesn't make sense.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.308 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and one
of the intriguing parts

00:04:41.308 --> 00:04:44.000 align:middle line:84%
is that it's connecting
cultures around the world that

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.950 align:middle line:84%
were thought to be disparate and
not connected in any way prior,

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.620 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's a
big part of this.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.480 align:middle line:84%
So that brings up a whole
slew of other questions,

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.430 align:middle line:90%
like, how'd that happen?

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.190 align:middle line:10%
How, in supposedly
primitive times,

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.130 align:middle line:10%
did they develop the
same kind of symbolism,

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.272 align:middle line:10%
or parts of
language, or artwork,

00:05:04.272 --> 00:05:06.230 align:middle line:10%
when they're literally
halfway around the globe

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:10%
from each other?

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.253 align:middle line:84%
And that gets into some
very interesting territory.

00:05:10.253 --> 00:05:11.670 align:middle line:84%
So we'll go there
in a little bit.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:84%
But let's start with
the Sumerian story.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: OK.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.280 align:middle line:90%
Adapa?

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: So the Sumerian
story-- and then, of course,

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Billy has a lot of
knowledge in this area

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.210 align:middle line:84%
as well-- the Sumerian
story is interesting

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.940 align:middle line:84%
because there's
different chapters that

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.780 align:middle line:84%
seem to go back far, far earlier
than we've ever been taught

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.880 align:middle line:84%
in school or has been
acknowledged by mainstream

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.760 align:middle line:84%
archeologists to the point where
we're talking about something

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.130 align:middle line:84%
more than 12,000,
more than 50,000,

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.720 align:middle line:84%
maybe more than
100,000 years ago.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And even if certain tablets
can't survive that long,

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.670 align:middle line:84%
the story has been carried
down and then rescribed

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.920 align:middle line:84%
in those tablets over
and over and over again

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.940 align:middle line:84%
by subsequent cultures, such as
the Sumerians, the Akkadians,

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.790 align:middle line:84%
the Babylonians, the
Assyrians, the Chaldeans.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.560 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
about a region that

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.140 align:middle line:84%
has had more habitation by
civilizations, in my opinion,

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.700 align:middle line:90%
than anywhere else in the world.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And so because of that, and
because of their sophistication

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.050 align:middle line:84%
and influences, it enables
us to have a glimpse

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.050 align:middle line:84%
into looking at our
story in a way that's

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.570 align:middle line:84%
tangible and evidence-driven,
unlike really

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.613 align:middle line:84%
most of the places that
we have around the world.

00:06:17.613 --> 00:06:18.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is bringing up
a lot of different things

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.170 align:middle line:84%
you say as what's left in
tablets, papyrus, and so forth.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.553 align:middle line:90%
What's left with pyramids?

00:06:25.553 --> 00:06:28.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even Robert Schoch, when
he first saw the Great Pyramid,

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.450 align:middle line:84%
said he thought it was
closer to 100,000 years old.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.100 align:middle line:84%
You can't talk
about it publicly.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.930 align:middle line:90%
You lose tenure.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.100 align:middle line:90%
So we get that.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.440 align:middle line:84%
But I mean that was a fairly
shocking statement for him.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.943 align:middle line:84%
And we know others that
were contemporaneous

00:06:39.943 --> 00:06:42.110 align:middle line:84%
with his early work who
were saying the same things.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Now you're saying there's
yet even more evidence.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Exactly.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's
start with the notion--

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.940 align:middle line:84%
since we're talking
about the human species--

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:55.163 align:middle line:84%
that there was a notion of an
original perfected man, right?

00:06:55.163 --> 00:06:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a specific tablet
called "The Myth of Adapa,"

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.767 align:middle line:84%
that goes into that and actually
specifically calls that out.

00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And Billy and I have
talked about that

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.840 align:middle line:84%
in shows previous,
where the language in it

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.320 align:middle line:84%
actually says that this
was a perfected being that

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.775 align:middle line:84%
was considered a sage of the
first city of Eridu, which

00:07:13.775 --> 00:07:16.400 align:middle line:84%
was interesting because there's
another tablet called "The Uruk

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.500 align:middle line:84%
List of Kings and
Sages" that lists him

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.090 align:middle line:90%
as the first sage of that.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.120 align:middle line:84%
So you get this
cross-examination of tablets

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.620 align:middle line:90%
and information that correlate.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And what it says in
"The Myth of Adapa"

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.350 align:middle line:84%
is that Adapa was the
first perfect man created.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And it says that he was the
most perfect among the Anunnaki,

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.950 align:middle line:84%
as in we are them
and they are us,

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.740 align:middle line:84%
and that there was something
created in their image that

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.670 align:middle line:90%
was done so to be perfect.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think we should remember
that rather than this more

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.060 align:middle line:84%
primitive viewpoint that
we're given with aspects

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.560 align:middle line:90%
of Darwinism and other things.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree
with you on that.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Billy, what do you
have to say on this?

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.978 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, when you
look at "The Myth of Adapa,"

00:07:53.978 --> 00:07:57.560 align:middle line:84%
you realize that human beings
have such a high capacity

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.620 align:middle line:84%
for learning, spiritually
and technologically,

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and that there were people
here-- many more people, maybe

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.410 align:middle line:84%
even millions of people--
long before the Adapa,

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:10.773 align:middle line:84%
but Adapa was the first of
the more advanced created.

00:08:10.773 --> 00:08:12.440 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
best version of what

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:84%
they could do for Homo
sapien sapien, and that's

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:16.860 align:middle line:90%
where we came out of.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And so basically it's
not that we came out

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.900 align:middle line:84%
of only Adam and
Eve-- two people--

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.655 align:middle line:84%
because if you
inbreed like that,

00:08:22.655 --> 00:08:24.280 align:middle line:84%
we already know what's
going to happen.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:24.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.030 align:middle line:90%
You out-breed pretty fast.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:26.105 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.110 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.870 align:middle line:90%
Really fast.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.540 align:middle line:84%
So some people tend to
think that you still

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.850 align:middle line:84%
can get eight billion people
from two, but it's not--

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.429 align:middle line:84%
the thing is they duplicated
what they did with Adapa,

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:36.350 align:middle line:84%
but Adapa was one of
the very first sages

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:37.520 align:middle line:90%
and he had the wisdom.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And he was known
to potentially even

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:42.080 align:middle line:84%
be greater than the
Anunnaki themselves.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.308 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's fascinating.

00:08:43.308 --> 00:08:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, because
I have shared with you

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.230 align:middle line:84%
my own understanding
of the origin that

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.990 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the
original person, people,

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and it overlays with
what you're saying.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And I particularly like it when
there are points of connection

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.470 align:middle line:90%
between stories, so to speak.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And the one part of that
story that is an exact hit

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:05.780 align:middle line:84%
is that one type
of human, of being

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:10.260 align:middle line:84%
was chosen for this particular
expression as human being.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.960 align:middle line:90%
And that it existed already.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.840 align:middle line:84%
We're not an extension
of Neanderthals

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.460 align:middle line:90%
or any other species.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.200 align:middle line:84%
We are our own unique
perfected species to the degree

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.000 align:middle line:90%
that we're perfect.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.860 align:middle line:90%
And we were like us.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.462 align:middle line:90%
We look very similar.

00:09:23.462 --> 00:09:25.670 align:middle line:84%
However many hundreds of
thousands, millions of years

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.070 align:middle line:90%
ago, we were this already.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And this seems to overlay
with that to an extent,

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.865 align:middle line:84%
even if we don't know
timelines exactly.

00:09:32.865 --> 00:09:33.740 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, it
seems that that perfected

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:84%
being in that
location at that time

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:43.550 align:middle line:84%
gives us a way to look at it
and say, well, what was going on

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:44.550 align:middle line:90%
during that time period?

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.320 align:middle line:90%
But when was that time period?

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what the focus is.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
always the hard part.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was the
challenge here is,

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.760 align:middle line:84%
like, can we actually date
when these events occurred?

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out we
actually can if we

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.890 align:middle line:84%
take all the different
kings lists from Sumer--

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Sumerian King List, Uruk
List of Kings and Sages,

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:04.850 align:middle line:90%
the Berossus King List.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.100 align:middle line:84%
If we take them and
others, and we take them

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.933 align:middle line:84%
and look at the dating
that's used in that--

00:10:08.933 --> 00:10:09.975 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where do we go?

00:10:09.975 --> 00:10:11.480 align:middle line:84%
How far back do we
go if we do that?

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: We take a
story that is around--

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.850 align:middle line:84%
we'll give an estimation
because there's

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.370 align:middle line:84%
aspects on either end that
may go further or closer.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.450 align:middle line:84%
But I just like to give a
nice date of 200,000 years ago

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.820 align:middle line:84%
as a good date to start
with to really push.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the timeline
in the book is a 200,000-year

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.230 align:middle line:84%
timeline, because we've
identified that that seems

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.030 align:middle line:90%
to be--

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and of course, there may be
things that are earlier--

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.520 align:middle line:84%
but this seems to be a
date that we can reflect.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can peg in
some kind of physical reality

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:41.940 align:middle line:90%
by way of evidence.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:46.040 align:middle line:84%
And that was us as humans as
we exist now, as we are now,

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.290 align:middle line:84%
and we're a continued
expression of that.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Now you're saying going back
at least 200,000 years that you

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.160 align:middle line:90%
can verify.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: In the first
cities that were created,

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.695 align:middle line:84%
when kingship was lowered here,
not something where nomadic

00:10:57.695 --> 00:10:59.945 align:middle line:84%
hunter and gatherers found
a place that was suitable--

00:10:59.945 --> 00:11:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're right.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: --and they
decided to build.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.650 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a
place that was divinely

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:06.350 align:middle line:84%
chosen because of its
energy and other properties.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:07.720 align:middle line:90%
And then a city was built there.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about George Smith

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.850 align:middle line:84%
and how your work is building
upon the work of George Smith.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:17.420 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: So George Smith is
the first assyriologist expert.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And assyriologist
just is a general term

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.680 align:middle line:84%
that means anything in
the Mesopotamian area--

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.330 align:middle line:90%
Sumerian or anything.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.010 align:middle line:84%
They call themselves
assyriologists.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And he cracked a code
that has not been

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.080 align:middle line:90%
cracked in over 1,000 years.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.020 align:middle line:84%
He figured out how
to read and write

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.150 align:middle line:90%
a language that had died off--

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.060 align:middle line:84%
had died off in a way where
nobody knew how to read it,

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.350 align:middle line:90%
nobody knew how to speak it.

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:42.770 align:middle line:84%
It was something that was
almost lost to our entire story.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, unlike other
languages that share

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:49.010 align:middle line:84%
commonalities, Sumerian
and subsequent branches

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:53.270 align:middle line:84%
of Akkadian and Babylonian,
they are language isolates.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.580 align:middle line:84%
They don't share any
characteristics with anything.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:59.480 align:middle line:84%
If you were going to envision
an alien-like language,

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.590 align:middle line:90%
this is the one.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:03.650 align:middle line:84%
This language is
something that is just

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.120 align:middle line:90%
completely out of place.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.450 align:middle line:84%
It came from,
supposedly, the stars.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was handed down to us as
a way to preserve this message.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And they were brilliant because
the Sumerian language doesn't

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.800 align:middle line:90%
use any syllables or vowels.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.020 align:middle line:90%
It uses simply symbols.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.270 align:middle line:84%
So each word is
unique in its own way.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like you can take
letters and put them together.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.490 align:middle line:84%
You have to figure out
what each word means.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And so it makes it
extremely difficult,

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.410 align:middle line:84%
because if you were to try
to figure out a language,

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.650 align:middle line:84%
you could figure out
what each letter means

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.272 align:middle line:90%
and try to piece it together.

00:12:39.272 --> 00:12:40.980 align:middle line:84%
But that's what made
this so challenging.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.373 align:middle line:84%
And George Smith cracked
the code in the late 1800s,

00:12:44.373 --> 00:12:46.290 align:middle line:84%
and he figured out what
no one has figured out

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:47.370 align:middle line:90%
for over 1,000 years.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.560 align:middle line:84%
He figured out how to
tell our lost story.

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which I would
argue he's just back.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:54.960 align:middle line:90%
You know me.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.970 align:middle line:84%
I would argue
George Smith, that's

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.980 align:middle line:84%
because that was his
language and so he

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.480 align:middle line:84%
had the capability because
he had the innate knowledge

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and remembrance of
it, thank goodness.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I think is so
fascinating today is that there

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.850 align:middle line:84%
are people who come
with far memory,

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:12.210 align:middle line:84%
as Joan Grant termed it-- far
memory-- who are bringing back

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.850 align:middle line:84%
this knowledge that
otherwise would be lost.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.920 align:middle line:90%
So good on him.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.170 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
greatest contribution

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.350 align:middle line:84%
he made once this happened
that is feeding into your work.

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And then let's go from
this region into Egypt,

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.743 align:middle line:84%
because Egypt's history
is misunderstood.

00:13:28.743 --> 00:13:31.410 align:middle line:84%
It's believed that their culture
may have been at least a couple

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.330 align:middle line:84%
hundred thousand years
old, too, conquer it

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:34.990 align:middle line:90%
with Atlantis as well.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.220 align:middle line:90%
So let's get into it.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's get into what
George laid down

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:44.623 align:middle line:84%
that really was your touchstone
for this, and then into Egypt.

00:13:44.623 --> 00:13:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: OK, I'll start
and you can jump in.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:47.415 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, sure.

00:13:47.415 --> 00:13:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: So in 1849,
the greatest library

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:84%
that's ever been discovered
in history, far greater

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.100 align:middle line:84%
even than the famous library
of Alexandria in Egypt,

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.330 align:middle line:84%
was found in the Nineveh
Mosul area of Iraq.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.000 align:middle line:84%
It was a series of libraries
with the most significant being

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.220 align:middle line:84%
known as the Royal
Ashurbanipal Library.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And what that was was
a massive collection

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.180 align:middle line:84%
of different ancient cuneiform
tablets from the Sumerians,

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.390 align:middle line:84%
the Akkadians, the Babylonians,
all in the central library,

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.450 align:middle line:84%
because this great king and
priest, known as Ashurbanipal,

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.900 align:middle line:84%
had made it his mission and
his goal to go and search

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.360 align:middle line:84%
with his armies in
the entire region

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.990 align:middle line:84%
to find these tablets that
he described as already being

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.460 align:middle line:90%
ancient before him.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And he amassed this
incredible library.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And then later on, after he
died, the city was sacked

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.780 align:middle line:90%
and it was lost to time.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.590 align:middle line:84%
But because of the
fires, actually, they

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.230 align:middle line:84%
helped better preserve
these cuneiform tablets.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And then 1849, along comes
Austin Henry Laird who

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.540 align:middle line:90%
discovered this entire library.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.330 align:middle line:84%
But he didn't know how to
read or decipher the language.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.880 align:middle line:84%
That's where George Smith
comes in years later.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Taking these texts
from this library,

00:14:56.170 --> 00:15:00.420 align:middle line:84%
he was able to decipher it
in the first tablet that

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.320 align:middle line:84%
was ever figured out by him
was "The Epic of Gilgamesh."

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.533 align:middle line:84%
And he was described as
running around and being

00:15:07.533 --> 00:15:09.450 align:middle line:84%
very excited that he had
figured out something

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.780 align:middle line:84%
that had not been figured out
for well over 1,000 years.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is where our
understanding of that time

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:16.830 align:middle line:90%
period really begins.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:17.828 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:15:17.828 --> 00:15:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's go on
to Egypt in a second.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.347 align:middle line:84%
Where does any of this intersect
with the Vedas or does it?

00:15:23.347 --> 00:15:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It doesn't really
intersect particularly

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:26.510 align:middle line:90%
with the Vedas.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's its
own concurrent story

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:29.130 align:middle line:90%
of our timelines.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:30.980 align:middle line:90%
It's its own concurrent story.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.900 align:middle line:84%
The Vedas kind of have
their own concurrent story.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.733 align:middle line:84%
They're running
simultaneously side by side.

00:15:34.733 --> 00:15:35.533 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:35.533 --> 00:15:37.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I think both
of those civilizations

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.900 align:middle line:84%
go back hundreds of
thousands of years.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hundreds of thousands.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:40.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:40.730 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:43.355 align:middle line:10%
>>CARSON: But what's interesting
about George Smith is the fact

00:15:43.355 --> 00:15:46.273 align:middle line:10%
that if you look at Zecharia
Sitchin, who came along much

00:15:46.273 --> 00:15:48.440 align:middle line:10%
later, obviously in our
modern time, a lot of people

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.023 align:middle line:10%
thought that he was the one who
translated these tablets, when

00:15:51.023 --> 00:15:53.510 align:middle line:10%
in actuality he
was using existing

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:57.050 align:middle line:10%
translations by this man.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And he actually noted
that in his books.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:00.355 align:middle line:84%
People weren't really
paying attention.

00:16:00.355 --> 00:16:02.540 align:middle line:84%
A lot of his translations
were already done.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.770 align:middle line:84%
He didn't translate
really hardly anything.

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:06.050 align:middle line:90%
A lot of them already existed.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the greatest
reasons why this guy was

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:10.790 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest
researchers ever

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.620 align:middle line:84%
to be able to decipher
these tablets,

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.140 align:middle line:84%
and bring forth this information
and unlock this code,

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.940 align:middle line:84%
so that, in this
current time and era,

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.222 align:middle line:84%
we can actually have a chance
to understand and grasp

00:16:19.222 --> 00:16:20.930 align:middle line:84%
what really happened
in the ancient past,

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.570 align:middle line:84%
or at least as close to what
really happened as possible.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when was George
Smith doing this work?

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: 1800s.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 1800s.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: The late 1800s.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:90%
It was a large--

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because he was
contemporaneous with Laird,

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:32.450 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:33.545 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, after
they were discovered.

00:16:33.545 --> 00:16:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Duh.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.600 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.740 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, exactly.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
let's move the story--

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:42.140 align:middle line:84%
anything else you want to go
into regarding the Kings List

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and the name of the king whose
name I cannot pronounce--

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.450 align:middle line:90%
the one you just pronounced.

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well,
Adapa was the sage.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.252 align:middle line:90%
Alulim was the first king.

00:16:51.252 --> 00:16:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All right,
Alulim was the first king.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.910 align:middle line:84%
So when are we talking
about, historically?

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.290 align:middle line:90%
How far back are we going there?

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:58.873 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: We're
talking about a story

00:16:58.873 --> 00:17:02.240 align:middle line:84%
that if you were to take the
actual Sumerian King List

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.492 align:middle line:84%
and add it up and versus
something like the Berossus

00:17:05.492 --> 00:17:06.950 align:middle line:84%
King List, you're
getting something

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:10.829 align:middle line:84%
over 200,000 years ago,
potentially 240,000 years old.

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:12.829 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And where is
the Berossus King's List?

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:13.144 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Berossus.

00:17:13.144 --> 00:17:14.359 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where does
that emanate from?

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:15.159 align:middle line:90%
Where is--

00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Berossus was a high
priest of Babylon, of Marduk.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And he was chronologing
their history

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:25.310 align:middle line:84%
and taking the earlier
Sumerian and Akkadian.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And he was one of the ones that
was preserving and putting it

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.800 align:middle line:84%
into their civilization
and their culture.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.960 align:middle line:84%
So he was like their
scribe and their priest.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.860 align:middle line:10%
So it's another source from
another civilization that

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.573 align:middle line:10%
verified these other Sumerian--

00:17:38.573 --> 00:17:40.490 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And we're
getting similar timelines.

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:41.420 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Exactly.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: What also adds
to this timeline, which

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.810 align:middle line:84%
is very interesting if
you go to modern science,

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:48.080 align:middle line:84%
modern scientists,
biologists, they're

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.970 align:middle line:90%
looking at the human genome.

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And they find that
chromosome number two

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.827 align:middle line:84%
was spliced and fused and two
telomere caps were put on them.

00:17:56.827 --> 00:17:58.910 align:middle line:84%
But what they're saying
is that they're estimating

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.230 align:middle line:90%
it happened about when?

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.765 align:middle line:90%
200,000 years ago.

00:18:01.765 --> 00:18:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now,
who's saying this?

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Where is this research
being done right now?

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: That's being done
in a lot of universities--

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.480 align:middle line:90%
scientists, biologists.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they think the
number, or length, or whatever

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:12.710 align:middle line:84%
of our telomeres,
which is very, very

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.690 align:middle line:84%
key and important
to our longevity,

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.140 align:middle line:90%
were capped 200,000 years ago.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Correct.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.398 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's just talk
about telomeres for one second

00:18:19.398 --> 00:18:21.860 align:middle line:84%
so people understand what
the profundity of that.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, telomeres
are these little caps

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.192 align:middle line:90%
on the end of your chromosomes.

00:18:25.192 --> 00:18:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, in particular, the ones
on chromosome number two,

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.170 align:middle line:84%
every time your
DNA or your cells

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.732 align:middle line:84%
reproduce, these telomere
caps shrink little by little.

00:18:32.732 --> 00:18:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
break a little bit.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.565 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Just a
little tiny bit.

00:18:35.565 --> 00:18:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And over time, they
eventually run out.

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And when your
telomere caps run out

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.320 align:middle line:84%
of buffer material, which is
really like buffer material,

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.880 align:middle line:84%
then that's when the body
begins a death process.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's how you
age and actually die.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Scientists at Harvard
started researching this

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.250 align:middle line:84%
and found that they can stop
the degradation of telomeres

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:55.100 align:middle line:84%
in mice and were able to get
the mice to live three times

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.232 align:middle line:90%
their normal lifespan.

00:18:56.232 --> 00:18:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How'd they do that?

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Listen, we're
going to hang out over there

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:01.608 align:middle line:90%
because we all need it.

00:19:01.608 --> 00:19:03.320 align:middle line:90%
So they can do it now.

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.577 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why
our story, this book

00:19:05.577 --> 00:19:07.160 align:middle line:84%
is so important,
because we're talking

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.180 align:middle line:90%
about the epic of humanity.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.410 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
figuring out what

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:11.705 align:middle line:84%
happened so we can correct
what happened in the past

00:19:11.705 --> 00:19:13.580 align:middle line:84%
for the future, because
the past is prologue.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't, eventually
they may want to sell us time.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.850 align:middle line:84%
All right, well, the
people will be very piqued

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:22.440 align:middle line:90%
by the notion of longevity.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And the telomere story, I
became familiar with initially

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.580 align:middle line:90%
through Patrick Flanagan.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Patrick Flanagan and what he was
doing with his hydrogen water

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:34.680 align:middle line:84%
was really toward the end
of stopping the breakage

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.330 align:middle line:84%
and slowing the
breakage of telomeres.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And people can still
look all that up.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.130 align:middle line:84%
So he's been-- he was working
on it for decades himself.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And so now I'd be very
curious to find out

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.225 align:middle line:84%
what they're doing at Harvard
and other universities, what

00:19:46.225 --> 00:19:48.600 align:middle line:84%
they've discovered in terms
of lengthening our telomeres,

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.650 align:middle line:90%
thus extending our lives.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:54.080 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to who
would have capped us and why.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, it's I
believe it was these beings--

00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Marduk, and Enlil, and Enki,
and these other beings,

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.750 align:middle line:84%
they had the capability,
the technology

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:06.260 align:middle line:84%
to be able to genetically modify
Homo sapiens or hominids--

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.520 align:middle line:90%
hominids, basically.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.472 align:middle line:84%
And I think at one
point, they decided to--

00:20:10.472 --> 00:20:11.930 align:middle line:84%
they realized how
powerful we were.

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:14.263 align:middle line:84%
When you read "The Myth of
Adapa," and they were saying,

00:20:14.263 --> 00:20:16.640 align:middle line:84%
these people are
starting to outnumber us.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.220 align:middle line:84%
If they proceed along this path
with this level of greatness

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:84%
inside of them and live
for this many years,

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.220 align:middle line:84%
they're going to figure out
what do we need them for,

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.240 align:middle line:90%
what they need us.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.830 align:middle line:90%
So it's like AI for us.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.580 align:middle line:84%
If we keep going with
AI, eventually AI

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.580 align:middle line:84%
is going to be like, what
do we need humans for?

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.997 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
they said, you know

00:20:32.997 --> 00:20:35.310 align:middle line:84%
what, we've got to slow these
people down a little bit.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:36.393 align:middle line:90%
Let's cap their telomeres.

00:20:36.393 --> 00:20:39.968 align:middle line:84%
Let's reduce their years of
life, so that by the time

00:20:39.968 --> 00:20:41.510 align:middle line:84%
they figure it all
out, it's too late

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and another
generation comes back.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's this cycle
they have where

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.520 align:middle line:84%
they've got us
trapped in this cycle

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:90%
coming back and going forward.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.820 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden,
they can continue

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.880 align:middle line:10%
to execute their plans
and their agendas.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.427 align:middle line:84%
And we are just-- we're
not able to even see it.

00:20:56.427 --> 00:20:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
goes over the story

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:59.593 align:middle line:84%
that I've shared
with you before, too,

00:20:59.593 --> 00:21:01.670 align:middle line:84%
that the original human
being, the one you call

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:05.240 align:middle line:84%
the perfected being, was
actually imbued with a higher

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.600 align:middle line:84%
dimensional aspect that is
highly creative and intelligent

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.080 align:middle line:84%
and would be probably far
beyond what the Anunnaki were.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So it just maybe asleep
because there were problems.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.550 align:middle line:84%
So maybe not in full
recall of the capabilities.

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And so that, again,
overlays that story for me

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:25.160 align:middle line:84%
because it means
we had capabilities

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:30.570 align:middle line:84%
that were deliberately being
suppressed even to this day.

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:33.050 align:middle line:84%
So we became an amnesiac
species in addition

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:35.160 align:middle line:84%
to having shortened
telomeres and life spans.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:35.960 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And
disconnected DNA, which

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:38.180 align:middle line:84%
is what they call
the "junk DNA."

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I don't
think it's junk at all.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's not junk.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.042 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I think
it was disconnected

00:21:42.042 --> 00:21:45.810 align:middle line:84%
to reduce the power of
Adapa and his offspring.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:46.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:49.310 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we have
a couple of ways

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:51.350 align:middle line:84%
we can go, because we
need to get to Eridu,

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:54.320 align:middle line:84%
where Eridu is
poignant in this story.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Because from your research,
it's the oldest civilized city--

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.920 align:middle line:84%
city, as we know it--
of civilization--

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.323 align:middle line:90%
seed of civilization.

00:22:02.323 --> 00:22:03.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
Eridu and then

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.260 align:middle line:84%
we'll go back to the
Egyptian Kings List

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and with the understanding
that Egypt is far, far older.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.500 align:middle line:84%
It's just that most of it is
under the sands, literally,

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.490 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.380 align:middle line:10%
And I think one of
the things to add

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:18.350 align:middle line:10%
to that that goes along with
Eridu, because Billy made

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:19.820 align:middle line:10%
a great point
discussing telomeres

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.740 align:middle line:10%
and how the ages
seem to have changed.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.010 align:middle line:84%
It's directly related to Eridu
and Adapa and this whole story

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.543 align:middle line:84%
because what we find is
that in those kings lists,

00:22:27.543 --> 00:22:29.460 align:middle line:84%
in those lists that we
find around the world--

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.120 align:middle line:84%
and it's not just Sumerian
and Akkadian and Babylonian.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.770 align:middle line:84%
But we have the
Egyptian Turin King

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:36.260 align:middle line:84%
List, the Egyptian-- it's known
as the Egyptian King List.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And what we find
is the same thing

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:41.420 align:middle line:84%
is shown there where we have
these long, long longevities

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:42.830 align:middle line:90%
of these beings early on.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:44.420 align:middle line:90%
And then it just keeps getting--

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Shorter and shorter.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: --shorter
and shorter.

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, all of a sudden
we have this catastrophe that

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.800 align:middle line:84%
occurs, called the Great
Flood, which we believe

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.720 align:middle line:84%
was either the events
of the Younger Dryas

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.420 align:middle line:84%
12,000 years ago or maybe
even an earlier event.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:00.140 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was it's
discussed in a tablet called

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.640 align:middle line:90%
"The death of Bilgames."

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And Bilgames was another
name for Gilgamesh.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.770 align:middle line:84%
It discusses in there
how because Gilgamesh

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:09.590 align:middle line:84%
was a king that lived
after this great event,

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:11.450 align:middle line:84%
that he was one of
the last mortals

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:14.310 align:middle line:84%
and one of the last humans
that had a long longevity.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And then after, all
of a sudden, it's

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:18.890 align:middle line:84%
discussed how humans
would only live

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:20.420 align:middle line:90%
for a short amount of time.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And I agree that
that was probably

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.950 align:middle line:84%
related to the idea of how
sophisticated and advanced

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:27.260 align:middle line:84%
we could be if we
could live that long

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:31.160 align:middle line:84%
or the potential of being there
for something that could exceed

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.860 align:middle line:84%
any of our expertise
understanding

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.130 align:middle line:84%
today of what's capable
of consciousness

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:38.270 align:middle line:90%
in the human beings.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I think
we're headed back there now.

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:39.960 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: We are.

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --we're in a
really ugly little place

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.520 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you have to
step through some poo

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:45.900 align:middle line:90%
to get to the other side.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think we are going
back into extended lifespans

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.420 align:middle line:84%
and an expansion
of consciousness.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.420 align:middle line:90%
That's the good news.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.210 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, look
where we've been.

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:56.100 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm just throwing
this in the works.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.770 align:middle line:90%
So the whole notion of Atlantis.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, Atlantis supposedly
existed until about--

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.690 align:middle line:84%
till the last great
deluge, right?

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:03.530 align:middle line:90%
Younger Dryas.

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:06.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's just under
12,000 years ago.

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.720 align:middle line:90%
And those beings were said to--

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.720 align:middle line:84%
some of the beings, not all--
layers and layers of beings--

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.680 align:middle line:84%
lived hundreds and hundreds of
years on Atlantis at that time.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.620 align:middle line:84%
How does that fit in or does
it with this story since we

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.820 align:middle line:90%
don't have the evidence?

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.785 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well, I mean you
got to look at it like this--

00:24:23.785 --> 00:24:25.410 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the
Sumerian Kings List,

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:27.480 align:middle line:84%
in my personal
opinion, I believe

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:31.140 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of the people that
were the builders of Atlantis

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.710 align:middle line:84%
were the Sumerian
Kings List people--

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: --and their offspring.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:35.745 align:middle line:90%
And their lifespans--

00:24:35.745 --> 00:24:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:37.155 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: --were extensive.

00:24:37.155 --> 00:24:38.070 align:middle line:90%
28,000 years.

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.950 align:middle line:90%
14,000.

00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:40.835 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the years are
just mind-boggling

00:24:40.835 --> 00:24:42.960 align:middle line:84%
how somebody can just rule
for that amount of time,

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.820 align:middle line:84%
yet alone how long did
they actually live.

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.472 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: And I believe that
those were the beings that

00:24:47.472 --> 00:24:49.950 align:middle line:84%
were responsible for
building a global Atlantean

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:51.120 align:middle line:90%
civilization on Earth.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And that the ring
city was just one

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:54.690 align:middle line:84%
capital of many
capitals on Earth

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:56.040 align:middle line:90%
that existed at that time.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:57.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:58.140 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: So there's your
connection, basically.

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:00.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
the connection.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:01.377 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm looking for.

00:25:01.377 --> 00:25:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Because from Atlantis,
they were said

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.790 align:middle line:84%
to have gone out
in flying ships.

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:06.660 align:middle line:90%
Ships of all kinds.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:08.340 align:middle line:90%
Ships without oars and so forth.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.610 align:middle line:90%
All around the world.

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And these legends are
everywhere all over the globe.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:13.907 align:middle line:84%
So ships without oars
kind of gives you

00:25:13.907 --> 00:25:15.990 align:middle line:84%
a hint of what we might
be looking at here, right?

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.865 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Absolutely.

00:25:16.865 --> 00:25:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] So these
people and this knowledge,

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.080 align:middle line:90%
the technologies--

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.930 align:middle line:84%
some, not others-- were
spread around the planet.

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:30.810 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the length
of the Egyptians Kings Lists.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And then let's go to
this connectedness

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.400 align:middle line:84%
and symbology that
you're finding--

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.500 align:middle line:84%
symbolism you're finding
around the world that's

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.950 align:middle line:90%
connecting these stories.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Egyptian
Kings List is really

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:45.000 align:middle line:84%
amazing, because it's so similar
to the Sumerian Kings List,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000 align:middle line:84%
which I just went and
saw with my own eyes,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.260 align:middle line:84%
finally, at the Ashmolean
Museum in Oxford, England.

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.760 align:middle line:84%
I finally got a chance to walk
up to it and actually see it.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:54.480 align:middle line:90%
I was so close.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.070 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to touch
it, but the glass--

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:58.673 align:middle line:84%
but you go to Egypt
and you see this list

00:25:58.673 --> 00:26:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, all
of a sudden you

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:02.292 align:middle line:84%
see these people living
for thousands of years.

00:26:02.292 --> 00:26:03.750 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
the life spans just

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:05.280 align:middle line:84%
getting shorter and
shorter and shorter.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.863 align:middle line:84%
But when you analyze
a lot of the work

00:26:06.863 --> 00:26:08.910 align:middle line:84%
from the Atra-Hasis
and the Enuma Elish

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:12.240 align:middle line:84%
and you see that after the Great
Deluge, which is my opinion

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:16.890 align:middle line:84%
is the Younger Dryas, kingship
is handed down to the humans.

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, what they've done
is I believe initially

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:23.430 align:middle line:84%
it was a half human and a
half Anunnaki, a demigod.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And over time, those
life spans just

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.960 align:middle line:84%
got shorter and
shorter and shorter.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that same
progression all the way up

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.230 align:middle line:84%
until you get to the Greek
Roman era on that list

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.130 align:middle line:84%
where people were
just living 40 years.

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:36.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:39.210 align:middle line:90%
We're on the rebound from that--

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:41.195 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --of those
days, fortunately.

00:26:41.195 --> 00:26:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah.

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.278 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's get
back to the Younger Dryas.

00:26:44.278 --> 00:26:45.570 align:middle line:90%
Let's get back to some of this.

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:49.650 align:middle line:84%
There was always-- there's been
an understanding or a belief,

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:51.780 align:middle line:84%
depending on the community
and background people

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.580 align:middle line:84%
are from, that there
are beings that

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:57.090 align:middle line:84%
oversee things,
such as catastrophe,

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:01.440 align:middle line:84%
global extinctions, and so
forth-- mass extinction events.

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Does this show up
anywhere in your work

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:08.050 align:middle line:84%
that these mass extinctions
were by some kind of design

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:11.370 align:middle line:84%
or agreement from some
council of beings or beings

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:12.340 align:middle line:90%
from elsewhere?

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.200 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that's echoed
whether or not it's looking

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.360 align:middle line:84%
at the Atra-Hasis
or looking at--

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.270 align:middle line:84%
I've identified at least
five other tablets from Sumer

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:24.690 align:middle line:84%
down into Babylon where
there seems to be this--

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.660 align:middle line:84%
I guess you could call
it massive disagreement

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:29.700 align:middle line:90%
among these Anunna gods.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And the Anunna was the
original term in Sumer.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And the Anunnaki was actually
a later Akkadian Babylonian

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.180 align:middle line:90%
term that came.

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.310 align:middle line:84%
But in these
tablets, it discusses

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:41.010 align:middle line:84%
how there was almost
this infighting

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:43.860 align:middle line:84%
between these beings, how some
of them that had more power

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.310 align:middle line:84%
decided that they call that
humans were being too loud

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:50.460 align:middle line:84%
and reproducing too much and
disrupting the natural balance.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And they also had
connotations to connecting

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:59.400 align:middle line:84%
to the idea of living
these extensive long lives

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.800 align:middle line:84%
and also inbreeding
creating these Nephilim

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.590 align:middle line:84%
giants with the cross
of the demigod, cross

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:07.620 align:middle line:84%
between the Anunna
beings and human beings.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.870 align:middle line:84%
So there seemed to be all
these things that happened

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:11.610 align:middle line:90%
that wasn't part of a plan.

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:13.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And giants are
found all over the planet.

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:15.728 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: They were
found all over the planet.

00:28:15.728 --> 00:28:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And even Magellan found them
on their travels of Patagonia

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:21.060 align:middle line:84%
and South America,
and many, many others

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:22.818 align:middle line:84%
it's been shown
throughout history.

00:28:22.818 --> 00:28:24.360 align:middle line:84%
But what they discuss
in the tablets,

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.640 align:middle line:84%
specifically, is
how they decided

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:30.070 align:middle line:84%
to wipe out humanity and
basically start over again.

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was this agreement
made between them

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:34.830 align:middle line:84%
where they couldn't
tell any of the humans.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was,
Enki, this creator God

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:40.620 align:middle line:84%
that seems to be
on our side who was

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:43.290 align:middle line:84%
the one responsible for
originally creating us,

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:46.530 align:middle line:84%
secretly warned a
bloodline king who

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:49.620 align:middle line:84%
wrote the Atra-Hasis named
Ubara-tutu or Ziusudra,

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:51.900 align:middle line:84%
depending on the actual
text you're reading,

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.970 align:middle line:84%
warning him through
a very creative way.

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:56.130 align:middle line:84%
He warned him through
a set of reeds

00:28:56.130 --> 00:29:00.210 align:middle line:84%
where he technically didn't
break his vow by appearing,

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:05.220 align:middle line:84%
but he spoke through an
aspiration of himself

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.020 align:middle line:84%
to speak to him
and tell him, look,

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.300 align:middle line:90%
this catastrophe is coming.

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Through reeds?

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah, through reeds.

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:12.390 align:middle line:84%
You're part of an
ancient bloodline

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:13.770 align:middle line:90%
that needs to be preserved.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:14.965 align:middle line:90%
Protect your family.

00:29:14.965 --> 00:29:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Protect everything
you have around you.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:17.940 align:middle line:90%
This catastrophe is coming.

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.000 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.277 align:middle line:84%
And thankfully,
that bloodline is

00:29:21.277 --> 00:29:23.610 align:middle line:84%
one of the bloodlines that
literally carried on humanity

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:25.830 align:middle line:84%
after these events,
which we believe

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:28.450 align:middle line:84%
are the Younger Dryas
catastrophes of around 12,000

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:29.250 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:32.400 align:middle line:84%
When we compare ice core
samples and geologic evidence

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.430 align:middle line:84%
to see that there was this time
period of Earth when the Ice

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Age dramatically ended,
very, very quickly.

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And these set of events
were so catastrophic

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.060 align:middle line:84%
that they seem to have wiped
out this global civilization

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:49.140 align:middle line:84%
that we find evidence all
around the world from.

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so I have a
question for both of you

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.310 align:middle line:84%
and it maybe
extends beyond this.

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:59.580 align:middle line:84%
But the notion that these beings
made decisions on our behalf--

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:00.665 align:middle line:90%
thank you--

00:30:00.665 --> 00:30:02.790 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:06.240 align:middle line:84%
--taking us into
consideration, of course.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.620 align:middle line:84%
What about the notion of
the cosmos and the planets

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:10.420 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.180 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the
planets, as I think

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:16.080 align:middle line:84%
is also indicated, as their own
entity, very powerful entities

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and beings, our solar system,
each one its own being,

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:22.630 align:middle line:84%
its own influence on
each other and on us,

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:24.210 align:middle line:90%
including Gaia herself.

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that the
cosmos, the solar system,

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:32.040 align:middle line:84%
these council of
planets and beings

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.750 align:middle line:90%
also made these decisions?

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Gaia herself made
these decisions?

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.610 align:middle line:90%
Does that show up anywhere?

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Or is it always down to
these guys, interlopers?

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: It's an interesting
theory because if you look

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:47.250 align:middle line:84%
at the Enuma Elish, and
based on how you read it,

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:49.440 align:middle line:84%
you could interpret it
as the conscious planets,

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.430 align:middle line:90%
conscious moons--

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: --having
a battle with one

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.720 align:middle line:84%
another versus it
actually being some type

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.640 align:middle line:90%
of a Galactic or space war.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's really up to the
interpretation of the person,

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:01.150 align:middle line:90%
how you can interpret it.

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:03.037 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that
planets are conscious,

00:31:03.037 --> 00:31:03.870 align:middle line:90%
moons are conscious.

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:04.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: I believe that
Earth is extremely conscious,

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.470 align:middle line:84%
and that these planets are
being very gracious to us.

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:12.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And any time if
Mother Earth decides

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.950 align:middle line:84%
to just shake the back a little
bit, we'll all fall right off.

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:18.945 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
another possibility--

00:31:18.945 --> 00:31:20.070 align:middle line:90%
there could be two players.

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:24.180 align:middle line:84%
One could be these beings who
tinkered and created, directed

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:26.460 align:middle line:84%
catastrophes, as
well as Mother Earth

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:31.115 align:middle line:84%
and, like you say, the
planetary council holding us

00:31:31.115 --> 00:31:33.240 align:middle line:84%
back or trying to give us
some more time to grow up

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.560 align:middle line:90%
and mature as well.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.977 align:middle line:84%
It could be a
combination of both.

00:31:35.977 --> 00:31:37.477 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm wondering,

00:31:37.477 --> 00:31:39.600 align:middle line:84%
because in all these
talks, it never comes up

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.150 align:middle line:84%
that maybe Earth
decided herself,

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:44.445 align:middle line:90%
you know what, I need a break.

00:31:44.445 --> 00:31:45.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:46.300 align:middle line:90%
I need a break.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And so just like you say,
shake us off like fleas,

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.910 align:middle line:90%
and we'll get started again.

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:52.380 align:middle line:84%
You guys have many
lifetimes, you

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.750 align:middle line:84%
can come back if you wish
or go somewhere else.

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:57.160 align:middle line:84%
We'll see if we can do
better this next time.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.700 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to bring
that in, because certainly

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.920 align:middle line:84%
in hermetic culture,
it's understood

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.740 align:middle line:84%
that almost everything
is always referring back

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:07.410 align:middle line:84%
to the cosmos and these planets,
these various beings that have

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:09.090 align:middle line:90%
names that we see historically.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:13.470 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the war
between Anu with Tiamat.

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:15.565 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Yeah,
that's expanding just

00:32:15.565 --> 00:32:17.440 align:middle line:84%
on what Billy just talked
about a minute ago.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.460 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: There's this set of
tablets called the Enuma Elish.

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And they're a set
of tablets that

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.120 align:middle line:84%
are earlier Sumerian
stories that

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.040 align:middle line:90%
then became Babylonian stories.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And they have everything
from the origin story

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:32.260 align:middle line:84%
to something earlier
that is very mysterious,

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.135 align:middle line:90%
like Billy mentioned.

00:32:33.135 --> 00:32:35.020 align:middle line:90%
It seemed to be this concept--

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and there are many opinions
on what it's trying to say.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a very
ambiguous set of text

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:43.860 align:middle line:84%
that discusses in a way
where you either see it

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:48.330 align:middle line:84%
as some kind of a celestial
battle between these beings

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:50.880 align:middle line:84%
in here or you see
it as just some kind

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.200 align:middle line:90%
of a natural phenomenon.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.110 align:middle line:84%
But here's where it gets
interesting because the work

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:57.870 align:middle line:84%
of George Smith in the
Chaldean account of Genesis,

00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:00.480 align:middle line:84%
he discusses how it seems
to be both happening

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.380 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.338 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Explain that.

00:33:02.338 --> 00:33:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: It's this concept of
something intelligent that is

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:10.140 align:middle line:84%
super powerful that can create
around itself and have this

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:15.780 align:middle line:84%
omnipotence versus these planets
and these consciousness around

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:20.160 align:middle line:84%
these planets that seem
to make their own--

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.280 align:middle line:84%
I guess not decisions,
but they kind of

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.280 align:middle line:90%
do what they want to do.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.800 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the Earth
goes through these periods

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.320 align:middle line:90%
of being very violent, right?

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And Mother Earth decides
that she's unbalanced,

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.550 align:middle line:90%
and so she becomes violent.

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:35.310 align:middle line:84%
In my interpretation
of the text,

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:38.100 align:middle line:84%
this earlier account
of it was called Tiamat

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.830 align:middle line:84%
and it was this idea that
the Anunna were almost

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:44.250 align:middle line:84%
battling against this
unbalanced and angry--

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:46.350 align:middle line:84%
they call it a chaotic
nature of Earth.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
George Smith believed

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.962 align:middle line:84%
was that the idea
of this primordial--

00:33:51.962 --> 00:33:53.670 align:middle line:84%
actually Graham Hancock
even talked about

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:57.300 align:middle line:84%
it as well-- this primordial
chaotic aspect of Earth

00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:02.680 align:middle line:84%
that had to be almost subdued,
that had to be altered.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And so whether or not that's
some kind of a geoengineering

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:08.489 align:middle line:84%
or some kind of a terraforming
event that they were doing,

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:10.949 align:middle line:84%
there seemed to be a
battle between Earth

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:14.250 align:middle line:84%
and these beings on how
they wanted to control

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:16.800 align:middle line:90%
to have it be their way.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.739 align:middle line:84%
And how this balance would
harmonize on the Earth

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:22.650 align:middle line:84%
so that maybe conscious beings
could actually exist there,

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:24.120 align:middle line:84%
because the way
they describe it is

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:27.360 align:middle line:84%
it was so volatile that
nothing could exist.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:30.239 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
geologically in history,

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:32.730 align:middle line:84%
through tectonic changes
and massive volcanism,

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:35.159 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth can
be extremely violent.

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So this would bring to mind then
the notion of the yugas, cycles

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:41.370 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And it would bring the
notion that on this planet,

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:47.826 align:middle line:84%
we've always had waves of
consciousness high and low.

00:34:47.826 --> 00:34:49.409 align:middle line:84%
And that means the
Earth herself would

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:51.510 align:middle line:84%
be emanating these
conscious waves

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:54.970 align:middle line:84%
of basic destruction
and rebirth, destruction

00:34:54.970 --> 00:34:55.770 align:middle line:90%
and rebirth.

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Right.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:56.280 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And same
thing that happens

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:58.713 align:middle line:90%
to every single one of us.

00:34:58.713 --> 00:35:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Same thing that happens
to every cell in our body.

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:06.490 align:middle line:84%
So it makes perfect sense
to me that they can--

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:07.950 align:middle line:84%
you can use any
kind of archetype

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:09.460 align:middle line:84%
you want for this
kind of battle.

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:12.010 align:middle line:84%
But maybe that is
the nature of Earth.

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: It's quite possible.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that the nature
of Earth as we go through

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:18.840 align:middle line:84%
as beings who are choosing
to incarnate on Earth,

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:22.260 align:middle line:84%
you go through lowered phases
of consciousness with extreme

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.450 align:middle line:90%
challenge and you have to do--

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:27.630 align:middle line:84%
the great opportunity here--
learn to deal with challenge.

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And you start rising
up where there's

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:33.180 align:middle line:84%
less challenge, more opening
for higher thinking, greater

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:36.310 align:middle line:84%
solutions, cleaner
living, all of that.

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And we go through these higher
spiritual elevated periods

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:40.650 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:42.390 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's just part of Earth.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Maybe she's always going
to have these cycles.

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And anyone who incarnates her
is doing it for that very reason

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:50.700 align:middle line:84%
to ride through this and learn
these dance lessons which they

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.530 align:middle line:84%
say is greater than
the angels themselves

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:55.560 align:middle line:84%
if you can get through
these lessons on Earth.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Right.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.650 align:middle line:84%
If you look also into
even modern astronomy

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:02.460 align:middle line:84%
and astrophysics, you
discover that our solar system

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.290 align:middle line:90%
was dropped into place here.

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:07.560 align:middle line:84%
We actually come from the
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:10.020 align:middle line:84%
This has now been rewritten
in all universities

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.790 align:middle line:90%
in astrophysics books.

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:15.180 align:middle line:84%
So our solar system was
dropped into place here.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.190 align:middle line:84%
The Milky Way
galaxy is currently

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:21.223 align:middle line:84%
merging still right now with
the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.

00:36:21.223 --> 00:36:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:24.598 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Not the constellation,
but the Sagittarius dwarf.

00:36:24.598 --> 00:36:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And the pinpoint in where the
Sagittarius dwarf wraps around

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:30.750 align:middle line:84%
and intersects and is being
swallowed up by the Milky Way

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:32.520 align:middle line:84%
is right here in
our solar system.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.403 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, what's
the implication of that?

00:36:34.403 --> 00:36:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Well,
the implication is

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:38.490 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the Enuma Elish,
with all the turmoil and all

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:40.990 align:middle line:84%
the planets trying to find their
orbits and all the crashing

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and colliding of
planets and moons

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.030 align:middle line:84%
together, you have
the situation where

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:49.080 align:middle line:84%
you have two galaxies right
now, still today, merging.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
these planets and moons

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:52.890 align:middle line:84%
trying to find
new orbits, trying

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:55.980 align:middle line:84%
to collect new routes
around different suns.

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we are right now.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so we have these
constant solar influences

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:01.860 align:middle line:90%
of destruction.

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
it begins to feel

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:08.320 align:middle line:84%
like a kind of repetitive boring
game after a while, honestly.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.230 align:middle line:90%
But let's go further than that.

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:14.700 align:middle line:84%
So the thing about it is when
you have these mass extinction

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:18.150 align:middle line:84%
events, these various
destructions, it basically

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:20.700 align:middle line:84%
blasts us back
into amnesia again.

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.320 align:middle line:90%
And we never seem to get ahead.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Any kind of comments that
you see in anything you've

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.960 align:middle line:84%
read along the way of
why the need for humans

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.910 align:middle line:90%
to go through this constantly.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:32.070 align:middle line:84%
Fall asleep, wake up,
fall asleep, wake up,

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:33.180 align:middle line:90%
just like we do every day.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.597 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Well, like Billy
just brought up a great point.

00:37:35.597 --> 00:37:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Is this creation
of solar system,

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.740 align:middle line:84%
is this something that
happens where it's

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.780 align:middle line:90%
created for a certain purpose?

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:45.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we should
underestimate the significance

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:46.440 align:middle line:90%
of these Anunna.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.090 align:middle line:84%
George Smith had
this great quote

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:51.000 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the Chaldean
account of Genesis,

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and I consider him the greatest
scholar in this of all time.

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:55.170 align:middle line:84%
He said this very
interesting line

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:58.440 align:middle line:84%
where he discusses how it seems
that the Anunna came backwards

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.073 align:middle line:90%
and forwards into time.

00:38:00.073 --> 00:38:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:02.948 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Where there
was some kind of a plan,

00:38:02.948 --> 00:38:05.020 align:middle line:84%
there was something that
they wanted to happen.

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:08.190 align:middle line:84%
But to do it, they had to
go back and have something

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:10.177 align:middle line:90%
occur here to get to here.

00:38:10.177 --> 00:38:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, what that implies
is that there's

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.440 align:middle line:84%
some kind of
ordaining or deciding

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:15.690 align:middle line:90%
of how things are going to be.

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:16.110 align:middle line:90%
And I think--

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:17.767 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On behalf
of us, thank you.

00:38:17.767 --> 00:38:18.567 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: Yeah.

00:38:18.567 --> 00:38:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to be
this commonality where

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.090 align:middle line:84%
it was this decision
made where Earth

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:27.330 align:middle line:84%
and this ascension of
consciousness and things

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:29.230 align:middle line:84%
going on here were
supposed to happen.

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:30.728 align:middle line:84%
But here's the
interesting thing,

00:38:30.728 --> 00:38:33.270 align:middle line:84%
if you look at what's known as
the procession of the Equinox,

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:35.940 align:middle line:84%
there is a wobble of the
Earth that faces different

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:39.270 align:middle line:84%
constellations during
this 26,000-year cycle,

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:40.560 align:middle line:90%
known as the Great Year.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.530 align:middle line:84%
What we find is that there
are these cycles built

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:46.690 align:middle line:84%
into that cycle where these
catastrophes seem to happen.

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:48.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
that's by accident.

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where you have many
cycles within the big cycle.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:50.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Yes.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.968 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: If you were to
create an environment where

00:38:52.968 --> 00:38:56.250 align:middle line:84%
you could have these beings
where it's almost like a game.

00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you were these
omnipotent beings

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.020 align:middle line:84%
and everything to
you is like games.

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of how far
can a conscious being

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.520 align:middle line:90%
get in a certain amount of time?

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't, it
has to start over again.

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:10.620 align:middle line:84%
How far can it get
in that next cycle?

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:13.290 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be exactly
what's playing out here

00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:17.100 align:middle line:84%
is that we have 12,000,
maybe sometimes 24,000 years,

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:20.070 align:middle line:84%
depending on what we
look at geologically.

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:21.900 align:middle line:84%
But there are these
cyclical events

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.270 align:middle line:84%
that seem to be
reoccurring on this basis

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:26.940 align:middle line:84%
where we only get a certain
amount of time to see

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.020 align:middle line:90%
how far can you get.

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Exactly.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: And then you
get to start over again.

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:31.350 align:middle line:90%
It seems to be like a game.

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, not
a pleasant one.

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:34.618 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: It's not
a pleasant one to us.

00:39:34.618 --> 00:39:36.288 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is,
what if we can--

00:39:36.288 --> 00:39:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and I want Billy to
talk about this--

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And hack this now.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.230 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: --because
Billy is the one who

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:41.813 align:middle line:84%
writes about this
at the end the book,

00:39:41.813 --> 00:39:44.700 align:middle line:84%
is, what if we can
technologically and spiritually

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.440 align:middle line:84%
and through
knowledge, everything

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:49.430 align:middle line:84%
we've learned from the past,
what if we can beat this game

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:50.870 align:middle line:90%
and not have to start over?

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:52.160 align:middle line:90%
Where could we get to?

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
the $64,000 question.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of people
watching this, and myself,

00:39:57.350 --> 00:39:58.700 align:middle line:90%
believe is possible.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: So like Matt was
saying, if you look at the way

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:05.270 align:middle line:84%
that we're in this
particular type

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:07.710 align:middle line:84%
of fractaholographic
matrix is what I call it.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think that what
he's saying is accurate.

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:12.740 align:middle line:84%
There's this game
board that's laid out

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:15.050 align:middle line:84%
for these omnipotent
beings and they're

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:19.070 align:middle line:84%
seeing how far a species
can go, a sentient species

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:21.900 align:middle line:84%
can go within a certain period
of time in these cycles.

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:25.070 align:middle line:84%
But the ultimate
goal, as in any game--

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:26.840 align:middle line:84%
because when we
create video games,

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.310 align:middle line:84%
it's just a fractal of what
we're already living in.

00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:33.073 align:middle line:84%
And so the goal in a video game
is to get to the top level.

00:40:33.073 --> 00:40:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And for us to get
to the top level

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:35.660 align:middle line:90%
is to get to the Golden Age.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:37.250 align:middle line:84%
But not only to get
to the Golden Age,

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:38.690 align:middle line:90%
but also sustain it.

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Crack the code and not let
the loop start all over again.

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you can stop
the loop from going

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and you can stay within that
Golden Age and sustain it,

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:50.270 align:middle line:84%
that's the ultimate
civilization that I

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:52.520 align:middle line:84%
believe will be the
dominant civilization that

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.100 align:middle line:84%
will have an effect on
the entire universe.

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And nowhere have I seen written
anywhere in any text or any

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.440 align:middle line:84%
scripture, cylinder,
scroll, papyrus, anywhere,

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:02.610 align:middle line:90%
that says we can't do that.

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think ultimately
that is the true goal

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:07.910 align:middle line:84%
and the true destiny of
this particular civilization

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:09.823 align:middle line:90%
that we're in right now.

00:41:09.823 --> 00:41:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree
with you, Billy.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.657 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you have
something that's

00:41:12.657 --> 00:41:15.230 align:middle line:84%
working against
something else so hard,

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:16.310 align:middle line:90%
there's a reason for it.

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:18.180 align:middle line:84%
That means it's a
threat on some level.

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:18.980 align:middle line:90%
It shouldn't be.

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:20.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, like you say,
maybe it's just a game.

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:23.810 align:middle line:84%
But that's a pretty
dire and serious game

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:28.680 align:middle line:84%
you're playing with constant
retraumatization of a species.

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.110 align:middle line:90%
So why us?

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:31.703 align:middle line:90%
Why is Earth--

00:41:31.703 --> 00:41:33.620 align:middle line:84%
I've got my own thoughts
on it, but let's talk

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:34.703 align:middle line:90%
about your thoughts on it.

00:41:34.703 --> 00:41:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Why is Earth so interesting
to all these other species?

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CARSON: Earth is a great
proving ground, I think,

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.428 align:middle line:90%
for sentient consciousness.

00:41:42.428 --> 00:41:43.970 align:middle line:84%
There's so much that
you can do here.

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:45.470 align:middle line:84%
There's so much that
you can aspire to.

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:47.990 align:middle line:84%
So many levels of ascension here
through knowledge, and wisdom,

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.890 align:middle line:90%
and understanding.

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:50.300 align:middle line:90%
So much turmoil.

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:52.580 align:middle line:84%
This universe that we're
in, this particular universe

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:55.050 align:middle line:84%
is actually based
on consumption.

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:57.050 align:middle line:84%
We're living in a universe
based on consumption.

00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:58.675 align:middle line:84%
Everything must
consume something else.

00:41:58.675 --> 00:42:00.560 align:middle line:84%
The deer doesn't want
to be eaten by a bear.

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.118 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the deer
fights to get away,

00:42:02.118 --> 00:42:03.410 align:middle line:90%
but it can't and it gets eaten.

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:06.710 align:middle line:84%
So everything is going through
this same exact situation.

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:10.520 align:middle line:84%
But it seems as if for the
human species, Homo sapiens,

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:13.773 align:middle line:84%
our destiny is to be able to
acquire a lot of knowledge,

00:42:13.773 --> 00:42:14.690 align:middle line:90%
data, and information.

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:17.360 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we are
transmitting in real time

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.575 align:middle line:84%
our life experiences
back to source.

00:42:20.575 --> 00:42:21.950 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
the ultimate thing

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:25.190 align:middle line:84%
is that consciousness,
which is there's only one,

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:28.130 align:middle line:84%
is expressing itself
as googles of entities

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:30.890 align:middle line:84%
throughout the entire universe
and it's collecting data

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:34.130 align:middle line:84%
from all of us so it can
understand what it means

00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:37.940 align:middle line:84%
to be in this particular cycle
and this sector of a galaxy

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:40.680 align:middle line:84%
or this other sector
of another galaxy.

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And what does it take
for it to ascend itself

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:44.940 align:middle line:90%
to a higher level?

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:48.230 align:middle line:10%
Maybe the mass consciousness
that we're all a part of

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:51.200 align:middle line:10%
is trying itself to
get to another level

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:54.230 align:middle line:10%
that we can't even
perceive because we're just

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:55.080 align:middle line:10%
a fractal of it.

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.930 align:middle line:10%
And if we're trying
to ascend consciously,

00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:58.790 align:middle line:10%
it's trying to
continue to ascend.

00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:00.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's collecting
and we're like

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.680 align:middle line:84%
the little sensory
perceptions of it.

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:07.700 align:middle line:10%
We have our eyes here, hands,
taste buds and everything else

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:09.620 align:middle line:10%
going out and collecting
data so our brain can

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:10.550 align:middle line:10%
know what's going on.

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:12.090 align:middle line:90%
And we're like that for it.

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we're all
transmitting back to it.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's trying to
figure out, OK, now

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.800 align:middle line:84%
how do I get to the next level
through all this learning?

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's knowledge
that can be embodied anywhere

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:25.040 align:middle line:90%
in the universe and utilized.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.287 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking at--
what you're saying--

00:43:27.287 --> 00:43:28.370 align:middle line:90%
this is about consumption.

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:31.160 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at moving
beyond predatory behaviors

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:35.600 align:middle line:84%
of all kinds in all species on
this planet beyond predation.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:37.380 align:middle line:90%
Really that's what it's about.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.435 align:middle line:90%
So your final thoughts on this.

00:43:39.435 --> 00:43:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I think
that we should never

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:44.660 align:middle line:84%
underestimate the significance
and potential of humans.

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:45.920 align:middle line:90%
It's not that we're--

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Agree.

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.863 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: --better
than other things.

00:43:47.863 --> 00:43:49.500 align:middle line:84%
It's that we've
created for perfection.

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:50.750 align:middle line:90%
That's what the tablets state.

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:53.457 align:middle line:84%
That's not just my opinion,
just being egotistical

00:43:53.457 --> 00:43:55.040 align:middle line:84%
and that we're better
than everything.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.640 align:middle line:84%
The tablets specifically
state that in all of these

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:00.140 align:middle line:84%
experiments and all of these
things that are going on around

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:03.470 align:middle line:84%
the universe, that humans
here in this special place,

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:06.540 align:middle line:84%
this incredible Gaia, this
crystal-- which, by the way,

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:08.540 align:middle line:84%
you should point out the
significance of Earth--

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:11.720 align:middle line:84%
the dominant mineral type
here is silica quartz,

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.290 align:middle line:84%
meaning we're just
a giant crystal.

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:16.470 align:middle line:84%
So what can consciousness
do in a place like that?

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's where it
goes into the detail

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:22.430 align:middle line:84%
of this Adapa, this
perfected being,

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:26.420 align:middle line:84%
where if it can get past these
cycles, this game of cycles

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:29.660 align:middle line:84%
of catastrophe that want to
reset it, that whole idea to me

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.540 align:middle line:84%
is just because of
the game of overcoming

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:35.390 align:middle line:84%
these incredible odds because
of the potential of what

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:36.200 align:middle line:90%
it can become.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:36.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: I think that's
what this is all about

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:41.210 align:middle line:84%
is that we should never
underestimate what we can

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:42.810 align:middle line:90%
actually become in the future.

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:45.590 align:middle line:84%
We may be far greater
than we can even perceive.

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that
if we're in that gap

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:49.700 align:middle line:84%
right now, which I
believe and Billy does,

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.670 align:middle line:84%
this combination of
advanced technologies

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:54.740 align:middle line:84%
all coming together with
knowledge of the past

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality, all merging
at this particular time that's

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:02.420 align:middle line:84%
been prophesied by the Aztec
and the Maya and many others,

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:05.090 align:middle line:84%
that here we have this glimpse
where even though it seems

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:07.640 align:middle line:84%
like it's dire at times and
then we've lost ourselves

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:10.550 align:middle line:84%
in materialism and
consuming in other aspects,

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:13.190 align:middle line:84%
perhaps this is
where this story that

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:15.740 align:middle line:84%
seems to not have a
probable outcome, maybe it's

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:16.880 align:middle line:90%
the one that does.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:17.300 align:middle line:90%
It's the one--

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Maybe it does.

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: --that
truly makes it,

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.020 align:middle line:84%
that everyone at the
end of the movie goes,

00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:21.980 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see that coming.

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:22.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:24.068 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: Where
all of a sudden we

00:45:24.068 --> 00:45:27.190 align:middle line:84%
go somewhere that is completely
unique and different that it

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:28.940 align:middle line:84%
takes us to a new
chapter that we've never

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:30.815 align:middle line:90%
been able to achieve before.

00:45:30.815 --> 00:45:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:33.170 align:middle line:90%
And then that makes sense.

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:36.260 align:middle line:84%
That statement that I
read in a beautiful text

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:39.440 align:middle line:84%
that the angels bow
before the person who

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.900 align:middle line:84%
has been through this
journey, the human

00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:43.700 align:middle line:84%
and perfected themselves
because they've

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.440 align:middle line:84%
never been through
such challenge

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.480 align:middle line:90%
as what we go through every day.

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Every day.

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:50.115 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So, yay, humans.

00:45:50.115 --> 00:45:50.915 align:middle line:90%
Go, humans.

00:45:50.915 --> 00:45:52.110 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:53.690 align:middle line:90%
I am very pro-human.

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:56.030 align:middle line:84%
I know it looks bad at times,
but I'm very pro-human.

00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:57.613 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really glad
to see that that's

00:45:57.613 --> 00:45:59.030 align:middle line:90%
your vision for the future, too.

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, you have this amazing
200,000-year timeline graphic.

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So we will put that
up in the interview.

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:11.080 align:middle line:84%
But also, maybe you can
make it available to people.

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:12.740 align:middle line:10%
>>LACROIX: It
actually is right now.

00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:14.840 align:middle line:10%
You can go to my website
at the stageoftime.com,

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:18.420 align:middle line:10%
and I have that timeline on
one of the pages there as well.

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.098 align:middle line:84%
So it's something
where we want to--

00:46:20.098 --> 00:46:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's beautiful.

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:22.215 align:middle line:90%
Really interesting too.

00:46:22.215 --> 00:46:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>>LACROIX: We want
to rewrite the story

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.298 align:middle line:84%
but we want to do
it in a way where

00:46:25.298 --> 00:46:26.990 align:middle line:84%
we preserve as
many ancient texts

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:28.115 align:middle line:90%
where people can find them.

00:46:28.115 --> 00:46:30.323 align:middle line:84%
I have so many comments
where people say, well, where

00:46:30.323 --> 00:46:31.760 align:middle line:90%
do I find that text to read it?

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:32.810 align:middle line:90%
Where do I--

00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:35.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm buried in seven
different tablets.

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:38.330 align:middle line:84%
Where do I find that spot
that says specifically.

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:41.578 align:middle line:84%
This is the whole point is we
try to take the most important

00:46:41.578 --> 00:46:44.120 align:middle line:84%
of each one of these, whether
or not it's Sumerian, Akkadian,

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:48.918 align:middle line:84%
Babylonian, Gnostic,
Egyptian, the ancient Timaeus

00:46:48.918 --> 00:46:50.960 align:middle line:84%
and Critias from Solon
and the Egyptian knowledge

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.000 align:middle line:84%
from the Temple of Sais,
and many, many others,

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.210 align:middle line:84%
to put it all together and say,
here, we're going to make this

00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:58.670 align:middle line:84%
a time capsule of all
of our human knowledge

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:01.767 align:middle line:84%
so that we can move forward
and never lose it ever again.

00:47:01.767 --> 00:47:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excellent.

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Thank you both for taking, well,
lifetimes of energy and pursuit

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:08.820 align:middle line:90%
to make this happen.

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:10.290 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:12.637 align:middle line:84%
So as we move on here,
as your story progresses,

00:47:12.637 --> 00:47:14.720 align:middle line:84%
let me know and we'll come
back and do this again.

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CARSON: Fantastic.

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:15.770 align:middle line:90%
Sounds good.

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>>LACROIX: We would love to.

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:17.690 align:middle line:90%
