>>REGINA MEREDITH: You've
got a Buddhist monk,

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.990 align:middle line:84%
and you've got a
pagan witch mother.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.955 align:middle line:84%
What did they
inculcate into you?

00:00:13.955 --> 00:00:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SOPHIE STRAND: I like to say
I was raised in an understanding

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.260 align:middle line:84%
that no one faith held
the dominant worldview.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.930 align:middle line:84%
There is a problem
right now, which

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.990 align:middle line:84%
is that masculinity and
patriarchy have been conflated,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.110 align:middle line:84%
but masculinity was not
always about dominating.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.560 align:middle line:84%
There used to be a
biodiversity of masculinities.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Are there better myths
for the masculine

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.370 align:middle line:90%
than the hero's journey?

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Are they're sexier, wilder, more
ecologically-minded stories?

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.820 align:middle line:84%
For me, rewylding means
coming into relationship

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.660 align:middle line:84%
with the fungi, the plants,
the women, the queer people,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.390 align:middle line:84%
the disabled people, the
Indigenous populations,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.230 align:middle line:84%
and how can we literally root
masculinity back into place.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:01.770 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.150 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Imagine
what might come

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.310 align:middle line:10%
from being raised by
a former Buddhist monk

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.030 align:middle line:10%
father and a former Catholic
pagan witch mother, raised

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.360 align:middle line:10%
with all boys, and desiring
to have a boy herself one day.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Sophie Strand loves
men and has written

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.120 align:middle line:84%
her book, "The Flowering Wand,"
toward the end of refashioning

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.630 align:middle line:84%
the idea of masculinity
to one that is gentle

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.130 align:middle line:90%
and in connection with nature.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.450 align:middle line:90%
Is that fair enough to say?

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.510 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Sophie.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Hi.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
having me, Regina.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.360 align:middle line:10%
Yes, I think that's fair to say.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.770 align:middle line:10%
I also think that it
might be important to add

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.470 align:middle line:10%
that I have known great
violence at the hands of men

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.280 align:middle line:10%
and seeing that certain
types of masculine narratives

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.406 align:middle line:10%
have been very problematic.

00:01:43.406 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to get into that.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.527 align:middle line:84%
So let's start first
with what I brought up.

00:01:47.527 --> 00:01:49.860 align:middle line:84%
You've got a Buddhist monk,
and you've got a pagan witch

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.000 align:middle line:90%
mother, Catholic.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.330 align:middle line:84%
So what did they inculcate into
you and to your sense of belief

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.320 align:middle line:90%
as a little girl?

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to move
toward what happened more

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.705 align:middle line:84%
on the receiving end of the
less noble end of masculinity.

00:02:06.705 --> 00:02:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Yeah.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was very
lucky that my parents

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.880 align:middle line:84%
write about
spirituality, and are

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.820 align:middle line:84%
very curious, and willing
to practice anything,

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.680 align:middle line:84%
that they really
believe that everyone

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.680 align:middle line:84%
has their way of entering
into a sacred container.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.350 align:middle line:90%
And so I was--

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.710 align:middle line:84%
I like to say I was raised
in a compost heap of rabbis,

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.140 align:middle line:84%
and monks, and nuns,
and theologians,

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.790 align:middle line:84%
and mantric prayers,
and animals.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.850 align:middle line:84%
We had lots of spiritual
teachers in the house,

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.420 align:middle line:84%
but we also would
adopt hurt wildlife.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.210 align:middle line:84%
So it was a really interesting
mixture of animism,

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.730 align:middle line:84%
and a deep respect
for the natural world,

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.180 align:middle line:84%
and an understanding
that no one faith held

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.240 align:middle line:84%
the dominant worldview, and that
it was important to be curious

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and to look at everything really
carefully and compassionately.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
a good fertilizer

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.900 align:middle line:84%
to grow in from
that compost heap.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: Yeah, I
was pretty lucky.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.805 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:58.805 --> 00:03:00.982 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely,
because it certainly

00:03:00.982 --> 00:03:02.940 align:middle line:84%
helped you understand
there's no one prevailing

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.240 align:middle line:90%
view and a very open mind.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.040 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Yeah.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So amidst
all of this, what

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.930 align:middle line:84%
happened on a personal level
that had on the receiving

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.700 align:middle line:90%
end of some brutality?

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: Well, I am a
childhood sexual abuse survivor.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:84%
It happened outside
of my family,

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.710 align:middle line:84%
and I was very lucky
to have a family that

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.670 align:middle line:84%
cushioned that experience
and raised me in the dirt

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and in relationship with other
animals, with other plants,

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.280 align:middle line:84%
and with really wonderfully
tender people who have

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.200 align:middle line:90%
different stories to offer.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.020 align:middle line:84%
But that experience
has always shown me

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.565 align:middle line:90%
that there are bad narratives.

00:03:38.565 --> 00:03:39.365 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:39.365 --> 00:03:42.570 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: There are bad
experiences that cannot be

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.560 align:middle line:84%
escaped but that you
have to alchemize.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
I'm really interested in,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.650 align:middle line:84%
the stories that live in our
bodies somatically that are--

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.150 align:middle line:90%
feel indigestible.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.540 align:middle line:84%
What can we do with these
stories that feel like they

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.135 align:middle line:90%
cannot be broken down?

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How old
were you at the time?

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: I was three years old.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
were very little.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Yeah.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.455 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you were
conscious and remembered--

00:04:01.455 --> 00:04:02.130 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Yes.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.105 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --what
all had happened.

00:04:03.105 --> 00:04:03.905 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Mm-hmm.

00:04:03.905 --> 00:04:06.835 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How old were you
when you let your parents know

00:04:06.835 --> 00:04:07.635 align:middle line:90%
this happened?

00:04:07.635 --> 00:04:09.015 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: 26 years old.

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how did they
engage with you on this?

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.920 align:middle line:90%
Were they shocked?

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they did
not expect this.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: I think that
there were a lot of signs

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.230 align:middle line:90%
that it had happened.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.350 align:middle line:84%
I offer to a lot of people that
resilience is a good thing,

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.570 align:middle line:90%
but sometimes it's a bad thing.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.650 align:middle line:84%
I was a very resilient
child, very buoyant, and good

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.530 align:middle line:90%
at making friends.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it held
at bay the realization

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.770 align:middle line:84%
that something bad had
happened and that sometimes I

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.690 align:middle line:90%
wish I had broken down earlier.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And I suffer from pretty
intense physical illness,

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and I can see the direct
line between repressed trauma

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.455 align:middle line:90%
that I kept underground--

00:04:52.455 --> 00:04:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.490 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: --and how
it became embedded

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.220 align:middle line:84%
in my body rather
than lymphatically

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.845 align:middle line:90%
moved through my expression.

00:05:01.845 --> 00:05:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that makes sense.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the people I
just interviewed recently and I

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.690 align:middle line:84%
have a few times is a master
dowser who talked about what

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.710 align:middle line:84%
happens when trauma gets
stuck in the body that is--

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.580 align:middle line:90%
and you just use the word--

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.500 align:middle line:90%
undigestible--

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Yeah.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --where you
have no comprehension

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.982 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
wherefore, and the why,

00:05:21.982 --> 00:05:23.190 align:middle line:90%
and what's actually happened.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Yeah.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So for
you in your life,

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.005 align:middle line:90%
how did that start playing out?

00:05:28.005 --> 00:05:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: Well, I was a very
athletic, very creative,

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:34.950 align:middle line:90%
energetic kid.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.520 align:middle line:84%
I always knew
something was wrong.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.800 align:middle line:90%
I always felt like an alien.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.810 align:middle line:84%
But no one else noticed,
so that was good.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.700 align:middle line:84%
But had a sense that
there was a shadow world

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.210 align:middle line:84%
that I was definitely-- it was
taking a lot of physical effort

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.660 align:middle line:84%
to keep it away
from everyone else.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.420 align:middle line:84%
But I was very
healthy until I went

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.770 align:middle line:84%
to stay with family
in Jerusalem.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.940 align:middle line:90%
Part of my family is Israeli.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the
middle of Jerusalem

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.360 align:middle line:84%
and fell pretty
much deathly ill.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.340 align:middle line:90%
And we didn't know at the time.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.860 align:middle line:84%
It took about seven
years, but I have

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.620 align:middle line:84%
a genetic connective
tissue disease.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.900 align:middle line:90%
And it had kicked in then.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.260 align:middle line:84%
It often for women kicks in
around puberty and hormonal

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.400 align:middle line:90%
fluctuations.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.593 align:middle line:90%
But it kicked in very intensely.

00:06:23.593 --> 00:06:24.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What was it?

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.468 align:middle line:90%
What were the symptoms?

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: I was having all
sorts of different organ issues.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.020 align:middle line:84%
My gastrointestinal
system shut down.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.800 align:middle line:84%
My kidneys started
to malfunction.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your being was
shutting down and rebelling.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: It was.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.407 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: It was
shouting and screaming.

00:06:36.407 --> 00:06:39.250 align:middle line:84%
It was saying, you will not
express this with your words,

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.460 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to have
to start showing it.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.405 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:42.405 --> 00:06:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: And it was always
interesting because my brother

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.020 align:middle line:84%
has the same genetic
composition and yet pretty much,

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.810 align:middle line:84%
but he's not ever demonstrated
this genetic condition.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:59.360 align:middle line:84%
So I have to think that the
trauma predisposed me to really

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.970 align:middle line:84%
have this illness in
quite the way that I have.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
reflecting back on it,

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.405 align:middle line:84%
what was it about your days in
Jerusalem that triggered this?

00:07:07.405 --> 00:07:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Well, I am not sure.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.350 align:middle line:90%
I have always been--

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.500 align:middle line:90%
it is interesting to me.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.870 align:middle line:84%
My parents now write a lot
about the divine feminine

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.500 align:middle line:84%
and about pagan practices that
are stowaways in Catholicism,

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.950 align:middle line:84%
and they're very interested
in the early pagan

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.300 align:middle line:90%
origins of Christianity.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.220 align:middle line:84%
But they were not
when I was growing up.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.980 align:middle line:84%
It was mostly a
Buddhist-Jewish culture.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.980 align:middle line:84%
But I was obsessed with
the story of Jesus,

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.430 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't really know why.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't obsessed with it
in a necessarily spiritual way.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.340 align:middle line:90%
I was curious about it.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.980 align:middle line:84%
I felt like there
was pain there,

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.490 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't
understand what it was.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think when I
got to Jerusalem,

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.800 align:middle line:90%
that story came alive in me.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I
wanted to write about it

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:58.520 align:middle line:84%
and to understand the
historical, political, social

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.915 align:middle line:84%
context that had created
such a black swan event.

00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:04.235 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:04.235 --> 00:08:06.740 align:middle line:84%
That's a good way to put
it-- a black swan event.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.860 align:middle line:84%
So did you start, at
that time, doing anything

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.794 align:middle line:84%
to begin moving
this through you?

00:08:12.794 --> 00:08:13.598 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: No.

00:08:13.598 --> 00:08:15.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was in denial.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.440 align:middle line:84%
This was many years before
I'd had any exposure

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.950 align:middle line:84%
to somatic therapy
or an understanding

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.010 align:middle line:84%
that the body could
somatize trauma.

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.750 align:middle line:90%


00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.630 align:middle line:84%
I quickly became pretty
life-threateningly ill with

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.239 align:middle line:84%
going in and out of having
anaphylactic shock every other

00:08:33.239 --> 00:08:34.039 align:middle line:90%
day--

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my god.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.599 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: --for a period
of time, in and out

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:35.780 align:middle line:90%
of the hospital.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.715 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How terrifying
for everybody.

00:08:37.715 --> 00:08:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: And I think there
was a shifting point where

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.428 align:middle line:84%
I realized that when I
finally got the diagnosis,

00:08:44.428 --> 00:08:46.220 align:middle line:84%
they were like, here's
a condition that has

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.300 align:middle line:90%
no cure and no real treatment.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I said,
OK, what can I do?

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:52.830 align:middle line:90%
What else is there?

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.187 align:middle line:84%
When you think that
the door is locked,

00:08:55.187 --> 00:08:56.520 align:middle line:90%
there's a window open somewhere.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.060 align:middle line:90%
You have to look around.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, I'm
going to try everything.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to wiggle.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to see if I
can dance a little bit.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
started to find out

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:11.220 align:middle line:84%
that it might be bad for my
body that I kept this a secret.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: And so
I started to talk.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so at 26, it
really started coming forward.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Yeah.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I
asked you earlier.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.180 align:middle line:90%
How did your parents respond?

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: They were
incredibly supportive.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:28.290 align:middle line:84%
But I also think that the
science behind certain kinds

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.180 align:middle line:84%
of PTSD treatment
is still in process,

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:35.010 align:middle line:84%
and I think they didn't
know exactly how to help me.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's still an
ongoing experience

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.570 align:middle line:84%
that I'm navigating
with other people

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.870 align:middle line:84%
with PTSD, which is it's
not about solving this.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a narrative inside of
capitalism of constant progress

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.880 align:middle line:90%
and of completing something.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.020 align:middle line:90%
This will not complete.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.970 align:middle line:90%
This is a dance partner.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And I will be doing this
tricky dance for a long time.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Maybe after this show, we
can talk about a couple

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.100 align:middle line:84%
of people who I
know that are-- this

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.452 align:middle line:84%
is their thing-- is helping
to clear some of this,

00:10:01.452 --> 00:10:02.910 align:middle line:84%
just so you can go
into partnership

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:03.900 align:middle line:90%
with different people.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:04.700 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Yes.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then you can
help other experiencers

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:10.170 align:middle line:84%
like yourself do the
same because it's

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.320 align:middle line:84%
something I can't fathom
what that does to a being.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.690 align:middle line:84%
But I think everybody
listening, many of whom

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.230 align:middle line:84%
have had the same
experience, can.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.870 align:middle line:84%
So let's go on to now your
conscious mind kicks in.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.010 align:middle line:90%
You're wiggling.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.270 align:middle line:90%
You're dancing.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And your parents are talking
about the sacred feminine

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.280 align:middle line:90%
and writing about it.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And you are now trying
to find a new lens

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.740 align:middle line:84%
through which to
look at masculinity

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.390 align:middle line:90%
that's not that lens.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Yeah.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how did you begin
that part of your journey?

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.020 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: Well,
it's so interesting.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.710 align:middle line:84%
So I was raised by
really kind men,

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.490 align:middle line:84%
like really, really kind
men, but men who I also saw

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:56.790 align:middle line:84%
had been deprived of fertile
options of emotional expression

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.670 align:middle line:90%
and narrative possibilities.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.500 align:middle line:84%
In particular, I
saw my grandfather,

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.110 align:middle line:84%
who is the son of an
Irish immigrant, who

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.680 align:middle line:84%
wanted to be a writer,
who was bisexual

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.170 align:middle line:84%
but felt like he had to
hide that part of himself,

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:15.030 align:middle line:84%
and had to become a surgeon, and
kept a lot of himself secret.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And I love my
grandfather so much,

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.310 align:middle line:84%
and he gave me books and
taught me how to paint.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.180 align:middle line:84%
But I also saw that there were
parts of him that were never

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:29.610 align:middle line:84%
allowed expression, and that
became anger, and resentment,

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:35.200 align:middle line:84%
and certain kinds of sexism
that were working through him.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, when I first
started working with my trauma,

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.350 align:middle line:84%
I went fully into
the divine feminine.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was hosting
gatherings for women

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:84%
where we would tell stories
about our lives, the violence,

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.340 align:middle line:90%
the beauty, medical issues.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And those felt so
safe and womb-like.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.390 align:middle line:84%
But we realized
that they were never

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:02.930 align:middle line:84%
going to change the culture
if we didn't invite men

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.590 align:middle line:90%
to the conversation.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:06.770 align:middle line:90%
And then COVID happened.

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:11.540 align:middle line:84%
So during COVID, I decided to
personally try and compost,

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.880 align:middle line:84%
throw on the pile of
these bad experiences,

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.670 align:middle line:84%
the good experiences,
and say, are there

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.270 align:middle line:84%
better myths for the masculine
than the hero's journey,

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:24.170 align:middle line:84%
than the king who slays
dragons, than the prince who

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:25.910 align:middle line:90%
always saves the princess?

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Are there sexier, wilder, more
ecologically-minded stories?

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And I did not think this
was going to be a book.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.270 align:middle line:84%
It was really just
an exploration.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:42.290 align:middle line:84%
I actually shared it online
in bite-sized portions

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.060 align:middle line:90%
to see if people resonated.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And within a week of sharing
these little excerpts online,

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:54.060 align:middle line:84%
3,000 people had showed
up saying, we need these.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.820 align:middle line:84%
So it was a participatory--
it was an experience.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Doing this work was about
complicating the idea

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.740 align:middle line:90%
of the individual author.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.160 align:middle line:84%
It was about everyone
coming on board and helping,

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.713 align:middle line:84%
and that felt healing too,
which is men, I think,

00:13:07.713 --> 00:13:09.630 align:middle line:84%
always feel like they
have to do things alone.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:10.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.582 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: And so to do a
project about masculinity that

00:13:12.582 --> 00:13:16.470 align:middle line:84%
was inherently communal
felt important.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.010 align:middle line:84%
OK, so in the book, you
make this statement.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.210 align:middle line:84%
"The divine feminine
is not big enough."

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Mm-hmm.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now let's go
to that end of the story.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.610 align:middle line:84%
What did you mean by "the divine
feminine is not big enough"

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:30.520 align:middle line:90%
for me?

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: I'm very interested
in science, and biology,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.810 align:middle line:84%
and physics, and how,
in a strange way,

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:40.352 align:middle line:84%
older myths seem to mirror
the discoveries in science

00:13:40.352 --> 00:13:41.560 align:middle line:90%
that are happening right now.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
mutually exclusive.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:84%
They actually inform and
infiltrate each other

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.880 align:middle line:90%
in really interesting ways.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking about how
divine feminine can locate us

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.390 align:middle line:84%
problematically in the human,
that it's not a bad word,

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:00.090 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't quite
feel big enough

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:06.060 align:middle line:84%
for the entangled ecosystems
that feel like a mother to me,

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.810 align:middle line:84%
that it's multiple trees, and
mycorrhizal fungi, and orchids,

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.660 align:middle line:84%
and bacteria, and
soil, that none of us

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.180 align:middle line:90%
are necessarily one gender.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you can't
flatten it to one dimension,

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.000 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.105 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: One dimension.

00:14:18.105 --> 00:14:19.105 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: One dimension.

00:14:19.105 --> 00:14:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: And I think divine
feminine was a safe survival

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.730 align:middle line:84%
mechanism for me, where
it was a place where

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.320 align:middle line:90%
no men could come in.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think when I say divine
feminine wasn't big enough

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.730 align:middle line:84%
is I needed to be
brave, and I needed

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:33.450 align:middle line:84%
to open up the door to
unexpected possibilities,

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.810 align:middle line:84%
and to cross-pollination
with beings, and people,

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:42.070 align:middle line:84%
and landscapes I wouldn't
necessarily consider safe.

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So was this
a matter of curiosity,

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.635 align:middle line:90%
or courage, or both?

00:14:46.635 --> 00:14:50.520 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: I would say curiosity
and that I'm very scared.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.440 align:middle line:90%
But one time--

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I think it was my father,
although he denies it--

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.057 align:middle line:84%
he says I made this up-- said,
happiness is an act of bravery,

00:14:58.057 --> 00:14:59.640 align:middle line:84%
that if you want to
be happy, you have

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.150 align:middle line:90%
to do something terrifying.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.070 align:middle line:90%
You have to leap.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:06.450 align:middle line:84%
So I would say it was me trying
to leap into happiness that I

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.310 align:middle line:84%
didn't know how it
would happen, but it

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.335 align:middle line:90%
would take an act of bravery.

00:15:10.335 --> 00:15:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you for that.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.470 align:middle line:84%
So "The Flowering
Wand"-- the book's

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:14.637 align:middle line:90%
called "The Flowering Wand."

00:15:14.637 --> 00:15:16.260 align:middle line:84%
What does that mean
metaphorically?

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: [LAUGHS] Well,
it's a little bit of a pun.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And the joke is that I
came up with the title as--

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.555 align:middle line:84%
on the fly before an
interview and didn't

00:15:25.555 --> 00:15:26.430 align:middle line:90%
think it would stick.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And it did stick, and everyone
said, you have to keep it.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:35.685 align:middle line:84%
It refers to Dionysus,
that ancient pre-Greek god

00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:38.430 align:middle line:84%
of fermentation
and revelry, and he

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:43.170 align:middle line:84%
had a fennel stalk he would
show up with that would flower.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.690 align:middle line:84%
It also refers to
Joseph of Arimathea

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.870 align:middle line:84%
and his flowering wand
and to, I believe,

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:50.550 align:middle line:84%
the angel Gabriel
and his flowering

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:53.010 align:middle line:84%
wand that he brings to
the Annunciation, which

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:57.450 align:middle line:84%
is these masculine figures
who kind of complicate

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:00.877 align:middle line:84%
the idea of the man
as holding the staff--

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The sword.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: --the sword
that divides and is the--

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Bring fertility,
and growth, and beauty.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Yes.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:08.380 align:middle line:90%
Something will sprout from it.

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.010 align:middle line:84%
So I really love that,
that the sword divides.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.530 align:middle line:84%
It tries to under-- it's
material reductionism,

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:84%
dividing things into parts
so you can understand them

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:21.060 align:middle line:84%
and that the wand connects,
and it transforms.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.610 align:middle line:84%
So it transforms us
into different minds

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.700 align:middle line:84%
and different beings so that we
can have an expanded empathy.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
beautifully put.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.850 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk-- you just
hinted at it a moment ago.

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:33.840 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into
Bacchus or Dionysus,

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and let's go into
Pan and Orpheus.

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:37.830 align:middle line:90%
And you call them the more--

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.680 align:middle line:84%
the time when the gods
were more playful.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:44.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's speak about that and
what you mean by that and this

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:48.540 align:middle line:84%
whole notion of
rewylding, W-Y-L-D-I-N-G.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Mm-hmm.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So I think there is
a problem right now,

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:58.010 align:middle line:84%
which is that masculinity and
patriarchy have been conflated,

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:01.610 align:middle line:84%
but masculinity was not
always about dominating,

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:05.180 align:middle line:84%
and about extracting,
and harming.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:09.260 align:middle line:84%
There used to be a
biodiversity of masculinities

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.730 align:middle line:90%
pretty recently.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of them is
being like mycorrhizal systems,

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:21.260 align:middle line:84%
which is fungi grow below
grond and connect forests,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.270 align:middle line:84%
but then they fruit
up as mushrooms.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And the mushrooms
look like individuals,

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.090 align:middle line:84%
but they're really just a
small reproductive flourish

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:32.420 align:middle line:84%
of much larger, older
systems below ground.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And so as I was looking at
older mythic characters,

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.640 align:middle line:84%
like Orpheus, and Dionysus,
and Attis, and Adonis.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.870 align:middle line:84%
I said, they all seem very
similar, but they're different.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.510 align:middle line:90%
How do I understand that?

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.250 align:middle line:84%
I was like, what if
they're all mushrooms

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:53.120 align:middle line:84%
of the same underground
mythic mycelium

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.610 align:middle line:84%
but that they're
particularly responding

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:57.830 align:middle line:84%
to certain places,
and social concerns,

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:59.990 align:middle line:90%
and climatological pressures?

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:03.590 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it was understanding
these playful gods

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:07.130 align:middle line:84%
as being deeply in
conversation with land,

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.800 align:middle line:84%
that they are the voice
of the land speaking

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.410 align:middle line:84%
to itself, teaching us how
to be in right relationship

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:16.460 align:middle line:84%
with exactly where we live
so that Dionysus, whenever he

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.350 align:middle line:90%
arrives, is called a stranger.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.930 align:middle line:84%
He's always given
new attributes.

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Like sometimes he
has short hair.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.260 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes he has rosy cheeks.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.550 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes he's more feminine.

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:25.805 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes--

00:18:25.805 --> 00:18:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as
Bacchus, he represents

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:28.400 align:middle line:90%
the great feast of life.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Exactly.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.610 align:middle line:84%
But what he is is
he's adaptable.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.390 align:middle line:84%
That I see the
monomyth as patriarchy

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:37.940 align:middle line:90%
is about stability and rigidity.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And Bacchus and
Dionysus is very able

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.540 align:middle line:84%
to respond and adapt
to what is needed.

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And that felt like a
very important gift

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:52.400 align:middle line:84%
to plant back into the soil
of masculine narratives.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and where does
the-- when I think about it

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and then I think of
Pan, I think of also

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:01.280 align:middle line:84%
kind of the elemental kingdom
and how the elemental kingdom

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.360 align:middle line:84%
plays into who the
gods were and what they

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.950 align:middle line:90%
were known as once upon a time.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Can you speak to
that a little bit?

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:11.270 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Well, I think that--

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:14.540 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes say that
Jesus is a fungal god,

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.860 align:middle line:84%
and I say that certain--
because the smalls, the viruses,

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:23.090 align:middle line:84%
bacterias, and microbes, that
hurt us but also make our foods

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:25.212 align:middle line:84%
and make the wine that
changes our minds--

00:19:25.212 --> 00:19:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that our
bodies are comprised of.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Yes, exactly.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Because they were invisible
before the microscope,

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.360 align:middle line:84%
we created deities to
be them, or maybe we

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.190 align:middle line:84%
didn't create
deities to be them.

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:39.600 align:middle line:84%
The deities arrived
that were them.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.890 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes I think
of these vegetal gods

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.690 align:middle line:84%
of the Mediterranean
Basin as being

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:47.570 align:middle line:84%
these elemental
microbial gods that

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:50.840 align:middle line:84%
are the voice of this
more-than-human energy

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:57.280 align:middle line:84%
of fermentation and
life-giving festivity.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how do you
see that influence coming

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:05.830 align:middle line:84%
back into play in
today's world with what

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:10.240 align:middle line:84%
masculinity is being portrayed
as, which is all over the map?

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.555 align:middle line:90%
I mean, nobody really--

00:20:11.555 --> 00:20:13.180 align:middle line:84%
men are having a hard
time figuring out

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.880 align:middle line:84%
what exactly is that even
supposed to mean anymore

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.530 align:middle line:90%
in terms of roles and so forth.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And, like, how do you see
this more elemental kind

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:27.345 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge playing back into
help form the new masculinity?

00:20:27.345 --> 00:20:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: Well, I always want to
hesitate with new masculinity.

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:35.990 align:middle line:84%
I want to offer a probiotic
of masculinity, a biodiversity

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:37.220 align:middle line:90%
of masculinities.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think the issue is
always when we try and replace

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.960 align:middle line:90%
one thing with another thing.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And the metaphor I've been
using is of narrative dysbiosis,

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.100 align:middle line:84%
that when you take
too many antibiotics,

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.050 align:middle line:84%
you kill off all the
microbes in your gut

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:55.050 align:middle line:84%
and a monologuing pathogen
like Candida can take over.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think of
patriarchal masculinity

00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:59.960 align:middle line:84%
as being like a
monologuing pathogen.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is to not
put just one other bacteria

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:06.140 align:middle line:84%
into the cultural
gut but to put many.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And so what I was attempting
to do in this book

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.490 align:middle line:84%
is to offer
Dionysus, who teaches

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:13.790 align:middle line:84%
about listening to invasive
species and to vegetation,

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:19.160 align:middle line:84%
learning how fermentation
and local food operations are

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.980 align:middle line:84%
important to the masculine--
so Dionysus teaches

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:27.260 align:middle line:84%
a lot about being playful,
being in relationship to plants

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:28.610 align:middle line:90%
and also to women.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Dionysus was very involved with
women shaking off the bounds

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.935 align:middle line:90%
of the cultural expectations.

00:21:36.935 --> 00:21:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And that was why he was
considered dangerous.

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: So I would say that
Dionysus teaches the masculine

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:48.560 align:middle line:84%
how to help the feminine escape
the bounds of patriarchy.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.310 align:middle line:10%
But I also wanted to offer
other options because when--

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:55.970 align:middle line:10%
it's always healthier to
take the full probiotic.

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:57.740 align:middle line:84%
So then there's
Orpheus who does it

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.370 align:middle line:84%
through music and
through falling in love

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:04.190 align:middle line:84%
and letting that love
guide him into a wilder

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:09.530 align:middle line:84%
relationship with his-- all
of the birds, and the lions,

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.930 align:middle line:90%
and the stones in his ecosystem.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:15.500 align:middle line:84%
He becomes the mouthpiece for
the more-than-human world.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And then there's someone
like King David, who

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.790 align:middle line:84%
takes off all his clothes
and refuses armor before he

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:25.250 align:middle line:90%
goes to defeat Goliath.

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:28.820 align:middle line:84%
David could be someone who is
helping someone with trauma

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.070 align:middle line:84%
and understands
that vulnerability

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.220 align:middle line:90%
is how you defeat the monsters.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he, himself,
was a very complex character.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:36.750 align:middle line:90%
Had his bugaboos.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: He did, indeed.

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] So
we have to understand

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:44.647 align:middle line:84%
we're taking the highest
traits of each of these beings.

00:22:44.647 --> 00:22:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: We're composting them.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.522 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're
composting them, yes.

00:22:47.522 --> 00:22:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: And I think that's--
one of the big things is no

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:54.500 align:middle line:84%
story from 2,000 years ago from
many countries away is going

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.078 align:middle line:84%
to be ecologically adapted
to this current moment.

00:22:57.078 --> 00:22:57.995 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:22:57.995 --> 00:22:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: So how can we--

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.890 align:middle line:84%
my thing I say is
reroute, rewild, retell,

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:08.120 align:middle line:84%
which is you can't expect this
to be adapted to where you are,

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.610 align:middle line:84%
but you can compost it
with modern science,

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:13.400 align:middle line:84%
with philosophy, with
your own sensibility

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.870 align:middle line:90%
to make a new mushroom.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:15.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:16.670 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:18.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, so another thing
that you stated

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.650 align:middle line:84%
was that as you went deeper
into myth and to science,

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:26.300 align:middle line:84%
it began blurring the whole
idea of what gender is.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.025 align:middle line:90%
What did you mean by that?

00:23:28.025 --> 00:23:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: I saw that queerness
is ubiquitous in nature,

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:39.020 align:middle line:84%
and that gender is deeply messy
and strange in other species

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:43.670 align:middle line:84%
and maybe even in our species,
and that I have been thinking

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:49.160 align:middle line:84%
lately of gender as being
kind of like a morphic field,

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:53.570 align:middle line:84%
a pattern of behavior, and that
the more it happens, the more--

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:55.460 align:middle line:90%
the easier it is to step into.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:57.170 align:middle line:90%
But it's not the only field.

00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And so perhaps you're
in the feminine,

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:02.420 align:middle line:84%
but you can also
feel that there are--

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.170 align:middle line:84%
there's a rhizomatic continuity
that leads into the masculine

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.220 align:middle line:90%
and to--

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.050 align:middle line:90%
lichen is a great example.

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:12.970 align:middle line:84%
I love to use ecological
metaphors, which is--

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What you do
throughout the book.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: I do.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.780 align:middle line:84%
Lichen for me--
so I was thinking

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.650 align:middle line:84%
about the hieros gamos, and
about the divine feminine

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:23.630 align:middle line:84%
and the sacred
masculine union, and how

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:25.760 align:middle line:84%
it didn't feel sexy
and big enough for me.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.200 align:middle line:90%
It felt too static.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.210 align:middle line:90%
How can I compost this?

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And I thought of
lichen, which look

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.660 align:middle line:84%
like a single little
leathery being growing

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.180 align:middle line:84%
on a gravestone or a
stone, but they're really

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:43.070 align:middle line:84%
a strange anarchic collaboration
of fungi, algae, yeast,

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:49.310 align:middle line:84%
and bacteria all combining
together and into symbiosis

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and that symbiosis actually
is the evolutionary refrain

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:57.620 align:middle line:84%
of our entire world,
that our very cells are

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:00.140 align:middle line:84%
the product of
anarchic lovemaking

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:05.330 align:middle line:84%
by early prokaryotic cells
and bacterial cells that

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:08.630 align:middle line:84%
merged together to create
our nucleated cells.

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And so our very
bodies are the product

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.960 align:middle line:84%
of lovemaking that
is not gendered.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And so it's less about
there not being gender.

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:24.220 align:middle line:84%
It's that gender is perhaps
wilder than the human.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:28.540 align:middle line:90%
And then let's go cosmically.

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, when you look
at it from maybe a more

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:36.760 align:middle line:84%
flat or one-dimensional point
of view, that nature and gender,

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.650 align:middle line:84%
you can't really
separate the two out

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:43.060 align:middle line:84%
with trees, and flowers, and
animals, that we have polarity,

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:47.170 align:middle line:84%
and that polarity is
necessary just for propagation

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:48.290 align:middle line:90%
of all these species.

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Yes.

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how does a being
enter the world with what

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.110 align:middle line:84%
you're-- the way
you're viewing it here,

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:58.990 align:middle line:84%
this notion that
it's a much wilder,

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:01.960 align:middle line:84%
more diverse proposition
than we can imagine?

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:07.420 align:middle line:84%
How do we enter as a species
psychologically into that world

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:12.070 align:middle line:84%
when the need for
polarity must exist just

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.980 align:middle line:90%
to continue procreating alone?

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: Well, I always say
it's the gradient that draws

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.250 align:middle line:84%
the stream from the top of
the mountain into the valley

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:25.270 align:middle line:90%
and creates--

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:27.580 align:middle line:90%
that carves that stream.

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's the differences
that make a landscape.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:33.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the differences
that bring us into being.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm very much wary of
homogenizing universalisms

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:42.610 align:middle line:84%
and androgyny or animism as
being these blanket phrases

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.320 align:middle line:84%
that we use to
erase differences.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And it is those
differences that create

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.790 align:middle line:84%
sexual tension, that
create narrative tension

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:50.590 align:middle line:90%
and propulsion.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:53.630 align:middle line:84%
So you're not saying
to erase this.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Oh, no.

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:58.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying that to
know that sometimes Dionysus

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.540 align:middle line:84%
shows up as a man and
sometimes Dionysus shows up

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:04.870 align:middle line:84%
with bull horns, and
breasts, and a phallus,

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:10.330 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes your lover
will be outside of legibility.

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And that difference might be
even sexier than the one that

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:14.725 align:middle line:90%
lives inside a binary.

00:27:14.725 --> 00:27:17.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you think
basically that is

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.560 align:middle line:84%
where we're headed as a
species, into that level

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:25.780 align:middle line:84%
of understanding or kind of
vastness of open-mindedness

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:26.590 align:middle line:90%
possibly.

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:28.060 align:middle line:84%
That's where you're
going for sure,

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.010 align:middle line:90%
and that means others are.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: I like to
say that I'm trying

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.850 align:middle line:84%
to disagree with myself every
day and to change my mind.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:41.920 align:middle line:84%
And as a survivor of
trauma, I put great value

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.770 align:middle line:84%
in stable value systems,
and wanting them,

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to understand what's
happening so that I feel safe.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:48.535 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That makes sense.

00:27:48.535 --> 00:27:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: So I don't want to
deny the need for understanding

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.468 align:middle line:90%
how certain things come to be.

00:27:54.468 --> 00:27:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The structure
of certain systems.

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Yeah.

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:00.505 align:middle line:90%
And I really see the usefulness.

00:28:00.505 --> 00:28:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have two parts
of yourself that are operating,

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:05.417 align:middle line:90%
questioning each other it seems.

00:28:05.417 --> 00:28:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: I think
I'm in conversation.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.375 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
we're heading,

00:28:08.375 --> 00:28:12.310 align:middle line:84%
but I do think that there's some
interesting conversations that

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:15.800 align:middle line:84%
are being added into
the mixing bowl.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's go
back to the gods.

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:19.330 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
you talked about

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:23.530 align:middle line:84%
is the common myth of male gods
killing the symbolic feminine.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, and this obviously
would be the part of you

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:29.770 align:middle line:84%
that is examining the
disturbed patriarchy,

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:31.120 align:middle line:90%
distorted patriarchy.

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Well--

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:35.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The examples you used
were Apollo and Python, Marduk,

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:36.100 align:middle line:90%
Tiamat, and so forth.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:36.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: I like to say that
monster myths are mother myths

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:45.160 align:middle line:84%
and that when you see a myth
where a hero slays a monster,

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:49.330 align:middle line:84%
it's a retelling of an
older pre-patriarchal myth

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:52.210 align:middle line:84%
where the mother goddess
is turned into a monster

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:54.970 align:middle line:90%
and must be vanquished.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:58.930 align:middle line:84%
One of the best examples is
Tiamat being killed by Marduk,

00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:01.210 align:middle line:84%
but Tiamat was the
older mother goddess

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:06.850 align:middle line:84%
that needed to be obliterated so
that the new dominant hierarchy

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:07.780 align:middle line:90%
could take over.

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:13.540 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard to erase a
belief in a sacred feminine,

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:15.760 align:middle line:90%
so you have to transform it.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
to be very proactive.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:21.880 align:middle line:84%
What's coming to me as you're
talking is look at modern times

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.580 align:middle line:84%
and what happened with
the Disney corporation.

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:25.570 align:middle line:90%
The mother dies.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:28.060 align:middle line:84%
From "Bambi" on, the
mother is always dead.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.765 align:middle line:84%
And these girls
have a father who

00:29:29.765 --> 00:29:31.390 align:middle line:84%
has to figure out
what to do with them,

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and all sorts of scenarios
spring from that.

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:37.990 align:middle line:84%
How do you perceive that
of what was going on there?

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Is it just the modern day
version of the gods killing off

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.480 align:middle line:90%
the monstrous females?

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- it's different because
it leaves a female vulnerable

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.190 align:middle line:90%
with no mother figure.

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: I think it actually,
interestingly enough, for me,

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:55.660 align:middle line:84%
represents the feeling
that none of us have--

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:59.020 align:middle line:84%
feel like we're in contact
with healthy ancestors,

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:02.480 align:middle line:84%
with our elders who knew
how to do this correctly.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.820 align:middle line:90%
So the mother is dead.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.450 align:middle line:90%
But the mother isn't dead.

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:09.190 align:middle line:84%
The mother is just so far back
that she feels like she's gone,

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and our job is to go and
try and get her and add

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:13.597 align:middle line:90%
her back into the conversation.

00:30:13.597 --> 00:30:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, I've
always wondered about this.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.097 align:middle line:84%
Why would the
Disney corporation--

00:30:17.097 --> 00:30:19.720 align:middle line:84%
why would Walt Disney
create this repetitive

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.150 align:middle line:90%
trauma for children?

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: I think we also
don't want to see mothers.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Once you're a mother, you
are supposed to stay at home.

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:28.842 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed to
be part of the story.

00:30:28.842 --> 00:30:30.440 align:middle line:90%
You exit the story.

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.380 align:middle line:84%
You're supposed to be either
a maiden or a crone who

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:36.500 align:middle line:84%
is the monster, and
that mothering often

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.870 align:middle line:90%
goes on behind a veil.

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:40.468 align:middle line:84%
So that would be
my interpretation.

00:30:40.468 --> 00:30:41.885 align:middle line:84%
I always found it
very disturbing.

00:30:41.885 --> 00:30:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Me too.

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: It made me not
want to watch the movies.

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:48.020 align:middle line:84%
I would be immediately terrified
my own mother would die.

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:53.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, perhaps it's also a
kind of insidious programming

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:58.000 align:middle line:84%
of young women to believe that
they will be done away with,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.040 align:middle line:84%
that they must stay
young women, that

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.660 align:middle line:90%
to become a mother is to die.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:02.860 align:middle line:90%
To age is to die.

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:05.170 align:middle line:84%
You have to stay inside
that princess role.

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:06.873 align:middle line:90%
You can never become the queen.

00:31:06.873 --> 00:31:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As good
a theory as any.

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:10.090 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
be inside his head

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:12.790 align:middle line:84%
when he created all
of these storylines.

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:15.520 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now let's go to
more magical masculine.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Go away from that into Merlin.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.010 align:middle line:84%
You have a real love
for Merlin, the Merlin

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:23.590 align:middle line:84%
figure in the Arthurian
legends and such.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:24.715 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:31:24.715 --> 00:31:25.690 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Yes.

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:27.460 align:middle line:90%
I studied Merlin in college.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I just think he is the
wildest character, especially

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:34.000 align:middle line:84%
because he may have
been a collection

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.490 align:middle line:84%
of actual historical
bards in England

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:39.070 align:middle line:84%
that then were conflated
into one magical figure

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:43.750 align:middle line:84%
by Geoffrey of Monmouth,
who pretty much gave birth

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:46.750 align:middle line:90%
to the Arthurian tales.

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And for me, Merlin is a
very interesting character

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:53.230 align:middle line:84%
in that he teaches kings
and he teaches kings

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:56.770 align:middle line:84%
how to take care of kingdoms,
and yet he goes mad and must

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:57.640 align:middle line:90%
go to the forest.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And the place that he gets
his prophetic magical ability

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:02.890 align:middle line:84%
is not in the world
of men, but it's

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:05.800 align:middle line:84%
in the world of
many, many species

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and that it's that intersection,
that overlap that gives him

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.000 align:middle line:90%
his particularly potent magic.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.650 align:middle line:84%
I also very much love the story
of how when he was a young boy,

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:22.490 align:middle line:84%
he was fatherless, knowing
who his father was.

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And Vortigern, who
was a vicious warlord,

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:29.900 align:middle line:84%
was trying to build a tower that
kept toppling again and again.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And he was told by
his magicians that he

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.370 align:middle line:84%
had to spill the blood
of a fatherless child

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:39.290 align:middle line:90%
in order to build the tower.

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And so he summons
Merlin not knowing

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:43.220 align:middle line:90%
that this is a magical child.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And the most amazing
thing is Vortigern

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.730 align:middle line:84%
is about to murder
Merlin, and Merlin goes,

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:51.860 align:middle line:90%
who told you to do this?

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Little boy says, who told--
who gave you this information?

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And Vortigern says,
it was my magicians.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Merlin says, take me
down below the towers.

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:02.790 align:middle line:90%
Let me fix this.

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that is really
the most dynamic part

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:11.300 align:middle line:84%
of the Merlin story, which is
magical boyhood interrupting

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.760 align:middle line:84%
the patterns of
patriarchy, saying

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.920 align:middle line:84%
who told you this was the
only way things could happen?

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.150 align:middle line:90%
I will not be killed.

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:19.700 align:middle line:90%
I will not be silenced.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.270 align:middle line:90%
I will not be erased.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:24.080 align:middle line:84%
I am going to be much
wilder than you expected.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And the most amazing
thing about it

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.850 align:middle line:84%
is Merlin doesn't
destroy Vortigern.

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:30.650 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't fight back.

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:33.200 align:middle line:84%
He questions him, and
it's the questions

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.740 align:middle line:84%
that have the most
power in them in fairy

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.150 align:middle line:90%
tales and magical stories.

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So where does
the druidic culture

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.470 align:middle line:90%
weave into all of this for you?

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: Druidic
culture-- I mean,

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.270 align:middle line:84%
druidic culture was
actually relatively recent

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:50.240 align:middle line:84%
in England as far as
my Dark Ages history

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:51.380 align:middle line:90%
when the Romans came in.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.870 align:middle line:84%
But it was the first
mode of English culture

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:55.370 align:middle line:84%
that the Romans
encountered, so it's

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:57.500 align:middle line:90%
the one we have most access to.

00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:58.715 align:middle line:90%
I actually personally--

00:33:58.715 --> 00:34:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because those
two cultures clashed.

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Clashed.

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The Romans with all
their efficiency and armament

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:09.130 align:middle line:84%
and the druidic living
with the land tribal men.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:11.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: They tried to
absolutely erase them

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.162 align:middle line:90%
and did quite a good job.

00:34:12.162 --> 00:34:14.203 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They did a good
job of wiping them out.

00:34:14.203 --> 00:34:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: And I think Merlin was
part of that druidic culture,

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:17.300 align:middle line:90%
which is--

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do too.

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: --very focused
on mantric magic sound.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I really
believe that it all

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:22.909 align:middle line:90%
had to do with music and sound.

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:24.784 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even the
druidic alphabet is trees.

00:34:24.784 --> 00:34:26.120 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Exactly.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:27.170 align:middle line:90%
But I also--

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I have a sense that the
Merlin character predates

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:34.580 align:middle line:84%
even the druidic culture,
that is adopted and enriched

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.860 align:middle line:90%
by druidic culture.

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:40.670 align:middle line:84%
But that magical
figure who goes wild,

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:43.070 align:middle line:84%
the mad man, green
man figure, predates

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.444 align:middle line:90%
even the druidic culture.

00:34:44.444 --> 00:34:45.244 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:45.244 --> 00:34:49.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when we're thinking
about the various programs that

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:53.719 align:middle line:84%
exist today to help men
reconnect with themselves--

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:55.705 align:middle line:84%
and oftentimes, they're
called rewylding.

00:34:55.705 --> 00:34:57.830 align:middle line:84%
You're not talking about
that rewylding because I'm

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:00.020 align:middle line:84%
talking about
programs well known,

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.990 align:middle line:84%
such as "Iron John" or
The ManKind Project,

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:08.540 align:middle line:84%
which is more kind of doubling
down on masculinity, which you

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:11.450 align:middle line:84%
can understand when things have
been so confused and dispersed

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:15.200 align:middle line:84%
and roles are so blurred
on so many levels now

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.720 align:middle line:84%
why people would want to get
back to something, as you say,

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:21.290 align:middle line:84%
that you can identify
and identify with.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:23.740 align:middle line:84%
But you're not
talking about that.

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: We're in a moment
of ecological collapse.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:28.400 align:middle line:90%
It's an emergency right now.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And I do worry that we
are not individuals.

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:35.210 align:middle line:84%
We are entangled
with webs of kinship

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:38.360 align:middle line:84%
that metabolically,
molecularly build us

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.610 align:middle line:90%
and that we are implicated in.

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And I worry sometimes
that these programs

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:47.810 align:middle line:84%
of rewylding masculinity
are overly focused

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:50.940 align:middle line:84%
on human narratives, and human
betterment, and progress--

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: --and that they're
not about actually becoming in

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:58.850 align:middle line:84%
relationship with the beings
that you live with and are

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:00.300 align:middle line:90%
in relationship with.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:04.850 align:middle line:84%
So for me, rewylding means
coming into relationship

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:09.350 align:middle line:84%
with the fungi, the plants,
the women, the queer people,

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:12.170 align:middle line:84%
the disabled people, the
Indigenous populations

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:15.200 align:middle line:84%
in your actual
locale and how can

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.840 align:middle line:84%
we literally root
masculinity back

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.920 align:middle line:84%
into place and into
a birthright of being

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:25.170 align:middle line:84%
a person who knows how to take
care of place and tend it.

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
what's interesting--

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:28.700 align:middle line:90%
I was listening to the fellow--

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:29.750 align:middle line:90%
I've forgotten his name--

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:33.230 align:middle line:84%
who started Ted Talks, and he
did a one on one with Elon Musk

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:34.100 align:middle line:90%
recently.

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking
about what happens with AI

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:40.580 align:middle line:90%
and robotization of industry.

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying
what it's doing is

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:46.970 align:middle line:84%
taking care of the repetitive
and dangerous jobs.

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And then he was
asked, yes, but what

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:50.540 align:middle line:90%
about taking jobs from humans?

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.580 align:middle line:84%
He said, what are
you talking about?

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:55.430 align:middle line:84%
We now have a labor
shortage going into--

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:58.800 align:middle line:84%
population collapse
was the word he used,

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.620 align:middle line:84%
which is interesting
because you're talking

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:02.360 align:middle line:90%
about ecological collapse.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And how can you disengage
one from the other?

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.280 align:middle line:90%
We're part of a natural system.

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And so then talking about
population collapses.

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:13.700 align:middle line:84%
We around the world, many,
many, many parts of the world

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.310 align:middle line:84%
do not have replacement
population now.

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:20.302 align:middle line:84%
So tell me how you
put that all together.

00:37:20.302 --> 00:37:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: How do I
put that all together?

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:23.940 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm not a galaxy mind.

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:24.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I'm
just saying when

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:28.430 align:middle line:84%
you look at those-- just
those two kind of bold,

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:30.860 align:middle line:84%
blunt statements, what's
the first thing that

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:34.850 align:middle line:84%
pops to mind because you're
clearly a very not just

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:37.590 align:middle line:90%
open but refined thinker.

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: I am always worried
that we think that evolution

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:44.160 align:middle line:84%
stops with us and that it's
not a constant updating,

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:48.480 align:middle line:84%
wild experimentation
and that we are--

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.960 align:middle line:84%
there was not one last
monkey, one final human.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.810 align:middle line:90%
Who put the stake in the river--

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:56.220 align:middle line:90%
I heard some writers say--

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and said, this was
the last monkey.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:37:59.100 align:middle line:90%
This was the first human.

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.350 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what we're
on the way to becoming.

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And when I say that, I
think a lot about symbiosis

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:09.720 align:middle line:84%
and how a very simplistic idea
of Darwinism is that species

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:13.230 align:middle line:84%
fork, and adapt, and
divide, and differentiate

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:15.570 align:middle line:84%
but that the most novelty
comes through moments

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:20.190 align:middle line:84%
when species fuse and when
they collaborate in very

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:22.570 align:middle line:90%
complicated, interesting ways.

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think right
now when I feel

00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:29.410 align:middle line:84%
panicked about what could
happen to human beings,

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:32.800 align:middle line:84%
I try and marry myself
to other species

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.200 align:middle line:84%
and say, all right,
if we don't make it,

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.770 align:middle line:84%
let's make sure other beings
make it so that it's not just

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:40.840 align:middle line:84%
about the hero's
journey of human beings,

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:45.160 align:middle line:84%
but it's about the wild
celebration of many beings

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.360 align:middle line:90%
trying to all make it together.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to marry mountains
and marry blighted chestnut

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:53.110 align:middle line:90%
trees.

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:55.273 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This brings
me to a subject

00:38:55.273 --> 00:38:57.565 align:middle line:84%
that you write about, which
is a new kind of courtship.

00:38:57.565 --> 00:38:58.195 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Yeah.

00:38:58.195 --> 00:38:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A new
kind of marriage.

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:01.690 align:middle line:84%
So go ahead and
continue on that thing.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: We've been so
deaf to our environments

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.210 align:middle line:84%
and to the beings
that have so much

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:09.250 align:middle line:90%
they want to share with us.

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:11.320 align:middle line:84%
They want to share with
us that they're harmed

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and that they're
hurting, but they also

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:20.180 align:middle line:84%
want to share wisdom, medicine,
stories, mirth, comfort.

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And you can't just
go into a forest

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:24.680 align:middle line:90%
and expect it to talk to you.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.700 align:middle line:90%
It's like a being.

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:26.630 align:middle line:90%
You need to court it.

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:27.470 align:middle line:90%
You need to woo it.

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:28.760 align:middle line:90%
You need to seduce it.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.260 align:middle line:84%
You need to begin
to play with it.

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And so that's-- I'm trying
to encourage people to enter

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:38.390 align:middle line:84%
into a more playful relationship
with animals, and with weeds,

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:42.260 align:middle line:84%
and trees, and mountains, and
weather systems, and say, OK,

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:44.090 align:middle line:84%
you might not speak
with me today,

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:47.600 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to try and get
creative and try and ask you

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.160 align:middle line:84%
some questions about what
you might actually want.

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:50.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:53.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I had a very similar
such experience recently

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:55.610 align:middle line:84%
breaking through
into communicating

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:57.440 align:middle line:84%
with another realm
that I kind of felt

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.860 align:middle line:84%
blocked to by getting creative
and doing what you're saying.

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:03.600 align:middle line:84%
The outcome was
very interesting.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:06.050 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
things when you say

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:08.570 align:middle line:84%
this-- when you say we have
to get used to the notion

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:12.890 align:middle line:84%
that maybe the ultimate of the
development of conscious beings

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:15.410 align:middle line:84%
on the planet isn't
human and we need

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:19.950 align:middle line:84%
to support the flowering of
other species, all of this

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:20.750 align:middle line:90%
is true.

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:23.570 align:middle line:84%
But I think people then
become frightened thinking

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:25.410 align:middle line:90%
we're not it.

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:28.160 align:middle line:84%
But what I want to say
is it doesn't matter.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.700 align:middle line:90%
Our consciousness continues.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Yes.

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:31.417 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We continue.

00:40:31.417 --> 00:40:32.780 align:middle line:90%
We can go to another place.

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:36.380 align:middle line:84%
We can take a human form again
somewhere else if that happens.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's not an advertisement
to allow what's happening

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.250 align:middle line:90%
to our ecosystems happen.

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:42.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying that.

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:45.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying not to go
into fear over the fact

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:49.650 align:middle line:84%
that one will cease to
exist if humans went by the

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:51.740 align:middle line:90%
by on this particular planet.

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.880 align:middle line:90%
Even that's not a disaster.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:56.150 align:middle line:84%
There are other places
to express oneself,

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:58.820 align:middle line:84%
other forms to
express oneself in.

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: That's very beautiful.

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I like to think
in terms of deep time.

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:07.070 align:middle line:84%
When we think about one
life, one short story,

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:12.230 align:middle line:84%
everything feels so
panicked, so urgent.

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:14.330 align:middle line:84%
But when we weave
ourselves into the fact

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:16.520 align:middle line:84%
that there have been
five major extinctions,

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:20.510 align:middle line:84%
that there have been extinction
events where 90% of the beings

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:22.610 align:middle line:90%
just were erased--

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:25.970 align:middle line:84%
and then, in fact, we are
the product of the space left

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:30.860 align:middle line:84%
behind by extinction events
but then the open space for new

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:35.120 align:middle line:84%
experimentations and
morphology and that we can't--

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.130 align:middle line:84%
when we weave ourselves
into that deep time,

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:41.720 align:middle line:90%
it's an embrace that is--

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.520 align:middle line:90%
it's geological.

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.600 align:middle line:90%
It's microbial.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.050 align:middle line:84%
It's not just one human
embracing another human.

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:49.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's what comforts me.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.210 align:middle line:84%
It's just seeing that there's
a story going on that's so much

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:54.995 align:middle line:90%
longer than my lifetime.

00:41:54.995 --> 00:41:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Playing the long game.

00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Yeah.

00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:58.145 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:58.145 --> 00:42:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I love
what you have to say.

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:04.137 align:middle line:84%
I love the fact that your mind
works in this diverse way.

00:42:04.137 --> 00:42:05.720 align:middle line:84%
When I was reading
the book, I thought

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.770 align:middle line:84%
it could be called
of mushrooms and men.

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:10.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:13.100 align:middle line:84%
But when-- you see
how your thinking is

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:16.580 align:middle line:84%
working on this about our
own organic blossoming

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:18.920 align:middle line:84%
and understanding of
self and you focusing

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:22.130 align:middle line:84%
on the masculine specifically
because your background really

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:24.510 align:middle line:84%
required that you come
to this in a new way.

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Yeah.

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:27.188 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're
almost out of time.

00:42:27.188 --> 00:42:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Are there any final
thoughts that you

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:31.370 align:middle line:84%
want to share with us
on this to take away?

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:34.070 align:middle line:10%
>>STRAND: Well, I
just want to say

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:37.010 align:middle line:10%
that when I wrote this
project, I was very, very ill

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:38.450 align:middle line:10%
and it was in the
middle of COVID.

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:41.000 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't think that
anyone would read it.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.090 align:middle line:10%
And I prayed to Dionysus.

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:46.250 align:middle line:10%
I said, I just want
to write about you.

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to offer up a
thanks to Dionysus and to--

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:51.350 align:middle line:90%
mostly, I want to thank--

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:54.230 align:middle line:84%
offer thanks to all
of the people who

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:56.810 align:middle line:84%
make me me, that I
want to complicate

00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:58.400 align:middle line:84%
the notion of an
individual author,

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:01.217 align:middle line:84%
that I'm here today because
of all of the support

00:43:01.217 --> 00:43:03.800 align:middle line:84%
I've received in this thinking,
people who've helped me think.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.383 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And, oddly,
even the trauma.

00:43:05.383 --> 00:43:06.370 align:middle line:90%
>>STRAND: Exactly.

00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:07.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.790 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sophie, thank you.

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:09.860 align:middle line:90%
You're a beautiful mind.

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>STRAND: Thank
you for having me.

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:13.370 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, the
name of Sophie's book

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:14.750 align:middle line:10%
is "The Flowering Wand."

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:16.700 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.830 align:middle line:10%
on "Open Minds."

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:22.180 align:middle line:90%
