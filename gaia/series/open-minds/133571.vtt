00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:29.650 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Every
living thing on our planet

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.590 align:middle line:10%
is dependent on it
for our nourishment,

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.810 align:middle line:10%
yet we've come to fear it's
presence and energetic output.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about the sun.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Nearly every
substantial ancient body

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.450 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual and
esoteric knowledge

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.930 align:middle line:84%
regards the sun as a
great teacher, even a god.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.540 align:middle line:84%
But as NASA keeps its
telescopes trained

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.700 align:middle line:84%
on the constant
activity, it's fast

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.190 align:middle line:84%
becoming an adversary
in the eyes of some,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.810 align:middle line:90%
if not to many people.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Here today, we're going to
talk about the sun's activity

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.000 align:middle line:84%
and how it's being
interpreted scientifically.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.900 align:middle line:90%
We're with Jack Cary.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.980 align:middle line:90%
And we're just starting there.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.230 align:middle line:90%
We've been talking off camera.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.010 align:middle line:90%
We could talk all day.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.830 align:middle line:84%
But let's start with
the sun, because it's

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.240 align:middle line:84%
so central to the themes of
the electromagnetic activity

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.170 align:middle line:84%
on the planet and our brains
and our own bodies and so forth

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and get into the
anomalous science

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.510 align:middle line:90%
that you're running into.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.760 align:middle line:90%
>>JACK CARY: Sure, absolutely.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.720 align:middle line:10%
Well, the sun-- and
I believe you're

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.630 align:middle line:10%
going to show the video--
recently had some very, very

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.570 align:middle line:10%
strange activity occur.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.270 align:middle line:10%
These orbs approached
our star, deposited

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.940 align:middle line:10%
what looked like very long
appendages into the sun

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.320 align:middle line:10%
and began to interact with it,
which is fascinating for us

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.320 align:middle line:10%
as a species that depends
upon it so totally.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It really shocking.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.020 align:middle line:90%
The visual images were shocking.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.200 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like sticking
a straw in and sucking

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.700 align:middle line:90%
energy out of the sun.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.090 align:middle line:84%
But this orb is
massive in size, when

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.430 align:middle line:84%
you think that, what is
it, a million Earths could

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.590 align:middle line:90%
fit inside the size of the sun.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.540 align:middle line:84%
How large must that
thing have been?

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.470 align:middle line:10%
>>CARY: Oh, it was
on a scale that

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.010 align:middle line:10%
humans-- we have a hard
time even contemplating.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.790 align:middle line:84%
The type of technology it would
require to produce something

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.870 align:middle line:84%
like that that can interact with
a star on that kind of a level

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.250 align:middle line:84%
is beyond anything that
most of us can imagine.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating is
right before this occurrence

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.560 align:middle line:84%
happened recently
and in 2012, right

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.090 align:middle line:84%
at the time of the Mayan
prophecy of there being

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.310 align:middle line:84%
an end to this current
society, you also

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.420 align:middle line:84%
had one of these orbs show
up, interact with the sun.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.660 align:middle line:84%
This was all occurring at a time
when you could literally get on

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.560 align:middle line:84%
to spaceweather.com and
watch these huge X flares

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.190 align:middle line:84%
beginning to form and cause
a real concern for life

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.720 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you
have these orbs show up.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.430 align:middle line:84%
They put these appendages
down into the sun,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.490 align:middle line:84%
they interact with our
star, they shoot off

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.170 align:middle line:84%
into space at such a velocity
that it left us just awestruck.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.029 align:middle line:84%
And then the sun goes completely
quiet, as quiet as a church

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:20.070 align:middle line:90%
mouse after all of this--

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
because it almost seems

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.960 align:middle line:90%
like it's siphoning off energy.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you think
about-- I mean like you said,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.120 align:middle line:84%
the technology would be
incomprehensible to us

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.400 align:middle line:84%
when you think about just the
sheer temperatures of the sun,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.870 align:middle line:84%
surface-- I mean internal
temperatures are just

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.614 align:middle line:90%
27 million degrees Fahrenheit.

00:03:40.614 --> 00:03:42.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like we can't
fathom this stuff.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Can't even fathom that.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And having the technological,
scientific know-how

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.060 align:middle line:84%
of what to do to a star
in order to make it

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.040 align:middle line:84%
not a threat to a
neighboring planet

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:84%
is indicative of interaction
with the Type 2 civilization.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And before we go
further, explain-- you're

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.510 align:middle line:90%
talking Michio Kaku's work.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.525 align:middle line:84%
Explain what a Type 2
civilization is to people.

00:04:08.525 --> 00:04:09.325 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:04:09.325 --> 00:04:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are
various physicists

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.830 align:middle line:84%
around the world who have
classified what they believe

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.829 align:middle line:84%
different space-faring
civilizations would

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.910 align:middle line:90%
be capable of doing.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.430 align:middle line:84%
A Type 2 civilization
is an alien civilization

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.260 align:middle line:84%
that's literally learned how
to harness the power of a star

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.660 align:middle line:84%
to alter it, to use it
to their ends and means.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And the type of
technology required

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.780 align:middle line:84%
to do something like that is
so beyond anything, thousands

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.150 align:middle line:84%
of years beyond our
capability here on Earth.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And you look at where
we've come in 100

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.660 align:middle line:84%
years from horse-drawn
covered wagons

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.690 align:middle line:84%
to going to various
stellar bodies

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.140 align:middle line:84%
within our planetary
system, in 100 years you

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.640 align:middle line:84%
are a truly amazing
species to be

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.950 align:middle line:90%
able to do something like that.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And even that
you would say, well,

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.660 align:middle line:84%
we've got to be 10,000
years from being

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.200 align:middle line:84%
able to do something like that,
even at that kind of pace.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I mean,
it is mind-boggling,

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.540 align:middle line:84%
but it's kind of
fun to contemplate.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, the
telescopes that are picking up

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.200 align:middle line:84%
this activity, are
they looking in

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.480 align:middle line:84%
a normal spectrum, far
infrared, ultraviolet-- what

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.400 align:middle line:90%
spectrum are they seeing into?

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah, well, they have
actual what are called SOHO

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:84%
telescopes run by NASA that
measure all kinds of different

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.040 align:middle line:84%
frequencies on the sun and
electromagnetic activity

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.545 align:middle line:84%
and can see in different
spectrums of light and--

00:05:41.545 --> 00:05:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I'm wondering, is

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.190 align:middle line:84%
what spectrum of light was
that showing itself in?

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: That was full spectrum.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:48.730 align:middle line:90%
That was just there--

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so now that's
what leads to the next question.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So if we can see it
with our technology,

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.560 align:middle line:84%
this is not like it's a
higher dimension-- it may have

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.160 align:middle line:90%
another aspect of it that is.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.100 align:middle line:84%
It's in these
dimensional fields.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.680 align:middle line:84%
So it has to play with the laws
however they might actually

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.480 align:middle line:90%
exist.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.820 align:middle line:90%
We don't really understand them.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.274 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Right, within
this particular dimension.

00:06:10.274 --> 00:06:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This
dimension, exactly.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And, yeah, these
things, whatever this Type 2

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.230 align:middle line:84%
civilization is, it
is clearly interacting

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.540 align:middle line:90%
on a biological level.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.248 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to say.

00:06:21.248 --> 00:06:22.490 align:middle line:90%
It has to be organic.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.900 align:middle line:84%
This is not technology
as we understand it.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Now, you may be
looking at a civilization that

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.910 align:middle line:84%
does have those capabilities,
that is able to go

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.540 align:middle line:90%
into another dimension.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's plenty of physicists
even today around the world

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.980 align:middle line:84%
who are saying, yes,
these extra dimensions

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.890 align:middle line:84%
do exist, that if they
exist, there are, in fact,

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.350 align:middle line:90%
other creatures living on them.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And if there are, then
it's likely some of them

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.110 align:middle line:84%
are so advanced that
they have figured out

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.457 align:middle line:90%
a way into this dimension.

00:06:54.457 --> 00:06:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're going to
get into a lot of that talk

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:90%
in a little bit, too.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.700 align:middle line:84%
But this apparently
looks like a civilization

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.410 align:middle line:84%
that has developed here in
our space-time continuum

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.710 align:middle line:84%
within not too
far of a distance.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like elements
of that civilization

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.710 align:middle line:84%
are now interacting
with this planet.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So from other accounts
of these type of extremely

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.100 align:middle line:84%
advanced orbs and
such, it appears

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.890 align:middle line:84%
that, as you mentioned
earlier, that these

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.990 align:middle line:84%
seem to tend to be
organic and interface

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:33.190 align:middle line:84%
with consciousness directly,
are conscious themselves, even.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:33.992 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:07:33.992 --> 00:07:35.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
I'm just looking--

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm just trying to
figure this thing out

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.550 align:middle line:84%
on a third/fourth-dimensional
level that we're in here.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.510 align:middle line:84%
How can that-- even
the surface of the sun

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:84%
is still another, what,
10,000 degrees or something,

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.980 align:middle line:84%
the coolest part of it, just
the part we start receiving.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And so what do you
do with that, right?

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah, I
mean, what are you

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:59.622 align:middle line:90%
going to do to have any say-so?

00:07:59.622 --> 00:08:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How arrogant
to think we would.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Right,
with a civilization

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.940 align:middle line:90%
that has those capabilities.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's fascinating to
me is that in a huge body

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.230 align:middle line:84%
of ancient lore running through
civilization after civilization

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.020 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, you
have clearly what

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.310 align:middle line:84%
is depicted as being an
interaction between humanity

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.350 align:middle line:84%
and an alien species
of some kind.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's fascinating is that
at some point in that lore,

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:34.289 align:middle line:84%
you begin to pick up elements of
these things hiding themselves.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:36.590 align:middle line:90%
They go into concealment.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.400 align:middle line:90%
And why is that?

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Why did they decide to conceal
their presence from the species

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.830 align:middle line:84%
that they are now
interacting with?

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.160 align:middle line:90%
And what does that mean?

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:52.110 align:middle line:84%
What does that tell us about
our place in that civilization

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.360 align:middle line:90%
and their plans for us?

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.080 align:middle line:84%
That's where we really need to
begin to focus our attention.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.440 align:middle line:90%


00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Was that a point where a
non-benevolent leadership

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.920 align:middle line:84%
in the civilization
became a benevolent one

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.040 align:middle line:84%
and they decided, well, we're
going to make this planet

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.720 align:middle line:84%
a special experiment or
we're going to make it

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.210 align:middle line:84%
a nature preserve
but we're going

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.784 align:middle line:90%
to leave the species alone?

00:09:19.784 --> 00:09:21.200 align:middle line:84%
We'll do what we
can to help them.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It seems to me
that's been a clear directive.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And do we need to be concerned
with a time in the future

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.550 align:middle line:90%
when that policy changes?

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.950 align:middle line:90%
That's my concern.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
and thus far, we've

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.790 align:middle line:84%
been more or less--
I mean, yes, there

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.140 align:middle line:84%
are 1,000 different
theories on this,

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:47.800 align:middle line:84%
as to whether through
genetic manipulation

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:84%
or direct manipulation
of some kind

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:54.100 align:middle line:84%
other species have inserted
their genetic influence

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.190 align:middle line:90%
and whatnot into us.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.060 align:middle line:84%
It's from the beginning, so
it's almost a moot point now.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.184 align:middle line:84%
Once they start figuring
out what junk DNA is,

00:10:00.184 --> 00:10:02.350 align:middle line:84%
they'll find out there's
not a lot of junk in there,

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.400 align:middle line:84%
but there's a lot of
interesting stuff, right?

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.358 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right, exactly.

00:10:05.358 --> 00:10:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're a hybrid
species to begin with.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I think the
concern doesn't-- I'm not that

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:14.440 align:middle line:84%
concerned about it for
the simple reason that

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.470 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at a species that
is a hybrid species that also

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:21.220 align:middle line:84%
has a completely separate
non-physical aspect that

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:22.630 align:middle line:90%
transcends it.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.160 align:middle line:84%
So if something happens
to the physical structures

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.250 align:middle line:84%
of these DNA masses, you
move on down the road.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:33.010 align:middle line:84%
So to me, you just
merge with another type

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.290 align:middle line:84%
of physical substance
if that's the choice.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And were so wrapped
around the axle

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.240 align:middle line:84%
that something is going to be
altered in the human species--

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.229 align:middle line:90%
it's already altered.

00:10:41.229 --> 00:10:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Wait till we start talking
about this other stuff

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.150 align:middle line:90%
in a little bit, right?

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.720 align:middle line:84%
So how do you blend that
thought with all of this?

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Does it take some
of the fear out?

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: It does on some
level, because clearly we're

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.130 align:middle line:84%
of importance to
this civilization.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.046 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we are.

00:10:56.046 --> 00:10:57.410 align:middle line:90%
This planet is of importance.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Why they
choose to conceal

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:03.700 align:middle line:84%
themselves is an endlessly
fascinating topic to me.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.600 align:middle line:84%
We've got scientists using new
types of telescopes that are

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.010 align:middle line:84%
telling us that through
the use of these telescopes

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.700 align:middle line:84%
they're detecting craft that
cannot be seen in our light

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:14.830 align:middle line:90%
spectrum.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:18.740 align:middle line:84%
That's fascinating and that it
appears as though they're using

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.670 align:middle line:84%
anti-matter as a type of
propulsion and that through

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.550 align:middle line:84%
the exhaust of some
of these particles,

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.330 align:middle line:84%
they're able to achieve an
invisibility within our--

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like a cloaking.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: A cloaking.

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:34.060 align:middle line:84%
That is a civilization who
has gone to extreme lengths

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.760 align:middle line:90%
to hide their presence.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It might be
they are observers, too.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:38.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: It could be.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It could
be they simply

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.853 align:middle line:90%
cruise around, take notes.

00:11:40.853 --> 00:11:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: It could be.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It could be something
as benign as like when we're

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.150 align:middle line:84%
watching another species
or even other people

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:48.380 align:middle line:90%
through one-way mirror.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned
before how far we've

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.260 align:middle line:90%
come as a species in 100 years.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe that's was
the point and that's

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.750 align:middle line:90%
what they're looking at.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And how can they
take that technique

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.480 align:middle line:84%
and apply it to other
planetary bodies?

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.400 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not like
human beings aren't known

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.470 align:middle line:90%
for our own secretive ways.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:09.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right Exactly.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so just because
something cloaks or obscures

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.846 align:middle line:84%
itself doesn't necessarily
mean it's evil.

00:12:14.846 --> 00:12:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: No, no, not at all.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.886 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It just means
it doesn't necessarily

00:12:17.886 --> 00:12:21.360 align:middle line:84%
want to interface in a conscious
fashion with whoever's here.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And what's also
fascinating to me

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.450 align:middle line:84%
is that we're
beginning to notice it.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:26.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Our technology is catching
up to where they are.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Right, like
the rats who eventually

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.490 align:middle line:84%
see the bars of the cage
they're residing in.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:37.870 align:middle line:84%
We're beginning to see the
bars of our reality construct.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.469 align:middle line:84%
And that's got to
be something that's

00:12:39.469 --> 00:12:40.510 align:middle line:90%
very interesting to them.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
fascinating, yeah.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Oh, gosh, OK, so regarding
the telescopes, OK,

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.950 align:middle line:84%
so we have a whole other
conversation we want to go to,

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.990 align:middle line:84%
but what else do we need
to know about the sun

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.830 align:middle line:90%
and its activities.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Because it was very disturbing
a few years ago when

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Ed Dames and others-- and
I interviewed him on this--

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:03.410 align:middle line:84%
came out and were talking about
the killshot from the sun.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's always been
a disconnect for me.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.060 align:middle line:90%
This is life-giving force.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Why would it want to kill
everything in the solar system?

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:13.510 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.710 align:middle line:84%
No, it's only dangerous
to us because we've

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:20.560 align:middle line:84%
become so dependent upon
electronics system that

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.440 align:middle line:90%
hasn't protected from the star.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.540 align:middle line:84%
If it were all grounded, well,
we just wouldn't worry at all.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.804 align:middle line:84%
But we're worried about
the gas pumps stopping.

00:13:28.804 --> 00:13:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
electronics systems.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.065 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And the food
trucks not rolling anymore

00:13:33.065 --> 00:13:35.240 align:middle line:84%
and the entire
internet going down.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And all of that could
be prevented if they had

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:39.874 align:middle line:90%
spent the right kind of money.

00:13:39.874 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, it
could have been.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:42.414 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: And still could be.

00:13:42.414 --> 00:13:44.920 align:middle line:84%
There was a bill in
Congress a few years ago

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:50.260 align:middle line:84%
in order to protect the power
grid by grounding it properly.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And it got shot down, of
course, in Washington,

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.940 align:middle line:90%
as things will get shot down.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And so we're still
vulnerable on that level,

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:01.930 align:middle line:84%
that 1885 Carrington
Event level.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.430 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's fascinating.

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that wiped
out what percentage

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.430 align:middle line:90%
of the population at the time?

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Well, at that
time, barely anyone,

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.327 align:middle line:90%
because there wasn't--

00:14:08.327 --> 00:14:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, just
a few thousand people.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: There wasn't any
sort of electrical system

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.870 align:middle line:90%
grid built around the planet.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.660 align:middle line:84%
The most they had were
telegraph machines,

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.730 align:middle line:84%
and these were running to
various railroad offices.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, those offices
reported sparks

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:26.320 align:middle line:84%
flying out of the machinery
and things catching on fire.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And it killed a couple of the
operators of the telegraph

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.240 align:middle line:90%
machine.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.698 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we
weren't wired yet.

00:14:31.698 --> 00:14:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: But we weren't
wired like we are now.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so they
talk about the killshot

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:43.100 align:middle line:84%
as leading to an extreme loss
of life around this planet.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as you say, we've
done nothing to blunt that.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.080 align:middle line:84%
We've done nothing
proactive along that line.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And you have to look
at it philosophically.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.400 align:middle line:84%
How much of an advantage
on a humanistic level

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.170 align:middle line:84%
is it to us right
now that we've become

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:03.040 align:middle line:84%
that dependent on that one
particular source of energy?

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Exactly.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
electronics in general.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah,
electronics in general.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
concerning it is

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:14.020 align:middle line:84%
that at about the same time that
the Dames group was coming out

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.780 align:middle line:84%
with their killshot
prediction, we clearly

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.390 align:middle line:84%
picked up elements
of our government

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.360 align:middle line:84%
who were paying
attention to that

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.510 align:middle line:84%
and who had begun to prepare for
that exact event taking place.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about the
Department of Homeland Security

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:31.440 align:middle line:84%
purchasing billions of
rounds of ammunition

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.650 align:middle line:90%
at that exact point in time.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the increase
in underground bases.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:35.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.450 align:middle line:84%
These were people that
were paying attention

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:41.260 align:middle line:84%
to what their CIA-trained
remote viewers were telling them

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.800 align:middle line:84%
and were beginning to
prepare clandestinely

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.910 align:middle line:90%
for that exact event to occur.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.522 align:middle line:84%
And that's when these
orbs showed up--

00:15:47.522 --> 00:15:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, I
was just going to say.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And began to
interact with the star.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:53.200 align:middle line:90%
And it was clear.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Web Bot,
Cliff High's Web Bot

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:57.930 align:middle line:84%
at this exact
moment in time also

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:00.520 align:middle line:84%
detected something
very, very strange.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.512 align:middle line:84%
And he equated it with what
must have been a time traveler.

00:16:04.512 --> 00:16:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Explain this.

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah, being
interjected into this system.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you're saying--
at this time right now?

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Right, at that
same moment in time.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At that
moment in time?

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.026 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And this
was back in 2012.

00:16:15.026 --> 00:16:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 2012, right.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:16.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: They also detected
something very strange

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.040 align:middle line:90%
occurring.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Because the Web Bot was
also predicting what

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:25.120 align:middle line:84%
was being called the
Global Coastal Event.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.710 align:middle line:84%
This was going to
be an event that

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:28.920 align:middle line:84%
wiped out the coastlines
around the world.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Didn't happen.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Didn't happen.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:36.210 align:middle line:84%
So you had the Mayan prophecy,
the Web Bot, the Dames group,

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.380 align:middle line:84%
the Department of
Homeland Security all

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.470 align:middle line:84%
pointing in the same
direction at the time you had

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.620 align:middle line:84%
these orbs show up,
interact with our star,

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.842 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
that all just goes away.

00:16:47.842 --> 00:16:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now isn't
that kind of reassuring?

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: It is,
because clearly we're

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.540 align:middle line:84%
dealing with a
benevolence of some kind.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And these are creatures
who understood

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:00.570 align:middle line:90%
the peril we were in and came.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And now our timeline
has been altered.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And where we go from
here, we don't know.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:10.900 align:middle line:84%
Because we were preparing
for a reset of human society

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.300 align:middle line:90%
completely.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.349 align:middle line:84%
And it probably would
have began again

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:16.980 align:middle line:84%
with the Amish in North
America, because these

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.550 align:middle line:84%
are a people who
have already learned

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:23.430 align:middle line:84%
to live without electricity,
who grew all their own food, who

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:27.550 align:middle line:84%
produce their own livestock,
build their own furniture, who

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:33.280 align:middle line:84%
are completely independent of
a system that is so at peril

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.670 align:middle line:90%
from our star.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's
interesting about that, too,

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.120 align:middle line:84%
is that when people
are viewing--

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.550 align:middle line:84%
and this is what
I've noticed-- there

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:51.070 align:middle line:90%
are often multiple potentials.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.350 align:middle line:84%
So they're viewing
into one potential.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: That's right.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:02.065 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the whole thing
about prediction is flawed.

00:18:02.065 --> 00:18:02.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: That's right.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:07.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, they've shown through
the Schrodinger cat experiments

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.400 align:middle line:84%
that observation
changes the outcome.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: I made that argument
on the Paranormal Intelligence

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Agency website that
it could be that

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:18.780 align:middle line:84%
because these remote viewers
are seeing these events,

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:23.460 align:middle line:84%
they are literally altering
the outcome of those events.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
could very well be.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I just wanted
to bring that up

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:30.480 align:middle line:84%
because often times
predictions usually

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.840 align:middle line:84%
don't turn out to--
they don't turn out.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.600 align:middle line:84%
For the most part,
very few predictions

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.526 align:middle line:84%
we've heard, certainly
in the conspiracy

00:18:36.526 --> 00:18:38.650 align:middle line:84%
community across the board,
because I've been aware

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:42.420 align:middle line:84%
of almost all of them, none of
them have happened, actually.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:45.550 align:middle line:84%
So you have to look at, is
it our desire, observation?

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Is it a benevolent
species beyond us

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.326 align:middle line:84%
that are assisting because
it's in nobody's best interest

00:18:52.326 --> 00:18:53.700 align:middle line:84%
to see this-- if
you want to call

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.680 align:middle line:84%
it a terrarium or
an experiment--

00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:02.320 align:middle line:84%
go down when we're a really
unique species among species?

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.970 align:middle line:84%
I've never gotten when I've
looked that this place is

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle line:90%
in extreme peril.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.550 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
it's not challenged,

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:12.307 align:middle line:90%
but not extreme peril.

00:19:12.307 --> 00:19:14.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And that's what
we're picking up, is

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:19.050 align:middle line:84%
that it appears as though
there are other beings who

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:22.770 align:middle line:84%
are interested in our
survival and continuation

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:26.440 align:middle line:84%
and are actively
pursuing those ends.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And we're beginning to see that
in a number of different areas

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.620 align:middle line:84%
that we would describe
as being paranormal.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.020 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's fascinating.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.030 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's all juicy.

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right, right.

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:43.260 align:middle line:84%
So we have what ufologists
call the cattle mutilation

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.110 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon.

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And you have people like
Johnny Mac and the man

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.800 align:middle line:84%
who wrote "The
Threat," Dr. David M.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.380 align:middle line:84%
Jacobs from Temple
University, who at one time

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:59.670 align:middle line:84%
taught the only accredited UFO
course in the entire United

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:00.470 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:04.190 align:middle line:84%
He's worked 40 years
with alien abductees.

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And in so doing, he
came across a number

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.940 align:middle line:84%
of patterns between abductees
that couldn't have been there

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:16.900 align:middle line:84%
unless there was some sort of
basis to what they were saying.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So they were all having
a similar experience,

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:24.300 align:middle line:84%
but we don't where that
experience took place.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.880 align:middle line:84%
For example, I interviewed
Ken Cherry recently.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.780 align:middle line:90%
You know that work.

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.300 align:middle line:84%
So he's saying a lot of
the stuff was terrestrial.

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.770 align:middle line:84%
You have inner
earth alien species.

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:35.929 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily happening
on a spaceship somewhere.

00:20:35.929 --> 00:20:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Could be what we call
ultra-terrestrial beings.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.678 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA:
Ultra-terrestrial, right.

00:20:39.678 --> 00:20:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And it could be collaborations
between the spirit

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:44.280 align:middle line:90%
that people are unconscious.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.980 align:middle line:84%
It can be possibly
against their will.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.360 align:middle line:90%
We really don't know.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.110 align:middle line:84%
It could run in genetics strains
where a particular tribe has

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:54.870 align:middle line:84%
an agreement with another
species to allow themselves

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:55.830 align:middle line:90%
to be worked with.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:56.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Exactly.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is in
a lot of long-term abductee

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:04.120 align:middle line:84%
cases, the person initially
has a very bad opinion

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:04.920 align:middle line:90%
and experience.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.268 align:middle line:90%
Because they're scared.

00:21:06.268 --> 00:21:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And slowly
that fear goes away,

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:11.640 align:middle line:84%
and they come into this whole
of their understanding of what's

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.700 align:middle line:90%
taking place.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Expanded awareness.

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And that whatever this
is, this species truly

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.790 align:middle line:84%
thinks it's important
for our evolution,

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:27.180 align:middle line:84%
or they wouldn't have
gone to such great lengths

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.650 align:middle line:90%
in order to do it.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, now this takes us into
another really interesting area

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:37.000 align:middle line:84%
that we were talking
about earlier

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.962 align:middle line:84%
and the notion of these
power spots on the planet.

00:21:43.962 --> 00:21:45.420 align:middle line:84%
Because I can't
help but think some

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.640 align:middle line:84%
of these bases,
underground bases,

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.900 align:middle line:84%
are also aligned with
these spots, too.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.235 align:middle line:90%
Sedona is a famous one.

00:21:53.235 --> 00:21:58.540 align:middle line:84%
One man in the
intelligence community

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:02.610 align:middle line:84%
said that in and around a
30-mile radius of Sedona

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.130 align:middle line:84%
are something like six or
eight underground bases.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And you go out in
Boynton Canyon,

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:10.260 align:middle line:84%
and you have cables that thick
coming out of red rocks out

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:11.420 align:middle line:90%
in the wilderness.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:12.540 align:middle line:90%
What's up?

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's just assume
that ET civilizations

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and human civilizations,
military industrial,

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.380 align:middle line:90%
are going to these power spots.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that and what
it takes to create these spots

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:27.390 align:middle line:90%
and what's going on there.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.139 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah, it's
fascinating you mention

00:22:29.139 --> 00:22:32.760 align:middle line:84%
that, because in a number
of areas around the world,

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:36.540 align:middle line:84%
you have a vast array
of paranormal activity

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.380 align:middle line:84%
all occurring within a
very small geographic area.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, these have been
traditionally referred

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.550 align:middle line:90%
to as vortex areas.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And what you find in
these areas like Sedona,

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:51.900 align:middle line:84%
like the San Luis Valley
of South Central Colorado,

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.990 align:middle line:84%
is electromagnetic
fields that are

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:57.930 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of times more
powerful than the surrounding

00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:59.700 align:middle line:90%
topography.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:03.720 align:middle line:84%
These are places where
indigenous peoples have always

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.280 align:middle line:84%
held sacred, have witnessed
nonstop paranormal activity

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.640 align:middle line:84%
taking place, what we would
describe as paranormal activity

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.450 align:middle line:84%
taking place, all kinds
of strange activity.

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:19.890 align:middle line:84%
These are places that somebody
in the industrial-military

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:23.100 align:middle line:84%
complex has also now
focused on, and they

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.700 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to not only
buy up land in these areas,

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.800 align:middle line:84%
but place a military
presence there.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.620 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as though they
know the doorways are there,

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:35.640 align:middle line:84%
and they're beginning to place
guards at those doorways.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:37.260 align:middle line:90%
Continue.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.301 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to bring one up
and see what you think.

00:23:39.301 --> 00:23:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah,
well, one such case

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.020 align:middle line:84%
would be the
so-called Skinwalker

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:51.160 align:middle line:84%
Ranch that was investigated by
Robert Bigelow's now completely

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:51.960 align:middle line:90%
private group.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.610 align:middle line:84%
They used to publish
their information,

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:56.090 align:middle line:84%
but the National Institute
for Discovery Science

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:59.139 align:middle line:84%
were the ones who actually
purchased the Sherman ranch,

00:23:59.139 --> 00:24:00.430 align:middle line:90%
which became Skin Walker Ranch.

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so tell
people about this.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: So Robert Bigelow is
a billionaire from Las Vegas.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:10.260 align:middle line:84%
He also owns Bigelow Aerospace,
which is fascinating.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:14.760 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the only people
has his own space station

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.990 align:middle line:90%
in orbit around the planet.

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.770 align:middle line:90%
So that's fascinating.

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:19.020 align:middle line:90%
He has curiosity, too.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And when he was young, he had
some paranormal experiences

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.320 align:middle line:84%
and told himself, hey, when
I have the means and ways,

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to form a group to
begin to study some of this.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, this became known
as the National Institute

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.670 align:middle line:90%
for Discovery Science.

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first
operations they did

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.230 align:middle line:84%
was the so-called
"Skinwalker Ranch,"

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:41.550 align:middle line:84%
which is now a famous book
written by Colm Kelliher, PhD,

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:46.110 align:middle line:84%
and George Knapp, who
broke the Area 51 story.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And what ended up happening
was Robert Bigelow went around,

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and he found some of the
world's best scientists,

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and he paid them
a really nice fee

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.930 align:middle line:84%
to go to this ranch
that was experiencing

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:01.200 align:middle line:84%
paranormal activity on
a wide-ranging basis.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking about
orbs and UFOs and what

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:09.030 align:middle line:84%
appears to be interdimensional
activity, ghost activity,

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:10.590 align:middle line:90%
unexplained animal deaths.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.850 align:middle line:90%
They ran the gamut.

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And so he got these world-class
scientists to go to this ranch,

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:19.690 align:middle line:84%
and they stayed there for
eight years on this ranch

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:21.706 align:middle line:90%
studying this phenomenon.

00:25:21.706 --> 00:25:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And the best they
could determine

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:26.950 align:middle line:84%
was that they were interacting
with a non-human intelligence

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:31.270 align:middle line:84%
that was somehow residing within
the topography of that land.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And it could be
that this is also

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:35.930 align:middle line:84%
happening in other
areas around the world.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:38.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we're
pretty sure it is.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And you have different
areas, usually

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:48.220 align:middle line:84%
in desolate places, where they
were once privately owned ranch

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.690 align:middle line:90%
lands most of the time.

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:53.020 align:middle line:84%
The military is quietly
buying up these areas

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:56.470 align:middle line:84%
and quietly placing
a presence there.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And their scientists
have to be studying this.

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:03.360 align:middle line:84%
There is no way they did not
notice Robert Bigelow's group.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Nor would they
dismiss their findings

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:11.380 align:middle line:84%
because of the academic
credentials of the people who

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.490 align:middle line:90%
were involved.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:14.440 align:middle line:84%
So I believe it
was at that stage

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.950 align:middle line:84%
that they really begin to
take an active role in finding

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.695 align:middle line:84%
these areas and
beginning to study them

00:26:20.695 --> 00:26:21.820 align:middle line:90%
without the public knowing.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are the
common traits or constituents

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:27.590 align:middle line:84%
of the soil, earth
in those areas?

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: One is very large
quartz or limestone deposits.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.515 align:middle line:90%
Two is you'll have a--

00:26:33.515 --> 00:26:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So granite?

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:35.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And you'll also have
a very old, usually

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.410 align:middle line:84%
in North America, a
Native American not only

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:43.450 align:middle line:84%
presence there, but it's
places that they would

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:46.120 align:middle line:90%
consider to be sacred land.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Because of their interaction
with these areas over so many

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:50.880 align:middle line:90%
generations, they've learned--

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
you can see them.

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.750 align:middle line:84%
When you're there, if
you close your eyes,

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:55.450 align:middle line:84%
you can see the
elders still there.

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And they've learned to
venerate these areas.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And so you can
always zero in on these areas

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.010 align:middle line:90%
through that.

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:06.220 align:middle line:10%
Now you can begin to
pick up military elements

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.180 align:middle line:10%
in each one of these areas.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.390 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these
areas, you'll find

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:13.450 align:middle line:84%
black, unmarked
military-style helicopters,

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:16.060 align:middle line:90%
nonstop activity going on.

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:18.120 align:middle line:90%
They're measuring something.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.870 align:middle line:90%
They're studying something.

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.900 align:middle line:84%
They're concerned about
something at these areas,

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.350 align:middle line:84%
or they wouldn't be doing
it so clandestinely.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's also something
that I've picked up

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:33.190 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of occult
lore, is this idea

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:38.340 align:middle line:84%
that these doorways could
be dangerous on some level.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, the ancient,
ancient city of Ur, right?

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yes.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
US goes in, does

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:51.790 align:middle line:84%
what we're going to do when
we essentially invade Iraq.

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:55.030 align:middle line:84%
One of the first things they did
was sequester the city of Ur.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: And go to the ziggurat.

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yep.

00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:59.590 align:middle line:90%
And nobody talks about that.

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:01.312 align:middle line:90%
Then they built an embassy.

00:28:01.312 --> 00:28:02.770 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the
largest US embassy

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:06.850 align:middle line:84%
in the world surrounding it
so no one has access to it

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:09.160 align:middle line:90%
but whoever they allow in there.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's considered
to be one of the most

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:14.820 align:middle line:84%
potent of those places, in
the parlance of our field,

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:15.700 align:middle line:90%
stargate of sorts.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yes, yes.

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, you also have
what apparently

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:26.560 align:middle line:84%
was a group of elite bloodlines
who trace their blood

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:32.200 align:middle line:84%
lineage back to the very
first known man-god,

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.534 align:middle line:90%
and his name was Ya.

00:28:33.534 --> 00:28:35.200 align:middle line:84%
That's where the word
Yahweh comes from.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is through
Babylonian bloodlines.

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:40.600 align:middle line:84%
And I believe
personally that they

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.180 align:middle line:84%
were going back to
retrieve what they

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.310 align:middle line:90%
saw as being family relics.

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:47.860 align:middle line:90%


00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:51.250 align:middle line:84%
These are a group of people
who not only derive their right

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:55.060 align:middle line:84%
to rule on this planet
from this blood lineage,

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.580 align:middle line:84%
but they also believe that
they own all of-- that

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:01.180 align:middle line:84%
those relics not only
show their right to rule,

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.610 align:middle line:84%
but they have a right
to those relics.

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
where they all went.

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:08.140 align:middle line:84%
I think they went
into these bloodlines,

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:10.570 align:middle line:84%
and they're being
privately held now.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:13.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so the city of Ur
is just one example and a very

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:17.170 align:middle line:84%
elaborate structure to protect,
where the rest are usually

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:19.180 align:middle line:90%
virtually invisible or unknown.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.670 align:middle line:84%
It just looks like
nature for the most part,

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:25.510 align:middle line:84%
unless you see a couple of
SUVs or a power box somewhere.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Exactly, exactly.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And it could even be that they
had something telling them

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:35.290 align:middle line:84%
where to find a particular
item at that ziggurat,

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:38.890 align:middle line:84%
that it was still there,
still hidden, still buried,

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and that they could
go and retrieve it.

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Would justify the expense
that they went to to get it.

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now, you
look at the other level

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.280 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
interfacing with that.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.690 align:middle line:90%
These people feel entitled.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:54.470 align:middle line:84%
They feel connected, for
whatever their reasons are.

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:59.470 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, you have
those who are so uninformed,

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:02.530 align:middle line:84%
soldiers that went in and just
started defacing the place

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:04.450 align:middle line:90%
and creating graffiti.

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:07.750 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, which is worse?

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:09.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are
two extreme levels

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:12.400 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness interfacing
with obviously a very

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.550 align:middle line:90%
sacred area on the planet.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:19.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Right, and both with
completely different motives.

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:23.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, ignorance
isn't always bliss.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:23.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:26.200 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.454 align:middle line:84%
And it's fascinating
to me that they

00:30:29.454 --> 00:30:31.120 align:middle line:84%
derive their right
to rule through that,

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.980 align:middle line:84%
because all of our species
has been altered now.

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they're
any different than any

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:37.430 align:middle line:90%
of the rest of us.

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:39.430 align:middle line:90%
It's all been altered.

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:45.650 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you were talking
about these areas that

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:47.350 align:middle line:90%
have extreme quartz in them.

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is just a personal
experience that happened,

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.680 align:middle line:84%
and it just occurred to
me it happened in Sedona.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.770 align:middle line:90%
One time was in Sedona.

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:57.450 align:middle line:84%
The other time was in an area
with high amounts of granite--

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:59.410 align:middle line:90%
very high amounts of granite.

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was a simple phenomena,
but it was powerful.

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And one of them, my
cousin was with me,

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:07.540 align:middle line:90%
and we both were, really?

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And there are
massive green balls

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:13.600 align:middle line:84%
of light coming from above
and then slamming down

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.940 align:middle line:90%
into the earth.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And both times, again,
these are both areas

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:21.630 align:middle line:84%
that have had
indigenous populations.

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:24.069 align:middle line:84%
They're both areas with
very high mineral content

00:31:24.069 --> 00:31:25.110 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And we had mentioned the
San Luis Valley earlier.

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:30.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:31.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh, let's talk about that.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.380 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:34.213 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Which is
fascinating, because here's

00:31:34.213 --> 00:31:38.950 align:middle line:84%
an area that has just a nonstop
display of paranormal activity

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:39.750 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:41.280 align:middle line:84%
One day we'll get
a witness that's

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.510 align:middle line:84%
had a Sasquatch
encounter, the next day

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:45.880 align:middle line:84%
a witness that's
had an interaction

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.280 align:middle line:84%
with a UFO, the next day
a witness who's having

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.480 align:middle line:90%
a poltergeist experience.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.082 align:middle line:84%
And they all live within
3.5 miles of each other.

00:31:53.082 --> 00:31:54.530 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a hot zone.

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And so here is a
prime example of one

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:01.870 align:middle line:84%
of these areas that
has high quartz

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:04.780 align:middle line:84%
deposits underneath
in the topography that

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:08.320 align:middle line:84%
has these gigantic
electromagnetic fields that

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.880 align:middle line:90%
are being generated.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
it gets important,

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:14.050 align:middle line:84%
because it's these
electromagnetic fields that

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:18.670 align:middle line:84%
create a tear in the
membrane between dimensions.

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And it is nothing but an
electromagnetic membrane

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.810 align:middle line:84%
that separates our dimensions,
this dimension from the next.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a
tear in that membrane,

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:32.170 align:middle line:84%
you can have a momentary
interaction between dimensions.

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And we describe that
interaction as being paranormal.

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's why these
areas have this vast array

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:40.410 align:middle line:84%
of paranormal
activity all occurring

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:44.320 align:middle line:84%
within a pretty small geographic
area, because you are tearing

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.700 align:middle line:84%
the membrane between
dimensions, and you're causing

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:49.490 align:middle line:90%
this occurrence to occur.

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:54.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and the way I
see that is rather than a tear,

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:58.400 align:middle line:84%
it's like an excitation
of frequencies

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.410 align:middle line:84%
that happen and create
a permeability of sorts.

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:04.200 align:middle line:84%
It's like a phase
shift opportunity

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.640 align:middle line:84%
to be able to have a
bleed-through, so to speak.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:07.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And recently there
were some scientists

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:13.810 align:middle line:84%
who have published a lot of work
referring to the Mach Effect.

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:15.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a scientist
who's come up

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:19.995 align:middle line:84%
with a device that can
make use of the Mach Effect

00:33:19.995 --> 00:33:24.180 align:middle line:84%
to actually cause
propulsion in an object.

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:26.844 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're talking about
almost zero-point energy fields.

00:33:26.844 --> 00:33:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:31.260 align:middle line:90%
And we think of Mach 1, 2, 3.

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.970 align:middle line:84%
This almost sounds
like Mach in reverse.

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:33.850 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:36.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Well, basically
he's determined--

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.620 align:middle line:84%
and he has a device called a
Mach effect thruster that he's

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.390 align:middle line:84%
built that actually
picks up these fields

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:46.330 align:middle line:84%
and is able to
generate propulsion

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:48.370 align:middle line:90%
if you need to, but energy.

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And he believes, and
these new scientists

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.050 align:middle line:84%
believe, that using
the Mach Effect,

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:55.630 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be able to
produce spacecraft that have,

00:33:55.630 --> 00:34:00.640 align:middle line:84%
in effect, the ability to use
this type of zero-point energy,

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.580 align:middle line:84%
which is caused simply by
the movement of an object

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.280 align:middle line:90%
through space and time.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:06.440 align:middle line:90%
That's what's fascinating.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.489 align:middle line:84%
And what we have with
the Earth is an object

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:10.710 align:middle line:90%
moving through space and time.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:13.469 align:middle line:84%
And underneath in
these different areas,

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:16.540 align:middle line:84%
you have the
topography necessary

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:19.090 align:middle line:90%
in order to create this effect.

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, the third principle
of the Mach Effect

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:25.570 align:middle line:84%
is the ability to
produce benign wormholes.

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, going back to the
Skinwalker Ranch and one

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:31.989 align:middle line:84%
of their major interactions,
the scientists are up on a ridge

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:34.880 align:middle line:84%
overlooking an area that
they've had nonstop activity in,

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.389 align:middle line:84%
and then they're using
night-vision equipment

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:40.630 align:middle line:90%
and thermal binoculars.

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:44.429 align:middle line:84%
And they see a hole
open up in the ground,

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:46.360 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden,
this creature that

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:49.510 align:middle line:84%
is completely black
comes crawling up

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:50.980 align:middle line:90%
out of this hole in the ground.

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Any other descriptors?

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Well, not
many other than it

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:59.370 align:middle line:84%
was a very strange
and scary experience.

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:01.820 align:middle line:84%
But this creature crawled
up through a hole that

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.100 align:middle line:84%
was generated in
the ground and just

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.930 align:middle line:90%
walks off into the wilderness.

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's interesting
when you consider

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:11.060 align:middle line:84%
that the third principle
of the Mach Effect

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:13.610 align:middle line:84%
is the creation of
benign wormholes, which

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:16.840 align:middle line:84%
is what you need for this
interaction to occur.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's
occurring to me as you're

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:20.540 align:middle line:84%
saying this is
we're looking-- we

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:23.240 align:middle line:84%
also have parallel
timelines as well.

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.430 align:middle line:84%
We have non-linear
time and space.

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:27.050 align:middle line:90%
We have these frequency shifts.

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:30.110 align:middle line:84%
All this stuff is going
on simultaneously.

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And so you look
at it-- off camera

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:34.580 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about
the popularization

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:37.280 align:middle line:84%
of this theory of going
into these power spots

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.790 align:middle line:84%
and disappearing, so to speak,
in the series "Outlander,"

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:43.806 align:middle line:84%
which is so popular because
of Jamie Fraser I think.

00:35:43.806 --> 00:35:45.666 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, he's hot.

00:35:45.666 --> 00:35:49.910 align:middle line:84%
But women-- and men, but women
in particular love this series.

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:52.280 align:middle line:84%
But it starts out with
going into a power

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.680 align:middle line:90%
spot in the Scottish Highlands.

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And the woman disappears
from that timeline

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.090 align:middle line:90%
and is on a different timeline.

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:00.824 align:middle line:90%
And these things happen as well.

00:36:00.824 --> 00:36:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah,
fascinating that you

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:04.280 align:middle line:84%
mention that, because
it was Louis L'Amour who

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.940 align:middle line:84%
wrote the story "The
Vanishing Mesa," where

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:10.690 align:middle line:84%
the Anasazi basically
did the same thing.

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:13.640 align:middle line:84%
They went onto this power
spot and disappeared

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:14.800 align:middle line:90%
into another dimension.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And it could be that
that's exactly what we're

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.470 align:middle line:84%
looking at with
mass disappearances

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:20.270 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's happened
a number of times.

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:27.770 align:middle line:84%
There are entire Inuit
villages in northern Alaska

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:30.260 align:middle line:90%
that have just gone missing.

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:34.029 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of people there
one day, gone the next.

00:36:34.029 --> 00:36:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I wouldn't have
put these two together,

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:38.780 align:middle line:84%
but it's popping to mind,
so I'm just going to say it.

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:42.230 align:middle line:84%
When I was in Crestone
with Steven Greer's group--

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:43.760 align:middle line:90%
you remote view at night.

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.690 align:middle line:84%
If you can, you
remote view at night.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:47.360 align:middle line:84%
But usually people
are more trained,

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:50.659 align:middle line:84%
looking for extraterrestrial
stuff in the third dimension

00:36:50.659 --> 00:36:51.950 align:middle line:90%
or fourth dimensional spectrum.

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:53.660 align:middle line:90%
You can see with your naked eye.

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.090 align:middle line:84%
But as I was
viewing with them, I

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:57.950 align:middle line:84%
would often dial into
what was going on that

00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:59.760 align:middle line:90%
wasn't terrestrial per se.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:05.780 align:middle line:84%
But in that area, what I found
funny at the time is everyone

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:09.350 align:middle line:84%
is going like this,
and in the field behind

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:18.110 align:middle line:84%
us were these phased-off craft
all around-- right behind us.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And I said, guys, use
your inner eyes now.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole
bunch of stuff here.

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:26.240 align:middle line:90%
And so it's just hitting me.

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.060 align:middle line:84%
If you have that degree
of activity and craft

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:31.700 align:middle line:84%
that are phased off in
that dimensional field

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:36.560 align:middle line:84%
and these people are just
running along and phasing out,

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.110 align:middle line:84%
could there be an interaction
of some kind there?

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Absolutely, and it may
play into this new finding that

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:45.890 align:middle line:84%
was published in the Journal
of Modern Physics, the American

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:47.140 align:middle line:90%
Journal of Modern Physics.

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
tell us about this.

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: January 20
of this year, they

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:52.700 align:middle line:84%
published a new
article describing

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:55.820 align:middle line:84%
the use of these new telescopes,
where they're picking up

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.640 align:middle line:84%
these craft that are
completely, totally hidden

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.190 align:middle line:90%
using anti-matter particles.

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, how would you
ever detect that?

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And could be these
craft who are--

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you have
to use your inside eyes.

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:08.244 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:38:08.244 --> 00:38:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Could they also may be
responsible for a lot of

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:12.260 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm wondering,

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:14.930 align:middle line:84%
because when I was out
with Steven Greer's group

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:16.940 align:middle line:84%
in another place,
same thing happened.

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Each night it showed
itself, a semi-elliptical,

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:21.890 align:middle line:84%
semi-transparent
blue craft, right?

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:24.470 align:middle line:84%
But no one was seeing
it but me at the time

00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:26.840 align:middle line:90%
because it was inside.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:32.660 align:middle line:84%
The last day, we went out to the
crags in the Palm Springs area.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:35.030 align:middle line:90%
What's that called, Palm Desert?

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:36.670 align:middle line:90%
Joshua Tree.

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And someone actually
captured it on film,

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:42.510 align:middle line:84%
on digital film--
semi-elliptical,

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:45.710 align:middle line:84%
blue craft sitting right at the
base of exactly what I'd seen,

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:48.560 align:middle line:84%
this flat rock
against the crags.

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And it had this pink
auric field behind it.

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was right there exactly
as it was showing itself if you

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.800 align:middle line:90%
look into their dimension.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:01.390 align:middle line:84%
So again, these things
are all over the place.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel any sense
of fear around them.

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:04.820 align:middle line:90%
They're just there.

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:07.940 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, I
suppose if someone disappears

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.940 align:middle line:84%
in that general area, it
puts a different spin in it.

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:11.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: You gotta put
them on your suspect list.

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:15.050 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:15.885 align:middle line:90%
There's no choice.

00:39:15.885 --> 00:39:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
that's interesting.

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Which is
unfortunate, but I

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:22.610 align:middle line:84%
did have an amazing experience
in Crestone one night.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Went there to investigate
some lights that

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:28.520 align:middle line:84%
were being seen over the Great
Sand Dune National Monument.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And people familiar
with that area

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.400 align:middle line:84%
know the so-called ziggurat
outside of Crestone

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:37.316 align:middle line:84%
is actually just a spire
that is 50 feet tall that

00:39:37.316 --> 00:39:39.440 align:middle line:84%
was built by a group of
Buddhist monks in the area.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:40.870 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So I was going to
go to this spire

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and set up my surveillance
equipment at the top of it.

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.680 align:middle line:90%
It's overlooking the sand dunes.

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:48.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a perfect spot.

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:53.706 align:middle line:84%
So I'm approaching the ziggurat,
the so-called ziggurat.

00:39:53.706 --> 00:39:55.950 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And I had a buddy of mine
in a four-wheel drive.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:01.270 align:middle line:84%
He was taking me out there
to drop me off for the night.

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:03.380 align:middle line:84%
I was just going to camp
out on top of the spire.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.421 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You brave soul.

00:40:04.421 --> 00:40:05.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah, right.

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:07.550 align:middle line:90%
And so we're approaching it.

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very, very
tough four-by-four trail

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:12.910 align:middle line:90%
in order to get there.

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And we're going up
this little embankment,

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:19.220 align:middle line:84%
and up in front of us, we
see this figure, this man.

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:22.820 align:middle line:84%
He's wearing overalls
and this checkered shirt.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And he's got a floppy,
brimmed hat on.

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And you can't
really see his face.

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of makes
this hunched walk

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:33.450 align:middle line:90%
across the road in front of us.

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:35.792 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
maybe 50 yards or so.

00:40:35.792 --> 00:40:37.750 align:middle line:84%
We're thinking, oh, we're
going to get up here,

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:39.541 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be
some tourists and cars.

00:40:39.541 --> 00:40:43.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm gonna have to wait them out.

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.910 align:middle line:90%
And we think, oh, boy.

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:47.290 align:middle line:90%
So we keep going.

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And this figure makes
it clear across the road

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:51.940 align:middle line:90%
over into the bush line.

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:53.800 align:middle line:84%
Clearly we think he
sees us come and he's

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.390 align:middle line:90%
trying to get out of the road.

00:40:55.390 --> 00:41:00.570 align:middle line:84%
We pull right up to where he
should be, and there's nothing.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And this area is
wide open space.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:09.230 align:middle line:84%
It's scrub brush and cactus,
and there's nowhere to hide,

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:10.030 align:middle line:90%
absolutely.

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:13.270 align:middle line:84%
We look at each other
like, what was that, right?

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:16.060 align:middle line:84%
So I grab my equipment,
which includes

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.090 align:middle line:84%
really highly advanced thermal
imaging and night vision

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:19.890 align:middle line:90%
equipment.

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And I run to the top of
the spire, 50 feet up.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Had about 45 minutes
of sunlight left.

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And I take this equipment,
and I scan around

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:32.100 align:middle line:90%
in 360 degrees for 45 minutes.

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:35.740 align:middle line:84%
There's no movement at all in
an area where there's nowhere

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:37.960 align:middle line:90%
to hide.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And so this figure
just vanished.

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Appeared and vanished.

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right in front of us.

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not everybody
wears the floppy hat, right?

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Right, and
maybe what you're seeing

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.490 align:middle line:84%
is a denizen of one of
these other dimensions.

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:51.055 align:middle line:84%
And it's not particularly
frightening-looking

00:41:51.055 --> 00:41:52.150 align:middle line:90%
in and of itself.

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:54.910 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what is
in those other space.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Exactly.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we talked off
camera a little bit about this,

00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:03.130 align:middle line:84%
but I've had a theory about
it, just my viewpoint,

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:06.040 align:middle line:84%
about disappearing
species, where

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:09.660 align:middle line:84%
if we have gone through
this relatively almost

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:13.690 align:middle line:84%
lightning-speed shift that
Greg Braden used to talk about

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:17.020 align:middle line:84%
long ago in his original
work, which was what I loved,

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:20.020 align:middle line:84%
was the whole notion
that the planet is

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:24.520 align:middle line:84%
going through this dimensional
shift or sub-dimensional.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Probably wouldn't live through
a full-on, full-frontal

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:28.430 align:middle line:90%
dimensional shift.

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:30.916 align:middle line:84%
But let's say a
sub-dimensional shift clearly

00:42:30.916 --> 00:42:33.040 align:middle line:84%
from the third into the
fourth and have pretty much

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.540 align:middle line:90%
accomplished that.

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Not all things,
not all life forms,

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:42.460 align:middle line:84%
are equipped to travel that
same path in terms of changing

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:44.620 align:middle line:90%
its own dimensional density.

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that many of the
rapidly disappearing species,

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:51.730 align:middle line:84%
where the whole
species is just gone,

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:55.720 align:middle line:84%
is simply a function of their
phased into this dimension

00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:58.030 align:middle line:84%
or remaining in
one-dimensional field

00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:59.890 align:middle line:84%
while the rest of
what we see has

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:01.660 align:middle line:90%
progressed into the new one.

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:02.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Exactly.

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And you hear a lot of
times the term "life wave."

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, it could be that these
different species are actually

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.150 align:middle line:90%
existing on their own frequency.

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:12.980 align:middle line:90%
They're still there right.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And those frequencies
can't make it

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:17.430 align:middle line:90%
into this particular reality.

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:20.136 align:middle line:84%
But they're still there,
living on their frequency.

00:43:20.136 --> 00:43:20.936 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:43:20.936 --> 00:43:21.970 align:middle line:90%
That's what I think.

00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:24.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they've just
died out and become extinct.

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:27.050 align:middle line:84%
I think they're just
where we can't see them.

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And we've had evidence,
I mean certainly

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.040 align:middle line:90%
in ancient lore about dragons.

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:36.790 align:middle line:84%
But in addition, some astute
beings-- and a channel

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:39.580 align:middle line:84%
we had in recently, I
asked about these things.

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:42.752 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no, dragons
lived in your domain

00:43:42.752 --> 00:43:44.210 align:middle line:84%
once upon a time,
but that was when

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:45.370 align:middle line:90%
the frequencies were different.

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:46.370 align:middle line:90%
And they're still there.

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:47.727 align:middle line:90%
They're just phased off.

00:43:47.727 --> 00:43:48.685 align:middle line:90%
You can't see them now.

00:43:48.685 --> 00:43:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's interesting
you bring up dragons,

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:55.810 align:middle line:84%
because we've had a number of
recent modern-day pterodactyl

00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:56.740 align:middle line:90%
sightings.

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: That would
almost fit the bill.

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:04.579 align:middle line:84%
And this includes animal
kills that look like they

00:44:04.579 --> 00:44:05.870 align:middle line:90%
have been killed by something--

00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:07.495 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I have
read about these.

00:44:07.495 --> 00:44:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: From the air,
looks like these creatures

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:12.700 align:middle line:84%
are leaving three-toed
prints in the ground,

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.120 align:middle line:84%
so they're leaving
physical evidence behind.

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And we've begun to
wonder whether or not,

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:20.110 align:middle line:84%
because we know so
little about some

00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:22.210 align:middle line:84%
of these prehistoric
creatures, did some of them

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:25.960 align:middle line:90%
go into a type of hibernation?

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.695 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're
beginning to reawaken

00:44:27.695 --> 00:44:30.987 align:middle line:84%
in different remote areas
like northern New Mexico.

00:44:30.987 --> 00:44:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or they could
be even bleeding through--

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Bleeding through
inter-dimensionally.

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:40.360 align:middle line:84%
I had a witness who came to
me from England, actually,

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.230 align:middle line:90%
a scientist.

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And he brought up an
interesting point.

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:46.360 align:middle line:84%
He said, did it
ever occur to you

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:49.300 align:middle line:84%
that all of these different
cryptozoological animals

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:53.710 align:middle line:84%
that we keep seeing all came
from the same time span?

00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:56.516 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that
they're still there,

00:44:56.516 --> 00:44:58.390 align:middle line:84%
they're just bleeding
back into this reality.

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:00.473 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's my belief,
is they're still there

00:45:00.473 --> 00:45:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and that during that time span,
the frequencies of the planet

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:04.780 align:middle line:90%
were very different.

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:06.050 align:middle line:90%
It shifted.

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: And they all existed
within a 20-million-year period

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:11.260 align:middle line:84%
of each other, which
is a blink of an eye.

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:12.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
look at it that way,

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:19.479 align:middle line:84%
I mean again, you can say one
has rose-colored glasses on,

00:45:19.479 --> 00:45:21.520 align:middle line:84%
but there you can view
the world and this reality

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:22.900 align:middle line:90%
anyway you want, right?

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And I tend to look at it just--
I don't tend to approach it

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:28.150 align:middle line:90%
with fear per se.

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's just
as logical to assume

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:34.610 align:middle line:84%
that as to assume they've
all been poisoned and died

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:35.410 align:middle line:90%
overnight.

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:36.966 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right, exactly.

00:45:36.966 --> 00:45:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That usually
doesn't happen that quickly.

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah, exactly,
and we're always

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:44.770 align:middle line:84%
interested when physical
evidence is left behind,

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:48.400 align:middle line:84%
because that then shows
us how this can interact

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:52.180 align:middle line:84%
with our reality and how
real it can become to us,

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:54.280 align:middle line:84%
even though you're
talking about frequencies

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.380 align:middle line:90%
and fields and everything.

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:59.230 align:middle line:84%
To us, it's no different than
the solidity of this table.

00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:01.480 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:04.460 align:middle line:84%
OK, so another area that
you're interested in right now,

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:06.400 align:middle line:84%
which I find
fascinating, is-- I love

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:10.247 align:middle line:84%
the story on this planet of all
the different types of species

00:46:10.247 --> 00:46:11.830 align:middle line:84%
that are humanoid,
that have been here

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:16.060 align:middle line:84%
before-- the giants with
fascinating red hair

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and interesting clothing on
from 15,000, 20,000 years ago.

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:21.560 align:middle line:90%
These guys are great.

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:25.370 align:middle line:84%
But all of it-- I mean, in
Ohio, the king and queen

00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:26.790 align:middle line:90%
that were buried intertwined.

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:32.380 align:middle line:84%
She's covered in pearls
all around the body,

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:35.140 align:middle line:90%
the giants of Sardinia.

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.730 align:middle line:90%
And now the little people.

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we have the
little floresiensis,

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:41.050 align:middle line:84%
I guess Indonesia, the
little hobbit people.

00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And you have some interesting
things you're looking into.

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: I do.

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Recently JC Johnson, who founded
Crypto Four Corners, of which

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm the vice president,
began to conduct

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:55.120 align:middle line:84%
an investigation in
northern Minnesota

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:57.460 align:middle line:84%
and to Native American
reports of what

00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:00.328 align:middle line:84%
they call the [INAUDIBLE],
or the little people.

00:47:00.328 --> 00:47:01.494 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The little people.

00:47:01.494 --> 00:47:02.294 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:47:02.294 --> 00:47:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And this comes at a time after
discovery of a non-human hobbit

00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:09.680 align:middle line:84%
species-- they've proven
now that they were

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:13.820 align:middle line:84%
non-human-- on the island
of Flores off of Indonesia,

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:15.940 align:middle line:84%
they're called
Homo floresiensis.

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:17.150 align:middle line:90%
And this species may--

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're like
two and a half feet tall.

00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:20.775 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: Yeah, tiny,
tiny little things.

00:47:20.775 --> 00:47:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating was that
they were hunting little pygmy

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:26.867 align:middle line:84%
animals on the same
island, little pygmy

00:47:26.867 --> 00:47:27.700 align:middle line:90%
elephants and stuff.

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do we have any
idea of how long ago this

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:31.905 align:middle line:90%
may have been at all?

00:47:31.905 --> 00:47:33.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: That I don't know.

00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:36.780 align:middle line:84%
I'll have to re-look at
what their finding was.

00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:38.840 align:middle line:84%
It was at least a couple
of million years ago.

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And these remains were found
in a cave on the island.

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And at first, it was
just a huge controversy.

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:49.030 align:middle line:84%
How could you have different
species like this living

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:51.490 align:middle line:90%
on the same planet and stuff?

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:54.100 align:middle line:84%
But what we're
beginning to see is

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.100 align:middle line:84%
that it's possible that
this species that we have

00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:02.740 align:middle line:84%
a scientific record of now
may have an offshoot, a cousin

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:07.326 align:middle line:84%
species, if you will, living
in northern Minnesota.

00:48:07.326 --> 00:48:08.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What evidence
have you found?

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: We've collected
photographic evidence of them,

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:14.830 align:middle line:84%
which is now on the Paranormal
Intelligence Agency website.

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:17.290 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
photographic evidence

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:22.030 align:middle line:84%
we have, along with a lot of
Native American witnesses.

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is something
that we've always

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:27.760 align:middle line:84%
held in high value, because
what we've discovered

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:32.890 align:middle line:84%
is that the indigenous first
nations people of North America

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:37.930 align:middle line:84%
are often totally honest with us
with what they're experiencing.

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was through
this interaction,

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:45.970 align:middle line:84%
basically, with elements of the
Navajo Nation in northern New

00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Mexico that we were able to
obtain DNA from Sasquatch.

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:53.241 align:middle line:84%
That was, in fact, a part of
two separate genome studies.

00:48:53.241 --> 00:48:54.490 align:middle line:90%
Most people just have no idea.

00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
to go there, too.

00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:59.170 align:middle line:84%
But here in northern
Minnesota, we

00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:00.890 align:middle line:84%
have that same sort
of relationship.

00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And we had a number of
Native Americans approach

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.500 align:middle line:84%
Crypto Four Corners
and say, yeah, we've

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:07.150 align:middle line:90%
seen these creatures.

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:08.680 align:middle line:84%
We believe some
of these creatures

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:11.930 align:middle line:84%
are responsible for a
recent missing persons case.

00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:13.750 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that fascinating?

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These
tiny little guys?

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:19.026 align:middle line:84%
And they've got a pretty
fearsome reputation

00:49:19.026 --> 00:49:20.400 align:middle line:84%
among the Native
American people.

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:22.130 align:middle line:84%
What are they known
characteristically?

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: They're known
for abducting people.

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what do
they do with the people?

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: They eat them.

00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh!

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:26.834 align:middle line:90%
Well--

>>CARY: [LAUGHING]

00:49:27.318 --> 00:49:28.286 align:middle line:90%

[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, we want to
stay away from those caves.

00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:35.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Right.

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:39.850 align:middle line:84%
But we believe we've obtained
a picture of one of them.

00:49:39.850 --> 00:49:42.220 align:middle line:84%
They are described as
being greenish in color.

00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:45.790 align:middle line:84%
We think that's because of the
amount of plant chlorophyll

00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:48.460 align:middle line:84%
that they consume in their
diet, actually, and the fact

>>CARY: OK, so not only was
our group able to obtain DNA,

00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:33.420 align:middle line:84%
but in the first genome
study, which was headed by Dr.

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Melba Ketchum, she had over
100 samples taken from various

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:39.761 align:middle line:90%
researchers all around--

00:50:39.761 --> 00:50:40.968 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All over the world?

00:50:40.968 --> 00:50:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: All over
the world, mainly

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:49.530 align:middle line:84%
in North America, that basically
became part of a vast genome

00:50:49.530 --> 00:50:50.860 align:middle line:90%
study.

00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And what they were able to
determine in this first genome

00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:58.680 align:middle line:84%
study is that about 12,000
to 15,000 years ago there

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:03.550 align:middle line:84%
appears to have been a hominid
species, upright walking, just

00:51:03.550 --> 00:51:06.150 align:middle line:84%
like the Homo
floresiensis hobbits,

00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:09.960 align:middle line:84%
but a large species
that is right

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:14.340 align:middle line:84%
now still uncatalogued in
biology and in science.

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:18.550 align:middle line:84%
Because they've never
found the bones, right?

00:51:18.550 --> 00:51:23.945 align:middle line:84%
But this species, at a time
that scientists believe

00:51:23.945 --> 00:51:26.220 align:middle line:84%
a cometary impact
occurred on the planet

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:29.800 align:middle line:84%
12,000 to 15,000 years ago,
the Younger Dryas Period,

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:33.440 align:middle line:84%
ended up interbreeding
with archaic human females.

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And they produced the
lineage that we now

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:39.080 align:middle line:90%
call Sasquatch, or Bigfoot.

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating is
when you look biblically

00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:45.130 align:middle line:84%
into the story of
Esau, you have what

00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:49.950 align:middle line:84%
appears to be a description
of this very event occurring.

00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:53.220 align:middle line:84%
It is a disguised
parable of the offshoot

00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:56.020 align:middle line:90%
of this part of humanity.

00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Esau was born clutching
Jacob's ankle.

00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:00.460 align:middle line:84%
He's covered in long,
red hair, and he

00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:02.940 align:middle line:84%
becomes a wild man
of the woods that

00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:05.610 align:middle line:90%
could hunt down prey on foot.

00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:07.590 align:middle line:84%
You're describing
exactly what we're

00:52:07.590 --> 00:52:09.840 align:middle line:90%
seeing on a modern-day level.

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:12.670 align:middle line:84%
This is describing this
offshoot of humanity

00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:15.550 align:middle line:84%
as coming from the
same bloodline.

00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And these become
the forest-dwellers,

00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.840 align:middle line:84%
the wild people, while
Jacob becomes the very first

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.560 align:middle line:90%
tent-dwelling society.

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So you get to see
the splitting off

00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:28.510 align:middle line:84%
of these two
lineages of humanity,

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:30.992 align:middle line:84%
because that's
what the DNA shows.

00:52:30.992 --> 00:52:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, talk about that.

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CARY: It shows that 12,000 to
15,000 years ago, this breeding

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:37.710 align:middle line:90%
interaction occurred.

00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, these
creatures have human DNA.

00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that has
implications for all of us

00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:49.590 align:middle line:84%
and for anyone who's
interested in the species,

00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:53.610 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that they have
a human-like intelligence

00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:57.036 align:middle line:84%
with what appears to be
superhuman-like physical

00:52:57.036 --> 00:52:57.836 align:middle line:90%
abilities.

00:52:57.836 --> 00:53:00.360 align:middle line:90%


00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:05.730 align:middle line:84%
We're now convinced through
a second genome study--

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:09.880 align:middle line:84%
two summers ago we went on
a really, really successful

00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:14.320 align:middle line:84%
expedition in which we were able
to collect fresh DNA from two

00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:17.530 align:middle line:84%
locations in northern New
Mexico that were separated

00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:20.260 align:middle line:90%
by 80 miles of terrain.

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Both of them had witnesses
to the DNA being left.

00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, we got the
executive director

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:30.280 align:middle line:84%
of the University of New Mexico
Gallup, Dr. Christopher Dyer,

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:33.690 align:middle line:84%
to accompany us to
collect the samples so

00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:37.780 align:middle line:84%
that we made sure there was
no contamination whatsoever.

00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Now that's part of a
second genome study,

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:43.740 align:middle line:84%
and sure enough, it
corroborates the first.

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.930 align:middle line:84%
This breeding
interaction did occur.

00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:47.410 align:middle line:90%
These creatures are real.

00:53:47.410 --> 00:53:49.650 align:middle line:84%
They are no longer
a mystery to us.

00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:51.670 align:middle line:84%

Erickson Project,

00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:53.830 align:middle line:84%

Google and pull up

that DNA was taken
from in Kentucky.

00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:02.820 align:middle line:90%
We named her Mildred.

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:06.029 align:middle line:90%
And so she's got a nickname.

00:54:06.029 --> 00:54:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Often researchers give
these creatures a nickname

00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:08.950 align:middle line:90%
because they seem so human.

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:10.283 align:middle line:90%

00:54:10.283 --> 00:54:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>CARY: Yeah.

00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:13.405 align:middle line:84%
But they were able to
walk right up to her,

00:54:13.405 --> 00:54:14.700 align:middle line:90%
take hair right off of her.

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:16.720 align:middle line:90%
