00:00:17.614 --> 00:00:19.530 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: We
have a real treat today,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.890 align:middle line:10%
as Paola Harris joins us
with extremely rare photos

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.530 align:middle line:10%
from the collection of
the late Wendelle Stevens.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Paola is one of the
rare UFO researchers.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.690 align:middle line:84%
She's modest, and makes no
claims over others, rather,

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.230 align:middle line:84%
relentlessly moving ahead in her
boots on the ground research.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.050 align:middle line:84%
This dedication has put her
in rarefied circles of trust

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.240 align:middle line:84%
with real contactees,
real witnesses.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And she has loads to
share with us today.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.860 align:middle line:84%
I have never seen some
of these images before,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.552 align:middle line:90%
so I'm really excited.

00:00:45.552 --> 00:00:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
sharing them here

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.110 align:middle line:84%
on this show, because
this is a real treat.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.350 align:middle line:84%
I said that before,
and I really meant it.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.225 align:middle line:90%
>>PAOLA HARRIS: Yeah.

00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, some of the
images come from Italy, too.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.270 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of people have trusted
me with these amazing images.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.090 align:middle line:10%
And I share them
in my presentations

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.140 align:middle line:10%
that I'm doing now.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.680 align:middle line:90%
I'll be speaking--

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.075 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And people go nuts
over your presentations.

00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, because
it's real material.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.320 align:middle line:90%
It isn't hypothetical.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.540 align:middle line:90%
It's real material.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, OK.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.340 align:middle line:84%
So we have to get into
this right up front,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.877 align:middle line:84%
to set the groundwork
for this conversation.

00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:18.210 align:middle line:90%
I've known you for years, right?

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Mm-hmm.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you used to
say, psh, contactees, right?

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.720 align:middle line:84%
You know, you kind of,
if you couldn't touch it,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.184 align:middle line:84%
if it didn't have metal or some
kind of military story to it

00:01:28.184 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:84%
that had been documented, you
weren't really that into it.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.390 align:middle line:84%
You were thinking a lot of
people were kind of loopy

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.800 align:middle line:90%
and making things up.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.210 align:middle line:90%
That's not the case anymore.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.150 align:middle line:84%
Something has taken
you over into the field

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.641 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and contact
around the UFO story.

00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
consciousness is the light

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.820 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the tunnel of
the nuts and bolts research

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.600 align:middle line:84%
I was doing, because I
started with Allen Hynek,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.660 align:middle line:90%
putting pins in maps.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.918 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And then I didn't
care what was inside the craft.

00:01:55.918 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:90%
I just was reporting data.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.350 align:middle line:90%
And we have enough data.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.980 align:middle line:84%
So I had to graduate
to graduate school.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:01.980 align:middle line:10%
This is graduate school.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.650 align:middle line:10%
Consciousness and contact
is graduate school.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it happened
to me in very weird ways,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.220 align:middle line:84%
because I began
working in Italy,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.910 align:middle line:84%
because I was in Italy
from 1992 to 2007.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.310 align:middle line:84%
I had lived near Rome,
near the Vatican.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I began doing
stories in Italy.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see some of
the images from those.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And those contactees trusted
me with these Polaroids

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.440 align:middle line:90%
of these beings on ships.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.200 align:middle line:10%
And then I came back
to the United States,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.060 align:middle line:10%
and I said, well, if there's,
like, human-type beings that

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.550 align:middle line:10%
are visiting people
in Italy, there

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.660 align:middle line:10%
must have been human-type space
people visiting people here

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:10%
in America.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And I had to go way back
to the Giant Rock days,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.790 align:middle line:84%
to Adamski, to Menger, to George
Van Tassel, to Robert Short,

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.110 align:middle line:90%
to all those people.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And then that's when I got
these incredible photos

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.290 align:middle line:84%
from the Wendelle Stevens
archive, of Menger

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.460 align:middle line:90%
with these Venusians.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And then, so I said,
where'd they go?

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.430 align:middle line:84%
All these people in the
'50s and '60s, what?

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.460 align:middle line:90%
Did they all go home?

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Because now our field is
only abductions, only little

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Grey aliens, only
cartoon-like situations.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.585 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A less
elegant turn was taken.

00:03:15.585 --> 00:03:15.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was done, I
think in the '60s,

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.150 align:middle line:84%
with the Betty and Barney
Hill abduction case.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.890 align:middle line:84%
But it was very convenient
for the managers

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.600 align:middle line:84%
of the UFO phenomenon, because
that keeps people under fear.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And you can't bond
with a clone, which

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.000 align:middle line:84%
is an extraterrestrial
biological entity, as Colonel

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.120 align:middle line:90%
Corso told me.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.920 align:middle line:90%
You can't bond.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.930 align:middle line:84%
But with these people,
with these space people,

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.410 align:middle line:84%
you can invite
them to Starbucks.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And if we start
empathizing and feeling like

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.470 align:middle line:84%
God created people
on other planets,

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.836 align:middle line:84%
it really runs contrary
to whoever is managing--

00:03:53.836 --> 00:03:55.710 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going to
use the word government.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the government
is managing this--

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.500 align:middle line:84%
who's managing the
disclosure of UFOs.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And managing public
perception toward an end.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Like you say, there was a
distinct turn that happened

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.855 align:middle line:84%
from what was
essentially friendly,

00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:84%
kind of Earth-friendly
messages--

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.605 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Space
brother movement.

00:04:13.605 --> 00:04:17.839 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Space brother--
even human-like entities,

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.640 align:middle line:84%
attractive human-like
entities, as you say,

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.811 align:middle line:84%
to Mantis entities
to Grey entities--

00:04:23.811 --> 00:04:24.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: To Reptilian--

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To
Reptilian entities--

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and I mean, really,
to the dark side of the UFO

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.250 align:middle line:90%
phenomena.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying the other
entities don't exist.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.370 align:middle line:84%
But what happened as a directive
to shift our focus away

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.580 align:middle line:84%
from the positive
to the frightening?

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to add that
I was very close to John

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.119 align:middle line:90%
Mack, of Harvard University.

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:46.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, we all love him.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.875 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I love the man.

00:04:46.875 --> 00:04:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And he
told me that the DNA

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.180 align:middle line:84%
harvesting and that
program had ended in 1994.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.610 align:middle line:84%
So I'm wondering why in the
world we're still on that

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.480 align:middle line:90%
and we can't get past that.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.610 align:middle line:84%
So what I've learned in Latin
America, in Argentina, Peru--

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:03.630 align:middle line:90%
I've been to Chile.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.960 align:middle line:90%
I've been to Colombia.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.070 align:middle line:84%
What I learned there
was much more solid

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.680 align:middle line:84%
information about who is
really visiting the planet now,

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.850 align:middle line:90%
and why.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you going
to share that with us?

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.872 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I knew you
were going there.

00:05:19.872 --> 00:05:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it would
be irresponsible of me

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.620 align:middle line:90%
not to ask that question.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: OK.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, the thing is that
after I did all the research

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.870 align:middle line:84%
on the Giant Rock
group and I brought

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Robert Short back to Giant
Rock to do channeling--

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.109 align:middle line:84%
and I'll talk about
that in detail,

00:05:35.109 --> 00:05:36.650 align:middle line:84%
because I think
everybody should know

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.030 align:middle line:84%
that those people that were
early contactees really

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.590 align:middle line:90%
had it right--

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.880 align:middle line:84%
then I started going to Latin
America, to Sixto Paz Wells.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.140 align:middle line:10%
And all the followers
of Sixto Paz,

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.150 align:middle line:10%
and that's Enrique Villanueva--

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.730 align:middle line:10%
I think you've had
him on the show--

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.429 align:middle line:10%
and Ricardo Gonzalez, and--

00:05:56.429 --> 00:05:57.470 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: All lovely men.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.210 align:middle line:90%
I've met all of them.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.090 align:middle line:90%
They're delightful.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And Luis Mostajo
Maertens and just those--

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.480 align:middle line:84%
I did six interviews on
Skype with an interpreter,

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.630 align:middle line:84%
because it's very difficult,
because I don't speak Spanish.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.710 align:middle line:90%
But I need to know.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.980 align:middle line:84%
I needed to know what they saw
and what the messages were.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.904 align:middle line:84%
So what had happened
is, I got the--

00:06:22.904 --> 00:06:24.320 align:middle line:84%
and they're on my
YouTube channel,

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.800 align:middle line:84%
all these Spanish Latin
American contactees.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is it paolaharris.com?

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: YouTube channel?

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.890 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, under
the YouTube Channel.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And what they told
me was that in the 1970s,

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Sixto Paz went into
the Chilca Desert,

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.010 align:middle line:84%
and with automatic writing,
was able to have contact

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:47.780 align:middle line:84%
with witnesses, 100 witnesses,
because they camped out there.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And the beings would
give them precise times

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.740 align:middle line:90%
that the craft would land.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And they were all
young boys at the time.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.400 align:middle line:84%
I even interviewed
Sixto's brother, Charlie,

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.090 align:middle line:84%
who has transgendered
into Veronica Paz Wells.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.660 align:middle line:84%
But I got two witnesses
of that group that told me

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:10.250 align:middle line:84%
that the beings would be
at the door of the craft

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.520 align:middle line:84%
and invite these
young boys to come in.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.180 align:middle line:90%
That's unbelievable.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And that the message
was that they

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.720 align:middle line:84%
were wanting to make contact
with the Latin Americans.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.510 align:middle line:84%
Today, 2014, when I went to
Chile with Ricardo Gonzalez

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and he had contact, the
message was ecological.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.650 align:middle line:84%
The message that Ricardo got
from those beings on that ship,

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.110 align:middle line:84%
those beings from
Apu, was that we would

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.950 align:middle line:90%
have a problem with water.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:42.140 align:middle line:10%
So here we are in
2015, in Atacama,

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.602 align:middle line:10%
in the Atacama Desert of
Chile, and they're telling us

00:07:44.602 --> 00:07:46.310 align:middle line:10%
we're going to have
a problem with water.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:46.676 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:07:46.676 --> 00:07:47.476 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:07:47.476 --> 00:07:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, water,
we had three hurricanes,

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.440 align:middle line:90%
major hurricanes--

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.680 align:middle line:84%
rain constant, an
imbalance in the planet.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.730 align:middle line:84%
So if anybody out there is
wondering what the messages are

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.070 align:middle line:84%
today, they are no
longer nuclear power,

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:06.430 align:middle line:84%
even though I think they're
worried about our capability

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.900 align:middle line:90%
of destroying ourselves.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.235 align:middle line:84%
The messages are
heavily ecological.

00:08:10.235 --> 00:08:11.035 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:11.035 --> 00:08:11.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's fair enough.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's been going on,
actually, for quite a long time

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:14.830 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.630 align:middle line:84%
So it begs the
question-- also, we

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.526 align:middle line:84%
have these amazing
photographs that are new.

00:08:19.526 --> 00:08:20.650 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are new to me.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.650 align:middle line:84%
I've seen quite a lot,
but not some of these.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.300 align:middle line:90%
Who was Wendelle Stevens?

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And how does he factor
into this story,

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:32.650 align:middle line:84%
and his archive which was sought
after as rarified material?

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Wendelle Stevens was, I
think, the best researcher

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.320 align:middle line:90%
in the whole world.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.730 align:middle line:10%
And I have photos of him.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.549 align:middle line:10%
But I also interacted with him
at the Laughlin Conference.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.480 align:middle line:10%
But you know, Wendelle Stevens
researched the whole thing.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.180 align:middle line:10%
He was the only one that brought
international people here.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.620 align:middle line:90%
He would go to South America.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.610 align:middle line:90%
He would go to Italy.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.490 align:middle line:90%
He would go to different places.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.630 align:middle line:84%
So what's important
about the archive

00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:84%
that I have is the Howard
Menger photos and the Val Thor

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:01.840 align:middle line:90%
pictures.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:04.870 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: Because
what you'll see

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.870 align:middle line:10%
is that I began doing research
on August Roberts, who

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:12.730 align:middle line:10%
was the photographer on the
Howard Menger gatherings.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:17.920 align:middle line:10%
Howard and his first wife,
Rose, they would hold court.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.530 align:middle line:10%
And they would have 100
people in their orchard.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.740 align:middle line:10%
And what would happen, on
one particular occasion,

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:24.940 align:middle line:10%
he told August Roberts--

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.599 align:middle line:10%
I have the audio tape of that--

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:28.390 align:middle line:10%
there's going to be
three people there that

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.160 align:middle line:10%
are not from this planet.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And August Roberts
later said in the tape,

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:36.822 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know who they were,
but they were overdressed.

00:09:36.822 --> 00:09:37.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For a picnic.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:38.738 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: For a picnic.

00:09:38.738 --> 00:09:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, they looked
like actors from Hollywood.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:42.550 align:middle line:90%
So there's a--

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's take-- we
can take a look at some of them

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.500 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So here they are.

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And tell us who the
three of them are.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And identify, besides Valiant
Thor, who the others were.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, Valiant Thor
is sitting on the outside.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.070 align:middle line:90%
And there's his brother, Don.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.130 align:middle line:90%
And then there's Jill.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.880 align:middle line:10%
And Jill, I guess, from
the book, "Stranger

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.260 align:middle line:10%
in the Pentagon," is one of the
commanders of a ship, his ship,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:07.460 align:middle line:10%
Victor One, which is supposedly
parked at Lake Mead in Nevada.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.070 align:middle line:10%
So here are these photos.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.900 align:middle line:10%
Some of them are color and some
of them are in black and white.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.890 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
slides that I have

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:19.630 align:middle line:84%
is the letter from August
Roberts, who took these photos.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And he said, these people were
different from the other people

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.270 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.104 align:middle line:10%
So I think this is--

00:10:24.104 --> 00:10:26.020 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I mean, a lot
of people look at this

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.180 align:middle line:10%
and say, well, they just
look like handsome people

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.140 align:middle line:10%
overdressed for a picnic, right?

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:30.940 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It is, except
that you have to take

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.030 align:middle line:90%
the testimony of Howard Menger.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And Howard Menger, High
Bridge, New Jersey,

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.990 align:middle line:84%
was the East Coast
version of Adamski.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.610 align:middle line:90%
And basically, Howard Menger--

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
this, because some people

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:44.690 align:middle line:90%
don't know--

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.231 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have done
a couple of shows

00:10:46.231 --> 00:10:48.040 align:middle line:90%
that included Adamski in them.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.420 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's fair
to set it up again,

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.140 align:middle line:84%
who Adamski was, because
we're going to be looking

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:56.380 align:middle line:84%
into his photos as well,
and also who Menger was,

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and some of the chief
characteristics of him

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.170 align:middle line:90%
that made him different.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:06.070 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: OK, well,
Adamski was, in 1952,

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:11.140 align:middle line:10%
had an incredible encounter
in Desert Center with a human

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.750 align:middle line:10%
being from Venus named Orthon.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:14.970 align:middle line:10%
And it is provable.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:10%
I've also left you some
photos of his plaster

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.000 align:middle line:10%
casts of his feet.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.720 align:middle line:10%
And you need to go
to Glenn Steckling,

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:27.410 align:middle line:10%
to Adamski Foundation, because
he's kindly provided those.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And when a being
comes off a ship

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:35.260 align:middle line:84%
and there are two sets of
plaster casts of his feet,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.290 align:middle line:90%
and there's six witnesses--

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:41.380 align:middle line:84%
I think they were six-- and
the plaster casts were made

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:42.651 align:middle line:90%
by George Hunt Williamson--

00:11:42.651 --> 00:11:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what was unique
about the plaster casts?

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, because
there's markings

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.540 align:middle line:90%
on the soles of the shoes.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:49.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.110 align:middle line:90%
So just that they existed.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The markings on
the soles of the shoes.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're
different markings

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.710 align:middle line:90%
on either sole of the shoe.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it wasn't
only that that happened,

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.250 align:middle line:84%
at that particular-- this
is November 20, 1952.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.420 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.670 align:middle line:90%
With all those witnesses.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but Adamski had
given, upon request, to Orthon,

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:20.110 align:middle line:84%
a glass plate, because
they used to do photographs

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.180 align:middle line:90%
on glass plates in those days.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was returned
on December 13,

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:29.550 align:middle line:84%
with all these
hieroglyphic-type writing on,

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:33.070 align:middle line:84%
that then they did research
on later in Brazil,

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:38.440 align:middle line:84%
and found out that that was
a symbol or kind of writing.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.010 align:middle line:84%
So what happened is you
have real artifacts.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:43.180 align:middle line:90%
You have his shoes.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.500 align:middle line:90%
You have six witnesses.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.680 align:middle line:90%
And you have this glass plate.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.790 align:middle line:84%
So the Adamski story has
been totally dismissed.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.380 align:middle line:90%
That's-- I found that--

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.690 align:middle line:84%
I feel about him like
I felt about John Mack,

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.260 align:middle line:84%
that there was something
that was true and elegant

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.330 align:middle line:90%
about George Adamski.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And he invited people
to ask questions,

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.040 align:middle line:84%
to try to tear apart
what he's saying,

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.840 align:middle line:84%
to try to disprove
what he's saying.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.840 align:middle line:84%
He would even offer
people money to find out

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.550 align:middle line:84%
if there was an
alternative answer that

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.460 align:middle line:84%
might have been more powerful
than what was shared with him.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.470 align:middle line:84%
He really tried to
put it to the test.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
what contactee has

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.400 align:middle line:90%
physical evidence like he had?

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, and not only
that, he had a mandate.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.340 align:middle line:10%
And the mandate was
to go around the world

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:31.980 align:middle line:10%
and talk to different
heads of state

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.800 align:middle line:10%
and Pope John XXIII,
who gave him a medal--

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:40.380 align:middle line:10%
I've seen the medal-- and tell
him that we are on a time line

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.130 align:middle line:10%
where we can make money
going into outer space

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.070 align:middle line:10%
with a space economy,
because he talked to John F.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:51.940 align:middle line:10%
Kennedy about this, or we have
to stay with the war economy.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.430 align:middle line:84%
But if we do, we have
to create the wars.

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was right on.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So you have
points in a timeline.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And I believe we're
at one right now,

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.970 align:middle line:84%
because I believe that
we have that choice now,

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.520 align:middle line:90%
where you can go in.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And we have it with the
privatization, with SpaceX,

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:10.670 align:middle line:90%
with the privatization--

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:11.751 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we're
going to talk about that

00:14:11.751 --> 00:14:12.880 align:middle line:90%
and show some recent film.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.296 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
we had that, where

00:14:14.296 --> 00:14:16.500 align:middle line:84%
we can actually go
into outer space

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.600 align:middle line:90%
and create a whole economy.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.090 align:middle line:84%
But you not only
create an economy.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.600 align:middle line:84%
You get to meet
the space people.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.400 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's the extra
added attraction.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:90%
Because you get off this planet.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.040 align:middle line:84%
You have an economy that will
take you to other planets.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Or you've got to stay with
what we started in the 1950s,

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:37.815 align:middle line:84%
with the military
industrial complex.

00:14:37.815 --> 00:14:40.369 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A destructive war
economy that serves only a few.

00:14:40.369 --> 00:14:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And the only
way that you could do that

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:46.110 align:middle line:84%
is by pouring money
into conflicts.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.364 align:middle line:90%
And I don't want that anymore.

00:14:47.364 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what people want.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I think
everybody watching

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.810 align:middle line:84%
this is going to say
they're done with that.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he
was 50 years ago,

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:54.870 align:middle line:84%
trying to give a
heads up, that this

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.400 align:middle line:90%
was going to be a choice point.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.595 align:middle line:90%
We made the choice point.

00:14:57.595 --> 00:14:58.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: We made it.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now we're
standing-- and it

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.510 align:middle line:90%
went into the war economy.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And then people like him,
his voice was shut down.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.310 align:middle line:84%
He was virtually relegated
to total obscurity,

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:06.120 align:middle line:90%
for the most part.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And also, criticism
from our own people.

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.440 align:middle line:84%
But he's buried in
Arlington National Cemetery.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:90%
Explain that to me.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
explain that one.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.105 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's fascinating.

00:15:15.105 --> 00:15:16.500 align:middle line:90%
And he was an unusual person.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:84%
I remember this one
thing about him,

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.280 align:middle line:84%
when I think I was talking
to Glenn Steckling,

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.430 align:middle line:84%
is that he didn't
have a belly button.

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, he didn't.

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.820 align:middle line:90%
He had--

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.653 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was a
different kind of person.

00:15:25.653 --> 00:15:29.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He had a star
symbol, 6-inch raise coming out

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.590 align:middle line:90%
of his belly button.

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
but Glenn actually

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.950 align:middle line:84%
said that the Star People
would come into the house,

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:40.740 align:middle line:84%
that they looked like
young, blonde men who

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:41.580 align:middle line:90%
were wearing suits.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:42.871 align:middle line:90%
Again, they were wearing suits.

00:15:42.871 --> 00:15:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And they would accompany
George on his lectures,

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:49.150 align:middle line:90%
especially in Germany.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.370 align:middle line:90%
They'd get into the car.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.544 align:middle line:84%
And I was going, you
see these people?

00:15:52.544 --> 00:15:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, yeah,
they're people.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.530 align:middle line:90%
They're people, regular people.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And they come from--
well, what got

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.940 align:middle line:84%
me was that they said
they came from Venus.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So then I had to look
at Eugenio Siragusa, who said

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.500 align:middle line:90%
his people came from Venus.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Then I had to look at Howard
Menger on the East Coast

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.890 align:middle line:84%
that said that the people
he met came from Venus.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to look at
the story of Elizabeth Klarer

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:21.150 align:middle line:84%
in South Africa, "Beyond
the Light Barrier,"

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.704 align:middle line:90%
who also met human-type aliens.

00:16:23.704 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to say
that they're Nordics,

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:29.940 align:middle line:84%
because we have this
very bad habit of shoving

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.070 align:middle line:90%
57 different races--

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:35.610 align:middle line:84%
Clifford Stone told me,
57 different races--

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:37.570 align:middle line:84%
into Nordic,
Reptilian, and Grey.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:39.570 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So I
mean, these people

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.290 align:middle line:90%
say they come from Venus.

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And the Clarions say
they come from Clarion.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.300 align:middle line:90%
And people come from Sirius.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And Ricardo said
they come from Apu.

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:53.160 align:middle line:10%
You've got different people,
who are not all Nordic,

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.510 align:middle line:10%
coming from different places.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:56.280 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But these
are humanoid entities.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:56.870 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: They're people.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:57.690 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they're people.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:58.731 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: They're people.

00:16:58.731 --> 00:17:00.910 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Human
entities, or people.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things
I think that I found

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.720 align:middle line:84%
so fascinating, just
about-- and we'll hop over

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.900 align:middle line:84%
to the East Coast and Menger,
but about Adamski's work,

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:14.280 align:middle line:84%
was the information
he left behind,

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:20.940 align:middle line:84%
that Fred Steckling documented,
showed what it looks like,

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.000 align:middle line:84%
in a culture that has
overcome the adversity of war

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.530 align:middle line:84%
in this case, which is the
way that Adamski was shown

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:33.240 align:middle line:84%
the life on Venus, for example,
the social structure of Venus.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And so it almost was
laying a template

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.750 align:middle line:84%
for what we could aspire
to as human beings.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.277 align:middle line:84%
And I found it really
quite beautiful.

00:17:42.277 --> 00:17:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, certainly not only
was there nothing threatening

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:45.735 align:middle line:90%
about it, it was beautiful.

00:17:45.735 --> 00:17:49.200 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that,
the technology that

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.800 align:middle line:84%
was explained to him about
how interstellar space

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.900 align:middle line:84%
travel actually
works, these rivers

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.790 align:middle line:84%
of energy that our
world of science

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:58.500 align:middle line:84%
is just now beginning
to discover,

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.432 align:middle line:84%
and they just laid
it out for him,

00:18:00.432 --> 00:18:01.890 align:middle line:84%
essentially in
English, or at least

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.110 align:middle line:84%
it was translated
into English, has

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:07.320 align:middle line:84%
been there for the last 50 years
for anyone with eyes to see.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.380 align:middle line:90%
And we've ignored it.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: We have.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.346 align:middle line:84%
And you know, some of the
images you're going to see

00:18:11.346 --> 00:18:15.900 align:middle line:84%
are the Adamski craft, with
the energy balls underneath.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.890 align:middle line:84%
But those aren't
just photographs.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:22.690 align:middle line:84%
There's movie footage of that,
of this craft coming down.

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:23.490 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No one has said that
these pictures are adulterated.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: No, but they
couldn't have been.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.250 align:middle line:90%
They were 1952.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.450 align:middle line:90%
Photoshop started in 1992.

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.380 align:middle line:84%
But people, when they're
first exposed to this kind

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.590 align:middle line:84%
of imagery, say, oh, well,
that's got to be faked somehow.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:39.390 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: But they're not basing
their opinion on any analysis.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, they're not.

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:43.490 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.854 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And for me,
opinion isn't research.

00:18:45.854 --> 00:18:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Just like, and I'm going to
go really fast into this, just

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.353 align:middle line:90%
like the Billy Meier case.

00:18:49.353 --> 00:18:51.010 align:middle line:90%
I went to Switzerland.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:52.290 align:middle line:90%
I've seen Billy Meier.

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:56.020 align:middle line:84%
I saw the movies of the craft
underneath the highways.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.080 align:middle line:84%
So you know, Wendelle
Stevens, who did

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.910 align:middle line:90%
that, I trust Wendelle Stevens.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:01.170 align:middle line:90%
He did that case.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Explained how when he
was Meier's chalet, how

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.640 align:middle line:84%
he could see Meier
walk out the door

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.070 align:middle line:84%
and his footprints
disappeared in the snow.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:20.010 align:middle line:84%
So we have real positive
testimony of great researchers

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:21.600 align:middle line:90%
who have done that case.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And the excuse is, the
pictures are too good.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is,
I think we have

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:29.282 align:middle line:84%
to take into consideration,
like we talked about,

00:19:29.282 --> 00:19:30.990 align:middle line:84%
George Adamski not
having a belly button.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:32.310 align:middle line:90%
He's a different entity.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:36.030 align:middle line:84%
That these entities have chosen
to incarnate here specifically

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:39.780 align:middle line:84%
for the purpose to act as a
bridge between other cultures

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.560 align:middle line:84%
of human beings
on other planets.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And you know, another thing
I think that was explained

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.110 align:middle line:84%
in Steckling's books was that--
and I think this came from

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.050 align:middle line:90%
Adamski--

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:51.180 align:middle line:84%
is that there were
something like 400,000

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.610 align:middle line:90%
different human frame.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:58.500 align:middle line:84%
This is the preferred vehicle
for sentient, conscious beings

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.010 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universes.

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Right.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not only are we
not the only human beings.

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:06.060 align:middle line:84%
He said, I think, 400,000
other planets, at least,

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.112 align:middle line:90%
had this kind of body.

00:20:08.112 --> 00:20:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, people.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: People.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:10.035 align:middle line:90%
Had people.

00:20:10.035 --> 00:20:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Had people.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.850 align:middle line:90%
They had people on them.

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And
Monsignor Balducci,

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.620 align:middle line:90%
who was a good friend of mine--

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.152 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Monsignor
Balducci, yeah.

00:20:17.152 --> 00:20:17.952 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:20:17.952 --> 00:20:20.070 align:middle line:84%
He used to say, well,
you know, it's normal.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:23.640 align:middle line:84%
He said, God didn't just
create us on this planet

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.600 align:middle line:90%
to look like this.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.280 align:middle line:84%
He created people
on all the planets.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And then he added, he
said, in the Bible,

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:84%
Christ is called the King of
the Universe, not the King

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:37.890 align:middle line:90%
of Planet Earth, 66 times.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.080 align:middle line:90%
He counted them-- 66 times.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.980 align:middle line:84%
So for me, apart from
my doing the research--

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.640 align:middle line:84%
and I have to do
the research here.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.350 align:middle line:90%
Hearsay isn't enough for me.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.725 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, you
go on location.

00:20:48.725 --> 00:20:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I go on location.

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:51.240 align:middle line:90%
I have to see the photos.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.810 align:middle line:84%
I have to see the
analysis and so forth.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:55.725 align:middle line:90%
It's just logical.

00:20:55.725 --> 00:20:57.100 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Of course
it's logical.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: It's logical.

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
still, it's logical,

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.409 align:middle line:84%
but it's still
titillating to people

00:21:02.409 --> 00:21:04.740 align:middle line:84%
who are starting to get
comfortable with this idea.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And the pictures that
we're showing today

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.030 align:middle line:84%
are giving proof
of these entities.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And although we
may all be people,

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:15.120 align:middle line:84%
there are slight differences,
oftentimes, in our appearance.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Like you say, you can be a
little taller, a little paler,

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:20.117 align:middle line:84%
a little bluer, a
little larger-eyed.

00:21:20.117 --> 00:21:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Have
different kind of skin.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.241 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have
different kind of skin

00:21:23.241 --> 00:21:25.590 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, for the
atmosphere, wherever you live.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:26.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Right.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:29.235 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so let's
go from George Adamski--

00:21:29.235 --> 00:21:31.960 align:middle line:84%
not George Adamski,
but go back to Menger

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.740 align:middle line:90%
and what was happening there.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:38.229 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Menger, poor Howard,
he got so much slack from

00:21:38.229 --> 00:21:39.270 align:middle line:90%
the government, because--

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:42.152 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because he featured
the Venusians, Valiant Thor?

00:21:42.152 --> 00:21:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: No, because
they would come in.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.030 align:middle line:84%
They would come in
the back of his house.

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And I really want to go to
High Bridge to see that house.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And he'd have the FBI agent
there when they would come in.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:55.330 align:middle line:84%
He's got photographs
of these people.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:56.580 align:middle line:90%
But the problem with--

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.620 align:middle line:84%
and you will see them
in the photographs,

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.230 align:middle line:84%
because you'll see Menger
and his second wife, Connie,

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:05.785 align:middle line:84%
in the orchard-- is that
when these beings are

00:22:05.785 --> 00:22:07.910 align:middle line:84%
in the photograph and he's
got his arm around them,

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:09.750 align:middle line:90%
they appear as pure light.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that
was interesting.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.480 align:middle line:90%
It's like, whoa.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.540 align:middle line:10%
That's a little kind of
anomaly, a little bit

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:19.140 align:middle line:10%
of flash coming into the
picture from elsewhere.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.600 align:middle line:84%
But that form was where
a person was standing.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It was a person
that was standing there.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:25.090 align:middle line:90%
All you see is their aura.

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:28.740 align:middle line:84%
But since they can bilocate
and since they can transport

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.050 align:middle line:84%
themselves-- because
he had a situation--

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:33.780 align:middle line:84%
if you read "From
Outer Space to You,"

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.030 align:middle line:84%
he had a situation where
they would appear in the ship

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and then they would appear
in his yard right away.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.082 align:middle line:90%
This kind of change--

00:22:41.082 --> 00:22:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of
bilocation, yeah.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:42.896 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:22:42.896 --> 00:22:44.880 align:middle line:84%
This kind of bilocation
is going to be

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.190 align:middle line:84%
tricky to take
photos of the people

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:50.370 align:middle line:84%
if they are actually
able to do that.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.870 align:middle line:84%
But you have another
historical photo,

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:56.540 align:middle line:84%
in that the government said,
for national security purposes,

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:57.341 align:middle line:90%
deny your story.

00:22:57.341 --> 00:22:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Well, deny your story.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And he was also sick
and tired of people

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.790 align:middle line:84%
coming to his
backyard to be healed,

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:08.440 align:middle line:84%
because when we have contact,
we create a religion out of it,

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.300 align:middle line:84%
or a cult. And they
go to the contactee,

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.360 align:middle line:90%
and then they ask to be healed.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.122 align:middle line:90%
And they follow them around.

00:23:15.122 --> 00:23:16.080 align:middle line:90%
And they become a guru.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And you know how
this whole thing--

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People can't
help give their power away.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:20.925 align:middle line:90%
That's a problem on our planet.

00:23:20.925 --> 00:23:22.300 align:middle line:84%
That's what we've
been taught, is

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.730 align:middle line:84%
to give all of our personal
authority and power away.

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:26.050 align:middle line:90%
So we'll follow anything.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:27.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: That's
exactly-- you know,

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:29.260 align:middle line:90%
and that's the big tragedy.

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.330 align:middle line:84%
They say, why don't
they land and help us?

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:34.420 align:middle line:90%
And we create another religion.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.480 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, he did
deny it, his story,

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.210 align:middle line:84%
even though he worked
in Colorado Springs

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.110 align:middle line:90%
on propulsion system.

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:42.742 align:middle line:90%
Didn't realize that.

00:23:42.742 --> 00:23:43.950 align:middle line:90%
He worked for the government.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:45.730 align:middle line:84%
But there is a photo,
which is historic,

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:48.670 align:middle line:84%
from the Wendelle Stevens
archive, of his standing

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:53.110 align:middle line:84%
at the University of Colorado
in 1969 with his book

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:55.830 align:middle line:84%
open in front of Edward Condon,
that was the Condon Committ--

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Condon Report.

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:57.996 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: The Condon Report.

00:23:57.996 --> 00:23:59.115 align:middle line:90%
So if he was not real--

00:23:59.115 --> 00:24:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why were
they talking to him?

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.073 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Why were they talking?

00:24:02.073 --> 00:24:04.240 align:middle line:84%
He's there wit his wife,
Connie, opening the books,

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.190 align:middle line:84%
showing Condon
that this was real.

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:07.398 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And quickly explain
the Condon Report, just

00:24:07.398 --> 00:24:09.040 align:middle line:84%
in a flash here, in
30 seconds or less,

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:10.720 align:middle line:84%
so people know what you're
talking about-- context.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: OK.

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.350 align:middle line:84%
The Air Force had a
special study group.

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And they commissioned
Edward Condon,

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.580 align:middle line:84%
at University of Colorado, to
study all the cases, including

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:23.860 align:middle line:90%
the Malmstrom Air Force case.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And Condon came up
with this report

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.310 align:middle line:90%
that was really a whitewash.

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:30.190 align:middle line:10%
Everybody was very angry,
including my friend, Allen

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:32.380 align:middle line:10%
Hynek, that it was
a whitewash, that

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.360 align:middle line:10%
said there was nothing to this.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And that report, I
think, is in the library.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.880 align:middle line:90%
And he was a debunker.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.140 align:middle line:84%
He was hired to
say these things.

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:42.940 align:middle line:90%
But that--

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.515 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that became
the official report.

00:24:44.515 --> 00:24:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yes,
from the Air Force.

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:46.405 align:middle line:90%
From the Air Force.

00:24:46.405 --> 00:24:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From the
Air Force, right.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: From the Air Force.

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:48.734 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So there you go.

00:24:48.734 --> 00:24:49.900 align:middle line:90%
That's how that thing works.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:50.980 align:middle line:90%
And we kind of know--

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:54.970 align:middle line:84%
I think one thing I like about
the "Incident in Rendlesham

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:58.909 align:middle line:84%
Forest," Pope's book, is that
it's the anatomy of a cover up.

00:24:58.909 --> 00:25:01.450 align:middle line:84%
So anyone that says, well, if
this stuff is true, how come we

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:02.586 align:middle line:90%
don't know about it?

00:25:02.586 --> 00:25:04.210 align:middle line:84%
I always recommend
they read that book,

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:06.310 align:middle line:84%
because you can see from
the time of the incident,

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:10.510 align:middle line:84%
in Britain, all the way through,
where the cover up started,

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:13.120 align:middle line:84%
who gave who the orders, where
things started disappearing.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.200 align:middle line:90%
Then the photos are gone.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Then they said don't
do this interview.

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And all the data starts
changing until lips are zipped.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.810 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing's been
erased, until now.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Now we have this huge
pouring forth of information

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.295 align:middle line:84%
in the last decade
on all these affairs.

00:25:29.295 --> 00:25:30.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
you know, that is

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:34.690 align:middle line:84%
an important case,
because with the '50s,

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:36.220 align:middle line:90%
the warning was nuclear.

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: OK.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.000 align:middle line:84%
So what we're dealing
with, my research,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.080 align:middle line:84%
is that sightings are over
nuclear installations.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And then Rendlesham had
that nuclear arsenal there

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.450 align:middle line:84%
that nobody knew about
in Great Britain,

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:52.806 align:middle line:84%
and said the UFO is shining
a light on that thing.

00:25:52.806 --> 00:25:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I always say
to people, look.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:58.400 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is visiting
or whoever is visiting,

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.410 align:middle line:90%
it's not on vacation.

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They're giving
us a specific message,

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:06.610 align:middle line:84%
or they're showing
us our insanity.

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And there is still hope that
we can grow up and become

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.860 align:middle line:84%
a very enlightened
civilization, because they

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:19.540 align:middle line:84%
care, because there are
people out there that

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.480 align:middle line:84%
look at this planet, this
gorgeous planet, and say,

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.440 align:middle line:90%
give them a chance.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.427 align:middle line:90%
Give the humans a chance.

00:26:25.427 --> 00:26:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
that's something--

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:29.650 align:middle line:84%
I've spoken at StarWorks
USA, your conference.

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And you know, a lot of people
responded to that talk,

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.520 align:middle line:84%
because they were
sensing something

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.900 align:middle line:84%
that fit the way they feel
about themselves in there.

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And if that story, that
rendering of our human origins

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:43.630 align:middle line:84%
is true, which I would
encourage anybody

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:45.010 align:middle line:90%
can look at, thanks to you.

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:46.384 align:middle line:84%
They can go to
reginameredith.com

00:26:46.384 --> 00:26:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and they can see
that talk, so they'll

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.720 align:middle line:84%
know what we're
talking about here.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.140 align:middle line:84%
This traumatic origins
of the human being,

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:56.770 align:middle line:84%
where we are these incredibly,
highly creative, highly

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:59.560 align:middle line:84%
intuitive, ability to create
at the speed of thought,

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.260 align:middle line:84%
beyond what a lot of these
visiting entities are,

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.080 align:middle line:84%
at our core, it has
to be very challenging

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.750 align:middle line:84%
for all these different
beings from other places,

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:09.700 align:middle line:84%
these other human
species, to look at us

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and say, when are they
going to remember?

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:14.380 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a matter
about learning.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.870 align:middle line:84%
This is a matter of
simply remembering

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:20.200 align:middle line:84%
what we are, because we're
a magnificent species.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, I'm on the
same wavelength, Regina.

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:24.850 align:middle line:84%
You just went to
the bottom line,

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:26.080 align:middle line:90%
and that is consciousness.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And you were absolutely--
everybody loved you.

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:31.360 align:middle line:84%
The cheers when
you were on stage--

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.160 align:middle line:84%
you opened that
conference, because that's

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.080 align:middle line:90%
where my heart is right now.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And the only way I can reach
the maximum amount of people

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:42.430 align:middle line:84%
is to be the producer of the
Laughlin Conference, which is

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:44.130 align:middle line:90%
November 2 through 4 this year.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And the
theme this year

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:47.600 align:middle line:84%
is the return of
the Star People.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.870 align:middle line:84%
So basically it's
Native American,

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and the aboriginal cultures
that had this in there.

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
we have to start

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.130 align:middle line:84%
listening to all these
voices and giving them

00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:58.570 align:middle line:90%
all credibility.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:01.780 align:middle line:84%
It's all these little pixels,
these pieces in the mosaic,

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.420 align:middle line:84%
that are going to come together
and kind of tile together

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:07.220 align:middle line:84%
to create the big picture
for us in the end.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And again, to me, it's only
about remembering what we are.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And then when you tap into that,
this species is unstoppable.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:17.605 align:middle line:84%
But even so, they
say, people, wake up,

00:28:17.605 --> 00:28:18.730 align:middle line:90%
you're ruining your planet.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:20.271 align:middle line:84%
You're pooing in
your own nest, here.

00:28:20.271 --> 00:28:21.150 align:middle line:90%
This is not smart.

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Don't shoot that
stuff up into space.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.505 align:middle line:84%
You've forgotten how
to use it wisely.

00:28:25.505 --> 00:28:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And really, they're like,
please let them wake up.

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:31.270 align:middle line:84%
There are still things that
some of the other species

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:33.700 align:middle line:84%
find intriguing about us
and beautiful about us.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And we rarely have that
reflected back to us.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, we live
in a chaotic world.

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:40.690 align:middle line:84%
I just posted on
Facebook, I don't

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:43.090 align:middle line:84%
know how we're going to
live through this insanity,

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:44.970 align:middle line:90%
because logic does not reign.

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Some of the things I've
been seeing are illogical.

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:53.740 align:middle line:10%
If you have a sense of logic,
and I deal a lot with logic,

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:55.210 align:middle line:10%
we live in insanity.

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:57.460 align:middle line:10%
I'm trying to navigate
around all the insanity,

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:00.630 align:middle line:10%
because it's not
making any sense.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:01.480 align:middle line:90%
But I have hope.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.220 align:middle line:90%
And we have to have hope.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:07.480 align:middle line:84%
So we'll go ahead
and go through this,

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.430 align:middle line:84%
like they went through
it in the olden days,

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:10.570 align:middle line:90%
because we have hope.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
enlightened people out there.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:13.900 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: There are.

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:15.910 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: And I notice
even my own field--

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:17.800 align:middle line:10%
and I'm very discouraged
about my own people,

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.212 align:middle line:10%
because my own field has
become entertainment.

00:29:20.212 --> 00:29:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
it's not only that.

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:24.070 align:middle line:84%
It's become-- people
have become kind

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:25.930 align:middle line:84%
of part of a personality
cult, when they

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:27.700 align:middle line:90%
used to be called researchers.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Ego has stepped in, people
putting down other people's

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.780 align:middle line:90%
research and work.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:33.620 align:middle line:90%
It's become competitive.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:34.870 align:middle line:90%
And you don't engage in that.

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:37.879 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're one of
the only females, and one

00:29:37.879 --> 00:29:39.836 align:middle line:84%
of the only people that
doesn't engage in that.

00:29:39.836 --> 00:29:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: No, because
it's a waste of my time.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.810 align:middle line:84%
I know how they feel
though, because what

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:46.709 align:middle line:84%
I've done, the field research,
the interview with Paul

00:29:46.709 --> 00:29:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Hellyer, that was
all nuts and bolts.

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:50.237 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had to pay for
that out of my pocket.

00:29:50.237 --> 00:29:51.320 align:middle line:90%
I've never been sponsored.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.960 align:middle line:90%
So my kids are going, Mom--

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Former minister
of defense, Canada.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:55.188 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, Canada.

00:29:55.188 --> 00:29:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I've interviewed,
goodness, Colonel Corso,

00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.920 align:middle line:84%
in my latest book,
"Conversations

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:00.810 align:middle line:90%
with Colonel Corso."

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You know everybody.

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.433 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Everybody.

00:30:02.433 --> 00:30:05.230 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed people
all over the world.

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:07.690 align:middle line:84%
My children are
saying, Mom, you've

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:12.094 align:middle line:84%
made a decision to
spend your retirement

00:30:12.094 --> 00:30:13.510 align:middle line:84%
doing these things,
when you could

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:16.820 align:middle line:84%
be sitting in the Caribbean and
enjoying your life somewhere.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You?

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:18.809 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:30:18.809 --> 00:30:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And I go,
well, you know, I

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:21.516 align:middle line:90%
don't think I have a choice.

00:30:21.516 --> 00:30:24.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you leave a legacy--

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and you're leaving one
and I'm leaving one--

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:32.140 align:middle line:84%
behind you when you choose
to incarnate on this planet.

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And the legacy
I'm leaving I hope

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:38.020 align:middle line:84%
is a scholarly one, because
all of my five books, all

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.890 align:middle line:84%
of the interviews are
word-for-word audiotape

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:43.060 align:middle line:90%
of what the people said.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:47.350 align:middle line:84%
So my great hope is, even
with these contactees,

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:49.150 align:middle line:90%
here's the material.

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:50.170 align:middle line:90%
Read it all.

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:51.460 align:middle line:90%
Study it all.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Watch these shows,
like the ones like I--

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Decide where you
want to put yourself on it.

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.325 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And decide
yourself what you believe.

00:30:58.325 --> 00:30:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And so this is
how I used to teach school,

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.200 align:middle line:84%
because you know I have
a master's in education.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.590 align:middle line:90%
I used to teach high school.

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:06.670 align:middle line:90%
You decide.

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:11.610 align:middle line:84%
You decide what makes sense,
what you can resonate with.

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And then whatever happens,
you've made the decision.

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you are
responsible, then you're

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:19.930 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
change this planet,

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:22.540 align:middle line:84%
because we're not on a really
good trajectory right now.

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And once you know something,
you can't really erase it.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:29.560 align:middle line:84%
You can try to ignore it,
but that makes you ignorant.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.065 align:middle line:84%
And that's really kind
of-- if there's any sin,

00:31:32.065 --> 00:31:34.240 align:middle line:84%
it's to know something
and then choose

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:39.340 align:middle line:84%
to ignore it, simply to go aside
or be without that knowledge.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a
good point you make.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have more images coming
up that we cannot ignore.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Once you've seen something,
you cannot unsee it.

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, you
know, let's go to Italy,

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:50.770 align:middle line:84%
because when I was
in Italy, I was

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:54.160 align:middle line:84%
doing eye work for a magazine,
even now, called "X Times."

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's Phoenix
Publishing in Rome.

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And I went to interview
Maurizio Cavallo, who

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:07.090 align:middle line:84%
was a follower of our
Adamski, Eugenio Siragusa.

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:10.240 align:middle line:84%
In the '50s, Eugenio Siragusa,
on the island of Sicily,

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:15.850 align:middle line:84%
met people in blue spacesuits
that were from Venus.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:18.580 align:middle line:10%
And you have some
slides of Eugenio

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:22.660 align:middle line:10%
and the handshake, the
messages that we got, that we

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.300 align:middle line:10%
are one family, one species.

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.670 align:middle line:10%
And then in that,
the young boys,

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:31.210 align:middle line:10%
just like the Sixto Paz
story, one of the boys

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:33.310 align:middle line:10%
was Maurizio Cavallo.

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:35.050 align:middle line:90%
And he's got startling eyes.

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:36.620 align:middle line:90%
I have an image.

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:38.870 align:middle line:90%
He became an artist later on.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And he had a contact
in 1980 with a group

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:44.320 align:middle line:90%
of people from Clarion.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And he was allowed to take
Polaroid pictures of them

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.830 align:middle line:90%
and keep them in a drawer.

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:53.250 align:middle line:84%
So when I went to do the story--
this is the amazing part.

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:56.550 align:middle line:84%
When I went to do the
story, I wasn't convinced.

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:57.610 align:middle line:90%
So I went home.

00:32:57.610 --> 00:32:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, most people
have never heard of Clarion,

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:00.070 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:01.090 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk a little bit--

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And I wasn't convinced
that they were people--

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.796 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --about
that background.

00:33:02.796 --> 00:33:05.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --that he went
on ship, that he actually

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:08.760 align:middle line:84%
let me hear their voice, because
he had a tape recorder that

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:09.960 align:middle line:90%
would go on by itself.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.705 align:middle line:90%
And their voices would be taped.

00:33:12.705 --> 00:33:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And he let me hear
the voices, which

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.590 align:middle line:84%
is the same as the
Amicizia case, which

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:19.110 align:middle line:84%
is the same as the
days of Robert Short

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:24.780 align:middle line:84%
and Van Tassel in Giant
Rock, where they were talking

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:28.660 align:middle line:84%
to these people on crystal
radios and on ham radios.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.650 align:middle line:84%
So in the old days,
the beings could talk.

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened was
it took me three times

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:36.690 align:middle line:84%
going to Vercelli
to do the story.

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:39.900 align:middle line:84%
The third time, because
I wasn't convinced--

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.150 align:middle line:90%
I don't just do a story.

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:45.700 align:middle line:10%
The third time, he said to me,
you know, Paola, my contact,

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:49.290 align:middle line:10%
Suell-- and you have
an image of him--

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:50.820 align:middle line:10%
works in a bank in Rome.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.290 align:middle line:10%
And he picked me up in a car.

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:55.770 align:middle line:10%
We went to a villa in Tuscany.

00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:58.540 align:middle line:84%
He said there were the beings,
beautiful looking beings.

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.180 align:middle line:90%
The women were very beautiful.

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.601 align:middle line:90%
Men looked like models, almost.

00:34:02.601 --> 00:34:04.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, Venus
is known for beauty.

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Even in our astrology of
Venus, it brings beauty.

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Oh, I never
thought of that.

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:08.429 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's about beauty.

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I never--

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:10.631 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Beauty
and grace and love--

00:34:10.631 --> 00:34:12.270 align:middle line:90%
that is the frequency of Venus.

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:14.219 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And so
these people were

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:16.931 align:middle line:84%
growing their own
vegetables in this villa.

00:34:16.931 --> 00:34:19.139 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Maurizio, you
sat down with these people?

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:19.770 align:middle line:90%
He said yeah.

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:21.853 align:middle line:84%
He says, now, Paola, you've
come back three times.

00:34:21.853 --> 00:34:24.480 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm going to
show you something I

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.130 align:middle line:90%
haven't shown anybody, he said.

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:29.010 align:middle line:84%
But, he said, Suell, my
contact 10 years ago,

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:31.530 align:middle line:84%
said there was an
American journalist that's

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:34.290 align:middle line:90%
going to come and see you.

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:36.960 align:middle line:90%
We call her the bridge.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.730 align:middle line:90%
You can show her those photos.

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:40.949 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I did
what I was told.

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:42.030 align:middle line:90%
I kept them in a drawer.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And when he showed
me these pictures--

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now we're
taking a look right now.

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:46.122 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:34:46.122 --> 00:34:46.530 align:middle line:90%
I said--

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:48.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us what we're
seeing in these photos.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: You're seeing
different beings aboard ship.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.400 align:middle line:90%
He said it was a federation.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:58.260 align:middle line:84%
But so did Eugenio Siragusa
say that the visitations aboard

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.540 align:middle line:84%
ship, there were
different types of peoples

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:06.870 align:middle line:84%
from different planets that
had a mandate to come here

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:08.250 align:middle line:90%
for various reasons.

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And Suell and the
little Clarion girl

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and a couple of
other of the beings

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:17.150 align:middle line:90%
work among the regular people.

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:18.030 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On Earth, you mean.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: On Earth.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:23.560 align:middle line:10%
So you know, I'm going to
recommend a book called

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.360 align:middle line:10%
"'We are Here!'

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.870 align:middle line:10%
Visitors without Passports,"
by Michel Zirger,

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:30.390 align:middle line:10%
that has all of
the documentation

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:35.600 align:middle line:10%
of all these cases where these
beings are working among us.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And they do their like, stint
among us as like an internship,

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.420 align:middle line:90%
and go back to their planet.

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:45.166 align:middle line:90%
And this I'd never heard of.

00:35:45.166 --> 00:35:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And when he pulled out
the Polaroids, I said,

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.290 align:middle line:90%
you couldn't have faked these.

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:49.590 align:middle line:90%
They're all Polaroids.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yes,
these are Polaroids.

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:52.610 align:middle line:10%
He said, and--

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:54.480 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: We do see
some unique features

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.380 align:middle line:10%
in the face of the
little girl, for example,

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:57.630 align:middle line:10%
which we'll look at right now.

00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:00.240 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: She's got bluish skin
and her ear is down to here.

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.850 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And
tiny, little mouth,

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:05.555 align:middle line:10%
as though eating and
talking with your lips

00:36:05.555 --> 00:36:07.800 align:middle line:10%
aren't necessary.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.460 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.620 align:middle line:10%
And also, there were
some hybrid Greys

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:14.170 align:middle line:10%
that you're going
to see in there.

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:15.628 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
what you often

00:36:15.628 --> 00:36:20.210 align:middle line:84%
see in renderings of
hybrids, human-Grey hybrids.

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Right.

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's a couple
of photos at them.

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And then there were some
interdimensional people.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And there's one photo
that I didn't bring,

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:29.880 align:middle line:84%
that the woman looks
like Grace Kelly.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.620 align:middle line:84%
But she also looks
like the woman that's

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.030 align:middle line:90%
sitting next to Val Thor--

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --gorgeous,
beautiful, blonde lady.

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:38.930 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: And ask it--

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:42.270 align:middle line:10%
and the people that
Billy Meier, you know--

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:46.590 align:middle line:10%
the fact that they would be
Dean Martin's gold diggers, one

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:49.320 align:middle line:10%
of the gold diggers from
Dean Martin's dancers,

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:54.240 align:middle line:10%
that Billy would go and
find one woman and go--

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.070 align:middle line:10%
I mean, he didn't
watch Dean Martin.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:57.660 align:middle line:90%
He lives in Switzerland.

00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:00.270 align:middle line:84%
He lives in Switzerland,
in [INAUDIBLE],,

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:02.910 align:middle line:90%
in this little town.

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:05.160 align:middle line:84%
But there was a photo
with the Billy Meier case

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.100 align:middle line:90%
of a beautiful, blonde lady.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.810 align:middle line:90%
And it's OK.

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:12.779 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we just have to
accept, there's people there.

00:37:12.779 --> 00:37:14.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's talk
about Clarion, though.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.820 align:middle line:84%
The being from Clarion,
this federation

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.940 align:middle line:84%
that met with them,
what was their story?

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.770 align:middle line:90%
What was their message?

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
basically, the contacts

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.770 align:middle line:90%
he had were in the French Alps.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:28.030 align:middle line:90%
He had movies.

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:29.567 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I'm
watching all this.

00:37:29.567 --> 00:37:30.400 align:middle line:90%
This is a big story.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:34.550 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Japanese offered
to buy Maurizio Cavallo's

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:36.997 align:middle line:84%
Polaroids, and he said,
aliens are not for sale.

00:37:36.997 --> 00:37:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, excellent.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They offered him
a great amount of money.

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good for him.

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: But they did
invite him to Japan.

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.880 align:middle line:84%
If you know that Japan
is taking the Billy Meier

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.180 align:middle line:84%
case and all the medals and
everything, they bought that.

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:51.300 align:middle line:90%
They brought Maurizio to--

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.610 align:middle line:90%
we didn't do that.

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:54.530 align:middle line:90%
Italy didn't do that.

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:57.960 align:middle line:84%
They brought him to
Japan to testify.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.320 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese are really
interested in these cases.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's where, a lot of
times, this information goes.

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:08.790 align:middle line:84%
The federation story
is a "Star Trek" story.

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:10.140 align:middle line:10%
It's the "Star Trek" story.

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:13.410 align:middle line:84%
It's all these different
peoples on a ship

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:16.350 align:middle line:84%
to come on a field
trip, because I don't

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.510 align:middle line:84%
think that Maurizio
told me they had

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:20.340 align:middle line:90%
a specific message, except--

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, did they
have a specific task

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:25.650 align:middle line:84%
in coming here and doing
their internship, so to speak?

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:27.390 align:middle line:84%
What were they
looking to take away?

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, they're looking
to take away how we live,

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.220 align:middle line:84%
how we think, and
what our emotions are.

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:33.636 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did they
say why they're

00:38:33.636 --> 00:38:35.775 align:middle line:90%
intrigued with this species?

00:38:35.775 --> 00:38:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It's just like we
would go and do anthropology

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.790 align:middle line:90%
in another country or another--

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:45.210 align:middle line:84%
I think they're all
cosmic anthropologists.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:47.820 align:middle line:84%
I think, basically,
they're watchers.

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:48.990 align:middle line:90%
They're watching.

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:52.210 align:middle line:84%
They're watching and waiting,
waiting for us to grow up.

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:56.040 align:middle line:84%
But I think that's what
their primary function is.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that there would
be different species on a ship

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:02.040 align:middle line:90%
is also from Eugenio Siragusa.

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:07.650 align:middle line:84%
It's also from other cases that
I've studied that it isn't just

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:08.700 align:middle line:90%
people from Clarion.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:12.870 align:middle line:84%
It's people from other star
systems that are coming here.

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And Maurizio was just,
he was very clear.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.800 align:middle line:84%
He said, you know, these
people are telling me

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.480 align:middle line:90%
that I'm connected with them.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:24.797 align:middle line:10%
So I said, well, then-- if
you look at his eyes, he--

00:39:24.797 --> 00:39:25.880 align:middle line:10%
some of these contactees--

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:26.650 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: What were they like?

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:27.990 align:middle line:90%
A dark blue, or something?

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Maurizio's eyes
are a clear, liquid blue.

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And he was also,
remember, he was

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:36.950 align:middle line:90%
a follower of Eugenio Siragusa.

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:39.750 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of these people,
when they're very young,

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:45.020 align:middle line:84%
they are followers of a leader,
a master, a guru-type person.

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:46.020 align:middle line:90%
Then they have contact--

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're in resonance
by the time they're very young.

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:48.435 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:48.435 --> 00:39:49.235 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:39:49.235 --> 00:39:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And so the same with
Ricardo Gonzalez--

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.220 align:middle line:90%
he was a follower of Sixto Paz.

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Enrique was a
follower of Sixto Paz.

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:58.080 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is they're
getting the information,

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.910 align:middle line:84%
and then they
themselves have contact.

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And in the case, and I should
go there, the case of Ricardo

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Gonzalez, I had physical contact
with a 10-foot tall being

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:09.090 align:middle line:90%
in Shasta because of him.

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:10.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
look at this picture.

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:12.066 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
this a little bit,

00:40:12.066 --> 00:40:14.490 align:middle line:84%
I think, when we did our last
show together, a year or two

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:15.470 align:middle line:90%
ago--

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:16.680 align:middle line:84%
right after it
happened, actually,

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.450 align:middle line:84%
because you were still a little
rattled by the whole thing.

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:19.574 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I'm very rattled.

00:40:19.574 --> 00:40:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I had post-traumatic--
I mean, you know,

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:23.016 align:middle line:84%
I can do these
stories, but then--

00:40:23.016 --> 00:40:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When it
happens to you,

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:25.410 align:middle line:90%
it's a whole different deal.

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: When it happens to
me, it's a clash of dimensions.

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:30.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a clash of
everything, I mean,

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.440 align:middle line:84%
everything you believed
in, everything you thought.

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:38.490 align:middle line:84%
But Ricardo had said that he
does program sightings, too.

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:43.153 align:middle line:84%
If the craft appears in Shasta
at 9:33, it's there at 9:33.

00:40:43.153 --> 00:40:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And they'll share
that information.

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.390 align:middle line:84%
I was out with Steven
Greer in the field,

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:50.280 align:middle line:84%
and they'll let you
know telepathically

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:51.739 align:middle line:84%
when they're coming
in and where.

00:40:51.739 --> 00:40:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I've been
with Steven, too.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.150 align:middle line:90%
He's amazing.

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:55.470 align:middle line:90%
He's one of the people--

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:58.430 align:middle line:84%
he, Grant Cameron, and
Colin Andrews, for me,

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:00.464 align:middle line:84%
are among the
greatest researchers

00:41:00.464 --> 00:41:02.880 align:middle line:84%
also, because they've shifted
the consciousness component.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Grant Cameron, yeah.

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:06.488 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: You know, they
went to consciousness.

00:41:06.488 --> 00:41:08.710 align:middle line:84%
They started in nuts and
bolts like me, and then--

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there's
a theme that keeps

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.370 align:middle line:90%
popping up here in your life.

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And that is that you're
drawn into these stories

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:16.140 align:middle line:90%
by way of trust.

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:18.060 align:middle line:84%
It's that people
know to bring you in.

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:19.560 align:middle line:90%
They know they can trust you.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And now let's go to Ricardo
and what happened with the man

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:26.050 align:middle line:90%
from Apu.

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:26.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:30.360 align:middle line:84%
When I did Ricardo's
story, he was in Mongolia.

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.710 align:middle line:90%
And he will be in Mongolia.

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:33.990 align:middle line:84%
We had talked about
that, this year, again.

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And he texted me and said,
Antarel wants to meet you.

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, no, this
is just another example

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.980 align:middle line:84%
of people who want publicity
and so forth and so on.

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Plus, I don't care for--

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.820 align:middle line:84%
there's no way that I
like to be uncomfortable.

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:49.180 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I'm not doing it.

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You
don't like to camp.

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:51.610 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to meet
any ETs personally.

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just want to
research them comfortably.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, I said,
no, this is not good for me.

00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:59.117 align:middle line:90%
I don't think I want to do this.

00:41:59.117 --> 00:42:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And then he went to Malaga
and texted me and said,

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.408 align:middle line:84%
we'll take care of everything,
but you must be there,

00:42:03.408 --> 00:42:04.960 align:middle line:90%
because you have an invitation.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.910 align:middle line:10%
Remember this-- when you
get an invitation, say yes.

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:09.810 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:13.035 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK, and I
didn't know what to expect.

00:42:13.035 --> 00:42:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And three days of camping in
this freezing cold weather,

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.540 align:middle line:90%
I was in a one-man tent.

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:21.000 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize that you
had to bring your food,

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.080 align:middle line:84%
so I had one apple
I cut in 16 pieces.

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.694 align:middle line:84%
I lasted for three
days with one apple.

00:42:26.694 --> 00:42:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And then I couldn't wait
to go home at the end of it

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:31.080 align:middle line:84%
even though it was
very beautiful.

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:34.020 align:middle line:90%
We did a lot of meditation.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:37.150 align:middle line:84%
We recited a lot of
om, a lot of mantras.

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:38.070 align:middle line:90%
It was very special.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:40.090 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You tell them to
create a nice high frequency,

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:40.355 align:middle line:10%
yeah.

00:42:40.355 --> 00:42:42.063 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, well
it's very important.

00:42:42.063 --> 00:42:45.450 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize how
important the frequency

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:48.120 align:middle line:90%
is for the coming of the craft.

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:49.890 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I didn't.

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:52.470 align:middle line:90%
I see the mechanics of it now.

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And you can't just go somewhere,
jump and yell and scream,

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and say, come, because
why would they?

00:42:58.170 --> 00:42:58.970 align:middle line:90%
Why would they?

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:00.678 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
sometimes they do anyway.

00:43:00.678 --> 00:43:02.600 align:middle line:84%
But you're making a
more favorable condition

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.070 align:middle line:90%
for a prearranged meeting.

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:07.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, because
they want to connect.

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:08.600 align:middle line:90%
And I don't think they connect--

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.270 align:middle line:84%
I think they connect
on another level,

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:14.750 align:middle line:84%
a very spiritual
level or whatever.

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:15.899 align:middle line:90%
They want to connect.

00:43:15.899 --> 00:43:17.440 align:middle line:84%
So in any case,
though, the last day,

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.920 align:middle line:84%
the Sunday, I
couldn't wait to eat.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.794 align:middle line:84%
And all I could think
about was tortilla soup

00:43:20.794 --> 00:43:22.270 align:middle line:90%
that they were making.

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:23.244 align:middle line:90%
And I could smell it.

00:43:23.244 --> 00:43:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was going, when's
this going to be over?

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And he came over and he
kneeled down, and he said,

00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:29.030 align:middle line:90%
Antarel is in the forest.

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:30.150 align:middle line:90%
Can you handle it?

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:33.520 align:middle line:90%
And of course, I said, yes.

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Here's where you say yes.

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:38.085 align:middle line:84%
And I did hold the hands of
two other women, Mercedes

00:43:38.085 --> 00:43:38.885 align:middle line:90%
and Siapa.

00:43:38.885 --> 00:43:40.130 align:middle line:90%
And we did go to the forest.

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's this 10-foot
tall man standing there

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:43.610 align:middle line:90%
against a tree.

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is this his face.

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:46.000 align:middle line:90%
We're looking at his face here.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:46.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
looking at the forest.

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And he has
these almond-shaped eyes

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:51.530 align:middle line:90%
and a long face.

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:54.050 align:middle line:84%
I had another encounter
with him the following year,

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:55.970 align:middle line:84%
so I saw the blonde
hair the following year.

00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:58.400 align:middle line:84%
But he was wearing a
hoodie the first time.

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And basically, he was
speaking in a language

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:04.280 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't understand, and
it sounded like a bullhorn.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And at the very end
of three minutes,

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:09.260 align:middle line:84%
there I am at three minutes,
looking at this guy,

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:11.840 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to do,
because there's no protocols.

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And just nobody told
you what you had to do.

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And he said, in a
robotic voice, thank you.

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Turns around and walks
back into the forest.

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:27.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, there were three
witnesses here--

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:30.080 align:middle line:84%
three that went down and
two that were there--

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.870 align:middle line:84%
my interpreter and
soul that were there.

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:36.680 align:middle line:90%
And we all saw him.

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what to tell
people, except that there

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.400 align:middle line:90%
was a reason for that.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.770 align:middle line:90%
It was an invitation.

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:44.620 align:middle line:90%
It was a thank you.

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think when things
like that happen,

00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:49.490 align:middle line:84%
there's a responsibility
to tell the world.

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:51.730 align:middle line:84%
The one thing I didn't
want to be known as

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:55.010 align:middle line:84%
is a contactee, because I'm
an investigative journalist,

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:57.500 align:middle line:90%
very nuts and bolts.

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.490 align:middle line:84%
But when I get told
by Maurizio Cavallo

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:04.950 align:middle line:84%
that the ETs already know that
I'm coming 10 years earlier,

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:06.920 align:middle line:84%
and that this is
all preprogrammed,

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:09.110 align:middle line:84%
then I begin to
question my life.

00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:10.910 align:middle line:90%
I say, well, who's doing this?

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:13.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, where is
this coming from?

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and I think
that you're always invited

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:18.800 align:middle line:90%
in because you're very sincere.

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.060 align:middle line:90%
You're without guile.

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:22.370 align:middle line:84%
You're not part of
the ego structure

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:24.500 align:middle line:84%
that's happening within
the ufology community.

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very strong,
male-dominated, egoic

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.329 align:middle line:84%
structure, which really has
kind of made me shy away

00:45:31.329 --> 00:45:33.620 align:middle line:84%
from a lot of it, because
now the stories are becoming,

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:35.780 align:middle line:84%
like I said, a little
more distorted.

00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:38.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more fear
being driven into the story.

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:40.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of where
I start to check out

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:41.210 align:middle line:90%
of the whole thing.

00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:44.000 align:middle line:84%
But with what you're doing,
I'm always interested,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.880 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
kind of faithful

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.040 align:middle line:90%
uplifting to the story.

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:49.850 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: There is.

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:54.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've had to really
change my mind so many times,

00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Regina, because
I'm very logical,

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:57.500 align:middle line:90%
and I'm very nuts and bolts.

00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.390 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I work with Hynek.

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:01.940 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he's a scientist.

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And for me to go this
road and to realize

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:10.340 align:middle line:84%
that all of these things that
are happening in this field

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:12.790 align:middle line:84%
are to bring us to a
higher consciousness--

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:13.950 align:middle line:90%
and you're already there.

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:19.390 align:middle line:84%
You were there years ago,
before I even touched this.

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And that this is the key to
the human race, is graduating--

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:29.030 align:middle line:84%
I call it graduating
to the next level.

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:31.570 align:middle line:90%
That when people understand--

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:33.150 align:middle line:84%
and this is why I
like Latin America.

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I'm
working right now.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.390 align:middle line:84%
So we had America
as one stage that

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:41.940 align:middle line:84%
was happening pretty
heavily in the 1950s-- '40s,

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.010 align:middle line:90%
'50s, and '60s.

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Right.

00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
there was a lot

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:49.170 align:middle line:84%
of activity in Europe and
Britain that was happening,

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:49.970 align:middle line:90%
Italy.

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Those communities,
not so much Britain,

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:56.600 align:middle line:84%
but Italy in particular,
really embraced the subject.

00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:59.960 align:middle line:84%
They had a great curiosity
and wanted to know more.

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, the
French, like 15 years ago,

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:06.755 align:middle line:84%
they started
releasing documents,

00:47:06.755 --> 00:47:07.630 align:middle line:90%
classified documents.

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:10.190 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: They also had contact
in that book, "'We Are Here!'

00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:11.600 align:middle line:10%
Visitors without Passports'"--

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.400 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.360 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: --talks about
the French contacts.

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:18.590 align:middle line:10%
And Michel, who is French--
he lives in Tokyo--

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:22.820 align:middle line:10%
talks about contact,
regular ETs look like us,

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:28.910 align:middle line:10%
being part of an
apartment condo in Paris,

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:31.520 align:middle line:10%
and the people seeing these
people walk back and forth.

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.740 align:middle line:84%
They were dressed a
little differently though.

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:36.620 align:middle line:84%
He talks-- I always notice the
fact he said in the summertime,

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:39.860 align:middle line:84%
they have these heavy
sweaters, and that you

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:43.020 align:middle line:84%
could tell by their face
and their clear blue eyes.

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah,
that their eyes are

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:49.040 align:middle line:84%
one of the ways you can
tell that this person is not

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.157 align:middle line:90%
from here.

00:47:50.157 --> 00:47:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
interestingly, you

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:56.390 align:middle line:84%
go to Britain and you go to
Germany, not so forthcoming.

00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:59.240 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when
you hop over to Russia?

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:01.970 align:middle line:84%
The Russian people, prior
to the Russian Revolution

00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:05.180 align:middle line:84%
in particular, these
were very spiritually

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:10.240 align:middle line:84%
open people that were aligned
toward accepting phenomena

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:12.850 align:middle line:84%
and a really deep kind
of spirit in that way.

00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:15.650 align:middle line:84%
So the Russians even took
more of this information

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:16.619 align:middle line:90%
to heart than we did.

00:48:16.619 --> 00:48:17.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, for them, also it's a
matter of national security.

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:21.988 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So that
card, you can use

00:48:21.988 --> 00:48:26.150 align:middle line:84%
that to say UFOs
are real, that it's

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:28.340 align:middle line:84%
important because of matters
of national security--

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:29.820 align:middle line:90%
opens all the doors.

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:31.160 align:middle line:90%
They don't care who's inside.

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:33.140 align:middle line:90%
They care about two things--

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:37.259 align:middle line:84%
national security and let's
copy the propulsion system.

00:48:37.259 --> 00:48:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:39.770 align:middle line:90%
So it's a practical reason.

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And then you jump over to
Asia over the last decade

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:45.110 align:middle line:84%
and a half, two decades, and
you have an increased interest

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:46.770 align:middle line:90%
on TV shows and all of that.

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:47.570 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:49.220 align:middle line:84%
That's becoming a
little more open.

00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Even China's becoming more
open because of incidents

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:53.230 align:middle line:84%
over the last few years
that you couldn't ignore.

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh yeah.

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:55.675 align:middle line:84%
They shut down the
Beijing airport 10 times,

00:48:55.675 --> 00:48:57.420 align:middle line:90%
and they say it's UFOs.

00:48:57.420 --> 00:48:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:01.550 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: We had one
incident in Chicago,

00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:04.377 align:middle line:10%
and we're still not
talking about it.

00:49:04.377 --> 00:49:06.210 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You know,
it's really interesting.

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:08.043 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this country
is supposed to be known

00:49:08.043 --> 00:49:10.100 align:middle line:10%
for our freedom of speech.

00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:12.440 align:middle line:10%
And interestingly,
is probably the most

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:16.070 align:middle line:10%
suppressed in terms of any kind
of alternative information,

00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:20.210 align:middle line:10%
to say nothing of
ufology and that field.

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, I'm convinced
it's just not a priority.

00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:26.815 align:middle line:10%
I mean, even the disclosure
that happened right now,

00:49:26.815 --> 00:49:29.270 align:middle line:10%
and thank god for the
disclosure that happened right

00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:32.120 align:middle line:10%
now in the "New York
Times," but to me, that's

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:33.500 align:middle line:10%
still about hardware.

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:34.940 align:middle line:90%
That isn't about who's inside.

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:37.420 align:middle line:84%
But it made me legitimate
with my own children.

00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:40.027 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: After so
many years, and, Mom,

00:49:40.027 --> 00:49:42.110 align:middle line:84%
there's something to what
you're doing, because it

00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:43.354 align:middle line:90%
was in the "New York Times."

00:49:43.354 --> 00:49:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I remember
when that came out,

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:47.910 align:middle line:84%
around Christmas time, it
was on a Sunday morning.

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:49.160 align:middle line:90%
No one's paying any attention.

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.110 align:middle line:84%
I remember I picked
it up and thought,

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:52.880 align:middle line:90%
it's happening, finally.

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Posted it to Facebook,
and then pretty soon,

00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:58.820 align:middle line:84%
within 24, 48 hours, it
started making its way around.

00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:01.490 align:middle line:84%
And that was really one of
the first times in the US

00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:04.010 align:middle line:84%
that something was just
offered up for what it is.

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And it offered faces we know,
like from Senator Harry Reid.

00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, people
who were actually

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:14.580 align:middle line:84%
looking into research about
this phenomena and admitted it.

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And I remember Harry Reid
said in that article,

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:19.580 align:middle line:84%
he said, that's
probably the thing I'm

00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:21.710 align:middle line:84%
most proud of in
my entire career,

00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:23.930 align:middle line:84%
is that I actually got to
be part of this, trying

00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:26.660 align:middle line:84%
to figure out who
these other beings are

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:28.350 align:middle line:90%
and what they're doing here.

00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:30.440 align:middle line:90%
And that happened.

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.159 align:middle line:84%
That little nugget
just happened.

00:50:32.159 --> 00:50:34.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering what else is
going to come down the line.

00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Because right now
it's cooled off considerably.

00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:38.866 align:middle line:90%
But you know--

00:50:38.866 --> 00:50:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For one
moment, it was there.

00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: For one
moment, we were credible.

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:43.400 align:middle line:90%
We weren't crazy.

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:46.100 align:middle line:84%
So I bring that up because
I'm kind of hopscotching

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.600 align:middle line:90%
around the globe a bit.

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:51.230 align:middle line:84%
You don't hear a whole
lot about Africa other

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:56.900 align:middle line:84%
than the ancestral, passed-down
legends of the visitors.

00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:58.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Except, and I
did bring some images--

00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, did you?

00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:02.736 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --of Elizabeth
Klarer's story,

00:51:02.736 --> 00:51:03.860 align:middle line:90%
"Beyond the Light Barrier."

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.200 align:middle line:90%
And she lived in South Africa.

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: South Africa that
was British colonial dominated

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:09.290 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:11.360 align:middle line:84%
She was awarded by the
British government.

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And she had not only a
relationship with this man, she

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.409 align:middle line:90%
had a child by him.

00:51:17.409 --> 00:51:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: By one of the others?

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:20.560 align:middle line:90%
But it was a man.

00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, a man man.

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That works.

00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:23.900 align:middle line:90%
It still works.

00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:25.865 align:middle line:84%
And it worked early
on in this planet.

00:51:25.865 --> 00:51:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I think so.

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On this planet,
there was that kind of--

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:32.840 align:middle line:84%
I do believe there was
that kind of intermixing

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:35.210 align:middle line:84%
that was going on very
early on, because this

00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:36.980 align:middle line:90%
was kind of a melting pot.

00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:38.824 align:middle line:84%
We call America a
melting pot today,

00:51:38.824 --> 00:51:40.490 align:middle line:84%
but wow, I think what
was happening back

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:44.570 align:middle line:84%
in the truly ancient times was
even more interesting, in terms

00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:46.030 align:middle line:90%
of genetics and mixing blood.

00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:47.488 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
yeah, the ancient--

00:51:47.488 --> 00:51:48.770 align:middle line:90%
all that is real.

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:52.170 align:middle line:84%
I can't do that, because
that isn't my expertise,

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:53.090 align:middle line:90%
so I don't jump there.

00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:53.890 --> 00:51:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: But for
instance, there

00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:02.660 align:middle line:84%
were giants on the island of
Sardinia, 15-foot tall people.

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I saw the tombs, and
they have the bones.

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in the American
Southwest, the same thing.

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Photos have been taken of
these beings, these people.

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:15.590 align:middle line:90%
And even in Ohio.

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:17.430 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's all over the world.

00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:18.620 align:middle line:90%
It's in Colombia.

00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:19.512 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:52:19.512 --> 00:52:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: If we could
get archaeologists,

00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:25.040 align:middle line:84%
if we could get scientists,
if we could get proper people

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:27.620 align:middle line:84%
to discuss this in
a scholarly manner,

00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:29.930 align:middle line:84%
we would not be
considered crazy.

00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:31.490 align:middle line:90%
This would be a study.

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is probably
the goal of my life,

00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:35.990 align:middle line:90%
to make this a serious study.

00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Stop playing around
with these silliness,

00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:45.710 align:middle line:84%
putting on t-shirts and these
tinfoil hats and having these

00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:47.170 align:middle line:90%
statues of Grey--

00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:49.520 align:middle line:84%
to me, that doesn't
make it a study.

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:50.742 align:middle line:90%
I really think that--

00:52:50.742 --> 00:52:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It makes
it a phenomenon.

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:52.420 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It makes
it entertainment.

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.169 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, entertainment.

00:52:55.169 --> 00:52:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Let's go have
some fun with our friends.

00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:01.740 align:middle line:84%
I really would love to hear
what the anthropologists think.

00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:05.040 align:middle line:84%
I would really love to hear
what everybody else thinks

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.249 align:middle line:90%
in these different countries.

00:53:06.249 --> 00:53:07.048 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:07.048 --> 00:53:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is where Klaus
Dona and his work--

00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Austrian man, Klaus
Dona-- comes in.

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:11.580 align:middle line:90%
I know him very well.

00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:12.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:13.214 align:middle line:90%
And he has his book.

00:53:13.214 --> 00:53:14.463 align:middle line:90%
I've forgotten the name of it.

00:53:14.463 --> 00:53:16.290 align:middle line:10%
It's sitting on my
bookshelf, but if you

00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:18.120 align:middle line:10%
look under the name Klaus Dona.

00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.590 align:middle line:10%
Some amazing
artifacts that he-- he

00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:23.250 align:middle line:10%
was an art curator
and museum curator.

00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And he started running
into this phenomena,

00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:27.960 align:middle line:84%
and has an incredible
collection of things that

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.550 align:middle line:90%
really shouldn't be on Earth.

00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And he's taken them
to universities.

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:32.790 align:middle line:90%
He's had them studied.

00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:36.990 align:middle line:84%
He's had pieces of beings
that are 23-, 24-feet tall,

00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:39.670 align:middle line:84%
studied by universities,
saying, yeah,

00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:41.900 align:middle line:90%
that appears to be a human--

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:44.310 align:middle line:84%
and one piece I held
was an occipital bone--

00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:47.920 align:middle line:84%
a human occipital bone, except
this is a very tall person.

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:48.720 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And so he is doing
his due diligence.

00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And there are others who
are doing this as well.

00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Erich von Daniken,
Klaus Dona-- there are people.

00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:01.320 align:middle line:84%
But it goes contrary to the
traditional anthropology.

00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it does.

00:54:02.290 --> 00:54:03.623 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: And this is a problem.

00:54:03.623 --> 00:54:04.740 align:middle line:90%
So what would happen?

00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And even the UFO phenomenon
and these beings being here

00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:09.720 align:middle line:90%
goes contrary to our history.

00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.980 align:middle line:84%
So everything would
have to be changed.

00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, it's inevitable.

00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:14.290 align:middle line:90%
So, OK.

00:54:14.290 --> 00:54:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have another
photo of this--

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:16.800 align:middle line:90%
Kinyo?

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:17.360 align:middle line:90%
Is that his name?

00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Kenyo.

00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kenyo.

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:20.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: This is
the Amicizia case.

00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:21.840 align:middle line:10%
And this is the last
interview that I

00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:24.960 align:middle line:10%
did in Europe that was amazing,
with Gaspare de Lama at Lake

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:25.800 align:middle line:10%
Como.

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:31.200 align:middle line:10%
In 1956, a group of
beings that didn't say

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.630 align:middle line:10%
where they came from
bonded with a group

00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:37.200 align:middle line:10%
of 10 Italians in Pescara
in the Adriatic Coast.

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.300 align:middle line:10%
And they had a relationship
with these beings.

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:41.040 align:middle line:10%
And Kenyo was 10-foot tall.

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:43.170 align:middle line:10%
Some of the beings were small.

00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:45.960 align:middle line:84%
This is another
federation situation.

00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is called the
friendship case, the Amicizia

00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:49.230 align:middle line:90%
case.

00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this tall man
that's wearing a Hawaiian

00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:52.280 align:middle line:90%
shirt--

00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And Kenyo,
with curly hair, Kenyo.

00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And John Pedro-- and I've
heard his audio tapes,

00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:01.740 align:middle line:84%
because these beings would
speak on crystal radio,

00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:05.700 align:middle line:84%
or they would contact
the Italians that way--

00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.080 align:middle line:90%
spoke Italian.

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:08.730 align:middle line:90%
And they would meet.

00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And they said to the 10
Italians that they chose,

00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:15.180 align:middle line:84%
this is an experiment
with friendship.

00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:18.900 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, we have
this technology called Ureida,

00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:19.971 align:middle line:90%
which is called harmony.

00:55:19.971 --> 00:55:21.470 align:middle line:84%
You can call it
love if you want to.

00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:24.030 align:middle line:84%
If you start arguing
among yourselves

00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:27.160 align:middle line:84%
and there's disharmony
in you and your group,

00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:28.950 align:middle line:90%
we need to go home.

00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And so to me, that was very
interesting, because they have,

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:37.306 align:middle line:84%
with their technology, they've
advanced their spirituality.

00:55:37.306 --> 00:55:39.930 align:middle line:84%
If they've got this technology--
and they called it technology,

00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:42.480 align:middle line:84%
called Ureida which
means harmony--

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:44.402 align:middle line:84%
and then they can't
live among the Italians

00:55:44.402 --> 00:55:46.110 align:middle line:84%
because they're arguing
with each other--

00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:47.068 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All the time.

00:55:47.068 --> 00:55:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And I asked Gaspare,
I said, what

00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:54.810 align:middle line:84%
was the main purpose
of their being here?

00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, it's time
to end the separation.

00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:00.250 align:middle line:84%
He said, humanity
needs to come together.

00:56:00.250 --> 00:56:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how long did
this experiment last?

00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:04.230 align:middle line:90%
And he said 10 years.

00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And he said then
everybody got jealous,

00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:09.360 align:middle line:84%
because some people saw them,
some people talked to them,

00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:10.740 align:middle line:90%
and the other people didn't.

00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And he said they started
arguing among themselves

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:15.090 align:middle line:90%
and the experiment ended.

00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:16.710 align:middle line:90%
And I said, isn't that sad?

00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:17.630 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that sad?

00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:20.010 align:middle line:90%
I said, you people--

00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:23.492 align:middle line:84%
he and his wife were
part of that 10 group.

00:56:23.492 --> 00:56:25.200 align:middle line:84%
By the way, these
beings were vegetarian.

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:27.310 align:middle line:90%
I have to tell you.

00:56:27.310 --> 00:56:28.710 align:middle line:90%
They had a way of living.

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And in Howard Menger's book,
the last 30 pages in the book

00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:35.160 align:middle line:84%
were how to keep
your blood alkaline,

00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:38.440 align:middle line:84%
because most of the diseases
are caused by acidity.

00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:39.240 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:41.070 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: And I think
there's even pictures

00:56:41.070 --> 00:56:43.680 align:middle line:10%
that I brought of the
fruits and vegetables

00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:46.020 align:middle line:10%
these Venusians gave to Howard.

00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:50.460 align:middle line:10%
And I have photographs of the
laboratories he sent them in

00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:51.930 align:middle line:10%
to be analyzed in New Jersey.

00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:53.221 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And what did it show?

00:56:53.221 --> 00:56:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It showed-- well,
I don't have the results.

00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:58.050 align:middle line:84%
I have the envelopes
that Howard put them in.

00:56:58.050 --> 00:56:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: But the book,
"From Outer Space to You,"

00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:06.660 align:middle line:84%
the last 30 pages is, look,
they want us to live longer,

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:10.860 align:middle line:84%
because right now, our
diets, the way we live,

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.490 align:middle line:90%
the stress level--

00:57:12.490 --> 00:57:14.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we shouldn't
be living to only 100.

00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The Clarion
people were 700 years old.

00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:21.252 align:middle line:84%
The Venusians said that
they were 600 years old.

00:57:21.252 --> 00:57:23.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we used to
be, once upon a time, too.

00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:25.590 align:middle line:84%
So we have, now, a
shortened lifespan.

00:57:25.590 --> 00:57:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Like I said earlier, it's
really about just remembering.

00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And that means
remembering all of it,

00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:33.600 align:middle line:84%
remembering the kind of
thoughts that are beneficial

00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:36.450 align:middle line:84%
and expansive to us,
the ability to connect

00:57:36.450 --> 00:57:38.790 align:middle line:84%
beyond the physical
and time and space,

00:57:38.790 --> 00:57:40.050 align:middle line:90%
the way to feed the body.

00:57:40.050 --> 00:57:42.040 align:middle line:84%
All of this just has
to be remembered.

00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:43.230 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:57:43.230 --> 00:57:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're on
our way there, I think.

00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:45.888 align:middle line:90%
We're on our way there.

00:57:45.888 --> 00:57:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think that one of
the things-- and Ricardo

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.980 align:middle line:84%
tells me this, too,
and so did Sixto.

00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:53.980 align:middle line:84%
You have to quiet
the mind so that you

00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:57.550 align:middle line:84%
leave space for those
people to talk to you,

00:57:57.550 --> 00:57:59.250 align:middle line:84%
because they will
give you the download.

00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:01.400 align:middle line:84%
But you can't do it
in a frenetic society.

00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:04.090 align:middle line:84%
You can't do it with
negativity around you.

00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And meditation is
very, very important.

00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:09.200 align:middle line:84%
That's not something
I do though.

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:10.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Quieting?

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't
quiet the mind.

00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:12.250 align:middle line:90%
You're busy, busy.

00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: I know.

00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And the last message
I got from Antarel--

00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:17.740 align:middle line:90%
and it was really funny.

00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:19.670 align:middle line:84%
I went back to Shasta
last year, and I said,

00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:21.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going back
in that forest.

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I was with Ricardo, and
he said, Paola, he said, here,

00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:27.950 align:middle line:84%
use a handwritten
note in pencil.

00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Antarel-- this woman, Dr.
Rachel Smith, has a note for you

00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:35.750 align:middle line:90%
from Antarel.

00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't know I was
there, and she had never met me.

00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:42.940 align:middle line:84%
But Antarel got to her and
said, tell Paola Harris

00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:46.780 align:middle line:84%
that she's going to have
to start meditating,

00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:49.630 align:middle line:90%
because she can develop her ESP.

00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And tell Paola
Harris that we will

00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:56.150 align:middle line:84%
try to speak through her,
which is really interesting.

00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And then he put, and
there will be an article

00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.336 align:middle line:90%
that will come out this year.

00:59:00.336 --> 00:59:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, girl,
start meditating,

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:03.850 align:middle line:90%
because I know you pretty well.

00:59:03.850 --> 00:59:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And you are natively
quite intuitive.

00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:07.630 align:middle line:84%
You just don't even
think about it.

00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:09.160 align:middle line:90%
You don't give yourself credit.

00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So why don't you listen
to the 10-foot tall man

00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:14.020 align:middle line:90%
with the hoodie on?

00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:16.766 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: Well, you
know, I always want to.

00:59:16.766 --> 00:59:18.012 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:18.012 --> 00:59:19.220 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And then you don't.

00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:20.860 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: And then there's
10 things that come up during

00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:21.970 align:middle line:10%
the day that I don't get--

00:59:21.970 --> 00:59:24.700 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, so don't start
texting at 7:00 in the morning.

00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:25.500 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:27.334 align:middle line:84%
Put the phone away until
after you meditate.

00:59:27.334 --> 00:59:28.133 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:59:28.133 --> 00:59:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I will make
a concentrated effort.

00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:33.220 align:middle line:10%
I can't tell people to do that
and then not do it myself.

00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:37.300 align:middle line:10%
So yeah, basically when I say
that if you quiet the mind,

00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:41.250 align:middle line:10%
you can get all messages
from all of these people,

00:59:41.250 --> 00:59:44.591 align:middle line:10%
then if I don't do it, I
don't practice what I preach.

00:59:44.591 --> 00:59:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so that's the
next level of your career.

00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:47.470 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: OK.

00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:48.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Promise?

00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:49.693 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Promise.

00:59:49.693 --> 00:59:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because I want to
hear what messages come through.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.120 align:middle line:90%
Paola, thank you so much.

00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:55.600 align:middle line:84%
It's always just absolutely
delightful being with you.

00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:57.610 align:middle line:90%
And the time rips by.

00:59:57.610 --> 00:59:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for sharing
these amazing photos with us.

00:59:59.950 --> 01:00:01.158 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, you're welcome.

01:00:01.158 --> 01:00:02.687 align:middle line:90%
I enjoyed it.

01:00:02.687 --> 01:00:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, you
can find out more

01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:06.600 align:middle line:84%
about Paola's conferences,
books, field trips,

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.350 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, by going
to paolaharris.com.

She's a good one to be
connected with if you want

01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:12.944 align:middle line:10%
to dive deep into exopolitics.

01:00:12.944 --> 01:00:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here
