00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: One of the
most speculated about subjects

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.040 align:middle line:84%
in modern Western history
has been whether or not

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.320 align:middle line:84%
humans live more
than one lifetime.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.120 align:middle line:10%
In the East, however,
reincarnation

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.160 align:middle line:10%
is an accepted
phenomenon that is

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:10%
at the basis of many of the
world's oldest religions.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.380 align:middle line:10%
Since the West worships
science, it takes a scientist

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.060 align:middle line:10%
to serve as a cultural
shaman in the understanding

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.960 align:middle line:10%
of this esoteric subject,
and Paul Van Ward

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.690 align:middle line:10%
has put his Harvard
degree to use

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.950 align:middle line:10%
to provide us with a
scientific framework

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.850 align:middle line:10%
for understanding reincarnation
in his book The Soul Genome.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.610 align:middle line:90%
And he joins us today.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.400 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Paul.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.024 align:middle line:90%
I love your jacket.

00:00:51.024 --> 00:00:51.800 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.300 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL VON WARD: Thank you.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm delighted to be here.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who knows where
you were in another lifetime,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.580 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: That's
right, this is royalty.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Flamboyant.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.050 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I really
like about your book,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.474 align:middle line:84%
you go into a lot
of the science.

00:01:02.474 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to get into
some of the science of it

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.810 align:middle line:84%
today because I
think it's important.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And you've spent many, many
years delving into this.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.110 align:middle line:84%
But I also would like to
spend some time getting

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:90%
into the examples.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And there is this
five factor evaluation

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.800 align:middle line:84%
that you take into
consideration.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.220 align:middle line:84%
We'll get to that a little
bit later in the interview

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.770 align:middle line:84%
with some really
tantalizing comparison

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.354 align:middle line:84%
photographs including
Marilyn Monroe.

00:01:27.354 --> 00:01:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Yes.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.478 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a
more recent version

00:01:29.478 --> 00:01:33.500 align:middle line:84%
of Marilyn Monroe, Gurdjieff
the mystic, and others.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.767 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted
to let people know

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:37.350 align:middle line:84%
that even though we
can't start there,

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.310 align:middle line:90%
we're going to end up there.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.476 align:middle line:90%
And you've got to see these.

00:01:39.476 --> 00:01:40.620 align:middle line:90%
It's really mind blowing.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.420 align:middle line:84%
But first of all,
let's talk about you

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.530 align:middle line:84%
because you didn't
come by this naturally.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Nope, I didn't.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Baptist
minister, I mean, heavily

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.350 align:middle line:84%
into the academic world
in your own studies.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Degree in Psychology from
Harvard, Naval officer, hello?

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.270 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing in
here that speaks

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.190 align:middle line:84%
to writing books
on reincarnation

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.130 align:middle line:90%
so tell us your story.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Well, you know,
I was born down in Florida

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.030 align:middle line:84%
on a sharecropper's farm in the
end years of the Depression.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.820 align:middle line:10%
But here we are today, 70 years
plus later, and there we are.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.920 align:middle line:10%
I started out, really, in
a traditional sort of way,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.770 align:middle line:10%
you know, responding
to the culture

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.390 align:middle line:10%
that I grew up in: the Southern
Baptist fundamentalist culture,

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.590 align:middle line:10%
university environment,
and following patrons.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, going
into the Navy, going

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.050 align:middle line:84%
to the diplomatic
service, following

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.490 align:middle line:90%
the paths of older people.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.680 align:middle line:84%
But I think what happened, I
was working on my first effort

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.560 align:middle line:84%
at a degree in Clinical
Psychology at Florida State

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.610 align:middle line:84%
University, and I
was also part time

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.690 align:middle line:84%
the minister for
the local church.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And Paul Tillich came, the great
theologian of the 20th century,

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.150 align:middle line:84%
and we started
talking about God.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And I was a Southern
Baptist minister,

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.420 align:middle line:84%
you know, and had a very
narrow specific idea of God.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And he had talked about
some expansive idea

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.700 align:middle line:90%
and I said, how can you do that?

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.170 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, it's a matter
of how you define God.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, we had a little exchange
and it just opened my eyes up

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and I started moving out
of that traditional culture

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.590 align:middle line:90%
that I was in.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And also, at the same
time, in clinical classes

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.700 align:middle line:84%
and psychological
developmental classes,

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.580 align:middle line:84%
you know, I started
very much interested

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.227 align:middle line:84%
in Carl Jung, rather
than the other folks

00:03:37.227 --> 00:03:38.310 align:middle line:90%
that I should be studying.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.976 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:38.976 --> 00:03:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: And so I
realized at that time

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.400 align:middle line:90%
I was really on the wrong track.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.775 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I joined
the Navy to see the world

00:03:45.775 --> 00:03:48.170 align:middle line:84%
and went to officer
candidate school

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.701 align:middle line:84%
just in time for the Cuban
Missile Crisis, and Vietnam,

00:03:52.701 --> 00:03:53.200 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.400 align:middle line:84%
But fortunately, I was picked
up as a diplomat foreign service

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.670 align:middle line:90%
officer for a 15 year career.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.210 align:middle line:84%
But I got tired of
bureaucracy because I

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.960 align:middle line:84%
wanted to change
things and I was always

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:90%
looking at underlying questions.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And why shouldn't we do
it this way and that way.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Asking
too many questions.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.690 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Asking
too many questions.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, the
State Department

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.075 align:middle line:84%
paid for me to go
to spend a year up

00:04:15.075 --> 00:04:18.480 align:middle line:84%
at Harvard studying these sort
of psychological questions

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.100 align:middle line:84%
of organizations
and how societies

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.660 align:middle line:84%
work and all of
that sort of thing.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.020 align:middle line:84%
That would be
appropriate for what

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.860 align:middle line:84%
I thought my work in
the diplomatic service

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.640 align:middle line:90%
might involve.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And when I made
some recommendations

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.360 align:middle line:84%
to make the Department
of State run better,

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Henry Kissinger and
people like that--

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're always
open to suggestions, right?

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: I've realized after
running into that obstacle

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.720 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't have a real
creative future in the State

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Department, so I left and
started this track, really.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.680 align:middle line:84%
I founded and ran an
international nonprofit

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.940 align:middle line:84%
for about 15 years to get the
kids through school and college

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:00.910 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.884 align:middle line:84%
And work on Soviet-American
citizen exchanges

00:05:05.884 --> 00:05:06.550 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.770 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: It was
very worthwhile work.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.940 align:middle line:84%
But all the time, I was
thinking about these paranormal

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.000 align:middle line:84%
psychological consciousness
questions and issues,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.590 align:middle line:84%
and began to delve
into regressions

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.390 align:middle line:84%
and learned to do that for
myself, and work with others.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And I began to just discover
a totally different world.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And met Ian Stevenson
at a conference

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.670 align:middle line:84%
where we were talking
and, of course,

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.040 align:middle line:84%
he was the most eminent
scientific person

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.846 align:middle line:90%
to even deal with this issue.

00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With past lives
in children in particular

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Past
lives in children.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: And his
focus was on memories

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.790 align:middle line:84%
that survived death and
continued to be alive,

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.990 align:middle line:90%
and the children who had them.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And that was a
foundational area of work.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.200 align:middle line:84%
But my interest was in
developmental psychology.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.401 align:middle line:90%
Where do we go?

00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:10.900 align:middle line:90%
From--

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How do we
become what we are?

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: How do we become
what we are and-- so my focus

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.710 align:middle line:84%
on reincarnation
research several years

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.420 align:middle line:84%
later, after having talked
with him about his work

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.060 align:middle line:84%
and getting more
interested in it myself,

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.770 align:middle line:84%
I looked at stories
from different people.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:37.730 align:middle line:84%
About who seemed to have same
physical features, people

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:90%
who had--

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Same physical
features as what?

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Well, all
physical features.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.340 align:middle line:90%
But the primary areas--

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.739 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I'm asking
in comparison to what?

00:06:51.739 --> 00:06:53.280 align:middle line:84%
They had the same
physical features--

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.575 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:06:53.575 --> 00:06:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --in
comparison to what?

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.110 align:middle line:90%
Just for the context.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Right.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:56.712 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:56.712 --> 00:06:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: I just jumped
with that assumption.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about
comparing the features

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.040 align:middle line:84%
of a person alive
today with any images

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.337 align:middle line:84%
we have of the alleged
previous lifetime.

00:07:08.337 --> 00:07:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And was that kind
of an original hook for you?

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.790 align:middle line:90%
Was just these observations?

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: No.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Actually, Ian Stevenson
found in some of his cases

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.167 align:middle line:90%
this sort of correspondence.

00:07:20.167 --> 00:07:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.760 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: And Walter Semkiw
who was following somewhat

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.550 align:middle line:84%
in the shoes of Ian
Stevens, as well,

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:35.060 align:middle line:84%
saw likenesses that he
would compare cases with.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:39.590 align:middle line:84%
So what I did to take that
sort of scientific step

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:44.700 align:middle line:84%
to the next level was to
use biometric dimensions,

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.484 align:middle line:84%
technology, we use
cameras now and--

00:07:48.484 --> 00:07:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah,
iris scans, all of it

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.650 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Computers to
measure all of this stuff.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Iris scans is another
question because iris scans

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.810 align:middle line:84%
seem to be a very idiosyncratic
part of our anatomy.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:03.415 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:03.415 --> 00:08:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: But our facial
architecture, our genotypes

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:10.920 align:middle line:84%
and so on seem to be part of
this reincarnation process.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.730 align:middle line:84%
So what I did was
to take a more,

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.660 align:middle line:84%
I say this is a self-serving
way, but a more systematic,

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:24.090 align:middle line:84%
more quantitative approach than
Ian Stevenson or Walter Semkiw,

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.750 align:middle line:90%
or Adrian Finkelstein.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.410 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about
one of his cases.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Which we took
to another level with him

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.000 align:middle line:90%
in my collaboration with Adrian.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.549 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:36.600 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: So that was my--
and that came out of work

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:84%
I did at Harvard with
David McClelland who

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:44.540 align:middle line:84%
was a social psychologist,
but we had worked together

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:50.470 align:middle line:84%
on his theory of how you infer
personality traits, how you

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:54.650 align:middle line:84%
infer the underlying
personalities of people

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:58.090 align:middle line:84%
from their written word,
from their spoken words.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:02.530 align:middle line:84%
So that led me to take
this developmental model

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:04.201 align:middle line:84%
that I call the
Five Factor Model.

00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To give
it this framework.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things you
were personally intrigued with

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.810 align:middle line:90%
was the notion of prodigies.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:16.440 align:middle line:84%
How does someone come along that
can essentially compose music

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.490 align:middle line:84%
by the age of four when
their fingers can't even

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.670 align:middle line:84%
reach the keys yet and
they've had no training?

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.450 align:middle line:84%
Who can speak multiple
languages and so forth.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And one example-- we'll just
give a little one right upfront

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.280 align:middle line:90%
here-- was that of Paul Gauguin.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And what is believed to be his
more recent incarnation, which

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.665 align:middle line:84%
is, what is
Teekamp's first name?

00:09:35.665 --> 00:09:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: It's Peter Teekamp.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Peter Teekamp.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.690 align:middle line:10%
And let's take a look at that.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.100 align:middle line:10%
We see the two people.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.330 align:middle line:10%
Now this was Gauguin.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:43.913 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: Well,
this is Paul Gauguin

00:09:43.913 --> 00:09:46.170 align:middle line:10%
and his wife, Motte Gauguin.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:53.694 align:middle line:10%
And they were, of course,
known as a couple.

00:09:53.694 --> 00:09:54.360 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.860 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: Since
they were married.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.910 align:middle line:10%
But he, of course,
left her very early on

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.640 align:middle line:10%
and went on a wanderlust
kind of sort of life.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.806 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, he had a
wild kind of streak in him.

00:10:02.806 --> 00:10:04.882 align:middle line:10%
And let's look at
the next image now.

00:10:04.882 --> 00:10:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, here, let's
look at this one.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.900 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the one
of the two side by side,

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.820 align:middle line:84%
but this one is really, to
me, one of my favorite images

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:12.320 align:middle line:90%
you have.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.486 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Well, this is
very interesting because--

00:10:14.486 --> 00:10:20.410 align:middle line:84%
and I have to make it clear that
Peter Teekamp and his partner,

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:24.510 align:middle line:84%
they're not married, but
Michelle Moshier actually

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.590 align:middle line:90%
did this research on their own.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.230 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do it.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Stevenson or Semkiw
or no one else did.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:84%
All of us have looked
at it, obviously,

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.180 align:middle line:90%
to demonstrate it as a case.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.890 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And what
we're looking at here,

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.950 align:middle line:10%
the research is, we're looking
at the work on the left hand

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.734 align:middle line:10%
side, Gauguin, which
has age groups on it,

00:10:43.734 --> 00:10:45.150 align:middle line:10%
and then we're
looking at the work

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.632 align:middle line:10%
on the right which is Teekamp.

00:10:46.632 --> 00:10:47.340 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: Yeah.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.714 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Now
Teekamp was already

00:10:48.714 --> 00:10:51.250 align:middle line:10%
recognized for his artistic
abilities by the age of five.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.780 align:middle line:10%
It took Gauguin considerably
longer to become recognized.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:54.053 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: Oh yes.

00:10:54.053 --> 00:10:54.552 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:10:54.552 --> 00:10:58.250 align:middle line:10%
Teekamp sort of made
friends in this school

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:01.000 align:middle line:10%
because he could draw
the classmates' face.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.450 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But look at
the subject matters.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.530 align:middle line:10%
Teekamp did not know
of Gauguin's work

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:06.959 align:middle line:10%
and the correlation
between them.

00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:08.250 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: No, he had no idea.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:09.185 align:middle line:10%
He never had even heard of him.

00:11:09.185 --> 00:11:10.576 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But they're
doing the same subjects.

00:11:10.576 --> 00:11:11.867 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: Had no sense of it.

00:11:11.867 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's not so much
in these comparisons, not

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.080 align:middle line:10%
the artistic skill itself.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.335 align:middle line:10%
It is actually--

00:11:19.335 --> 00:11:19.830 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It's the subject.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:20.530 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: --the
subject matter.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:21.863 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It's a subject matter.

00:11:21.863 --> 00:11:24.470 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: And so
here he is painting

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:31.010 align:middle line:10%
100 years later similar
subjects at an earlier age.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:35.130 align:middle line:10%
And this is what we use
as an example of, sort of,

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.265 align:middle line:10%
the evolutionary process.

00:11:36.265 --> 00:11:41.770 align:middle line:10%
Because it took-- Because
Gauguin, of course,

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:45.650 align:middle line:10%
didn't start his art until
he was in his mid 20s.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And so here we have a
case where he's just

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.490 align:middle line:84%
doing it automatically
from the beginning.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And we see this in
music, mathematics, art,

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.780 align:middle line:90%
in Tiger Woods, and golf.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes!

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:04.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: So all of
these precocities--

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I like to use the word precocity
because all people have

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.200 align:middle line:84%
precocity in one
area or the other.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
explanation for it.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Noam Chomsky talked
about language

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:24.220 align:middle line:84%
even that we come already with
the structures of our language

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.034 align:middle line:90%
in--

00:12:25.034 --> 00:12:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Yes.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: --our inheritance.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: So this inheritance.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.150 align:middle line:90%
Where does it come from?

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:35.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that's
developed in accord

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.200 align:middle line:84%
with a model that
psychologists use today.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.640 align:middle line:84%
You learn it from
the environment,

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.099 align:middle line:84%
you get reinforcement,
all of that.

00:12:41.099 --> 00:12:42.515 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No because
in that case,

00:12:42.515 --> 00:12:44.880 align:middle line:84%
you would see within families
very similar personality

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.002 align:middle line:84%
traits, behaviors,
propensities, and precocities.

00:12:47.002 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Absolutely.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
don't see that.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.209 align:middle line:84%
We're each very
individual regardless--

00:12:51.209 --> 00:12:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Regardless
of the family.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --of that
nature nurture part.

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Some of them
are in the same family.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:57.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean musicians in the
same family and so on.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:02.424 align:middle line:84%
But those are just
exceptions, you know?

00:13:02.424 --> 00:13:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:04.548 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Because
most people are

00:13:04.548 --> 00:13:07.532 align:middle line:84%
different from their family in
terms of the area of precocity.

00:13:07.532 --> 00:13:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very much so.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.110 align:middle line:90%
Very unique.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And one of the-- Carol
Bowman, continued on.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:17.180 align:middle line:84%
She did similar work
to Stevenson's, but she

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.930 align:middle line:84%
was working with the
children directly

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.280 align:middle line:90%
and I love some of the examples.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.200 align:middle line:84%
You bring up her
work in your book,

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.620 align:middle line:90%
but you have others as well.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.880 align:middle line:84%
But let's, again, by
example because I learn well

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.640 align:middle line:90%
by example.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:29.880 align:middle line:90%
So I like examples.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:34.552 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about the Indian
man with the shortened fingers.

00:13:34.552 --> 00:13:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Sure.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you
give an example

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.185 align:middle line:84%
of how something carries
forward as a trauma

00:13:38.185 --> 00:13:39.310 align:middle line:90%
even from another lifetime?

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:42.390 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Well, this is one of
Ian Stevenson's most well-known

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:48.310 align:middle line:84%
cases because he had observed
that certain features could

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:51.450 align:middle line:84%
carry forth from one
lifetime to another

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:53.590 align:middle line:90%
or appear to carry forward.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:56.130 align:middle line:84%
But this is a case where
you had an accident

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.940 align:middle line:90%
at the end of a lifetime.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Where a person's fingers
were mangled and cut off.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you still
had some carry forward

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:14.330 align:middle line:84%
in the genes that left you
with a disfigured, deformed

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:15.890 align:middle line:90%
same area of the body.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:21.040 align:middle line:84%
I had a case in this with
Claus von Stauffenberg case

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.470 align:middle line:84%
and the person who
may be likely to be

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:28.910 align:middle line:84%
the reincarnation of Claus von
Stauffenberg who had problems

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:37.270 align:middle line:84%
on his fingers, in his eye, on
his back that are coincident

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.330 align:middle line:84%
with the injuries of
Claus von Stauffenberg.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is really,
I mean this brings up,

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.389 align:middle line:90%
this begs a lot of questions.

00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is right down to
birthmarks on the body.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.860 align:middle line:84%
Simple things that
all of us carry.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:53.170 align:middle line:84%
A marking here or maybe a
propensity or weakness there.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:57.690 align:middle line:84%
That may be an imprint
that's carried forward

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:00.210 align:middle line:84%
through the soul portion
of our being and imprints

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.110 align:middle line:90%
on the DNA of our bodies.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
extraordinary things.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.050 align:middle line:84%
You can probably find
something on your own body--

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:07.350 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Sure.

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that may have
been a remnant or an artifact

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.920 align:middle line:84%
of something that had
happened from another time.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: And different
figures, figurations

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.690 align:middle line:84%
in your face and so
on may carry forward.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:21.330 align:middle line:84%
But there's the
underlying bone structure

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.520 align:middle line:84%
which seems to be
carried forward.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And we use the
biometric dimensions

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:31.007 align:middle line:84%
to measure our architecture
of our bone structure.

00:15:31.007 --> 00:15:32.340 align:middle line:90%
And that seems to carry forward.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.830 align:middle line:84%
But then what is
interesting about the fact

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:38.460 align:middle line:84%
that it's a wound in
the past life that gets

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.076 align:middle line:84%
carried forward in
some other form,

00:15:41.076 --> 00:15:42.450 align:middle line:84%
but in the same
part of the body.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Now this suggests something
about the psychoplasm

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.817 align:middle line:84%
or the soul genome
carrying information--

00:15:50.817 --> 00:15:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: --that there
is some deformation that

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:59.720 align:middle line:84%
occurred at the end of life
or near the end of life which

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.080 align:middle line:84%
somehow goes as part
of the epigenome that

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:08.670 align:middle line:84%
is the information around
the specific physical genes

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:11.530 align:middle line:84%
that somehow affect
this new body.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:12.847 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That inform the DNA.

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: That informs--

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I mean,
then we're talking--

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.500 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going to get
into it at this point,

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.610 align:middle line:84%
but you're talking
about this 95% junk DNA.

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:22.460 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Yeah.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.796 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That the human
being supposedly drags around

00:16:24.796 --> 00:16:25.296 align:middle line:90%
with us.

00:16:25.296 --> 00:16:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Right.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.628 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this puts
a little different spin

00:16:27.628 --> 00:16:29.316 align:middle line:84%
on what may be actually
going on there.

00:16:29.316 --> 00:16:30.440 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: No, absolutely.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And we don't even
know whether it

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:36.080 align:middle line:84%
is the junk DNA
or the information

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.044 align:middle line:90%
field which encompasses--

00:16:39.044 --> 00:16:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Permeates or yeah.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:41.126 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Permeates.

00:16:41.126 --> 00:16:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Because when you have a physical
feature of any kind that

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:51.030 align:middle line:84%
has been expressed
by DNA, the genes

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:55.710 align:middle line:84%
that are appropriate for that
part of your body, what happens

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.780 align:middle line:84%
is regardless of the
gene itself that you

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:04.400 align:middle line:84%
might bring from your
parent, it is a question

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.190 align:middle line:84%
of what actually makes it
express one way or the other.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I think we're
talking about consciousness

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:14.790 align:middle line:84%
as part of the soul
genome that activates

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:15.957 align:middle line:90%
the expression of the genes.

00:17:15.957 --> 00:17:18.165 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're getting
into Bruce Lipton's work

00:17:18.165 --> 00:17:19.660 align:middle line:84%
in epigenetics
quite a bit there.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:21.864 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Yeah, I mean,
what we're learning--

00:17:21.864 --> 00:17:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not his
work, but I mean

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.760 align:middle line:84%
his work expresses part
of what you're saying.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.609 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: It's the
same area of science

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:32.280 align:middle line:84%
that is fascinating now because
we know that information that

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:39.480 align:middle line:84%
is consciousness or intention
or some sort of energetic field

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.800 align:middle line:84%
that's not quite in our
three dimensional field.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.107 align:middle line:84%
That's why I call it
the four dimensional.

00:17:44.107 --> 00:17:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: You know,
because it's something

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.800 align:middle line:84%
that the Russians
have been dealing

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.360 align:middle line:84%
with for some time
trying to figure out

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.110 align:middle line:84%
this energetic field
that encompasses

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:57.830 align:middle line:90%
our physical biofield.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:07.990 align:middle line:84%
So we've got now this new area
in science which, in my view,

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:11.660 align:middle line:84%
underpins our
reincarnation theories.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.532 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, it
makes perfect sense.

00:18:13.532 --> 00:18:14.740 align:middle line:90%
You're talking about fields--

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:15.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: There's a mechanism.

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:16.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And one of the examples I
remember in Bruce's work

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:23.970 align:middle line:84%
was that he was talking
about an environment in utero

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:29.310 align:middle line:84%
where a child was going to
be born into a family that

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:31.540 align:middle line:84%
had a fair amount of
domestic violence.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And in response
to this, the child

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:38.440 align:middle line:84%
came out with a thicker
skull than was possessed

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.940 align:middle line:84%
by the other members
of the family

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:45.010 align:middle line:84%
by the previous generation
in the attempt to,

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:47.270 align:middle line:84%
he was extrapolating,
but this was

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:50.210 align:middle line:84%
to be able to protect itself
against the future violence

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.310 align:middle line:90%
that was going to come.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Now you have a lot of questions
that are embedded in that.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Why would a soul choose
such a situation?

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:59.056 align:middle line:84%
Then to be able to
also-- which has

00:18:59.056 --> 00:19:00.680 align:middle line:84%
very good reasons we
would choose that.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.970 align:middle line:84%
That might be our
group that we've

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:03.470 align:middle line:84%
been working things
out with, right?

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:04.440 align:middle line:90%
We'll get into that.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: That's
another question.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:07.741 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But then just to
affect the DNA to the extent

00:19:07.741 --> 00:19:10.502 align:middle line:84%
that you can thicken the skull
while in utero, in development.

00:19:10.502 --> 00:19:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Yeah.

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, this brings to
the point-- I'll just

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.700 align:middle line:90%
make a short point here.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Because we have a
theoretical question

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:21.390 align:middle line:84%
of when does the soul
genome or psychoplasm

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:25.580 align:middle line:84%
engage in the zygote
process of development?

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me
that if we're talking

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:30.070 align:middle line:84%
about these energetic fields
and information fields

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:34.000 align:middle line:84%
that it is likely to happen
when you have the fertilized

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.030 align:middle line:84%
egg seeking to implant
itself in the uterine wall,

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:42.460 align:middle line:84%
because there is a
chemical electrical set

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.450 align:middle line:84%
of communications that
determine whether or not

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.110 align:middle line:84%
the uterine wall
will actually accept

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:50.640 align:middle line:90%
that particular fertilized egg.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.611 align:middle line:84%
And so it seems that this
sort of field of information--

00:19:53.611 --> 00:19:55.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
feel that you think

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.060 align:middle line:84%
that it happens at that
moment before it even

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.266 align:middle line:90%
attaches to the wall?

00:19:58.266 --> 00:19:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: I
think it is before.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:00.556 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:20:00.556 --> 00:20:02.890 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Because I
think it is information.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:04.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like the
synapses in our brain.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, we don't have a
connection between a dentrite

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:10.000 align:middle line:90%
and another synapse over here.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.380 align:middle line:84%
We have a space and that space
is a chemical electrical area

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.630 align:middle line:90%
of communication.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:22.420 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the soul genome,
or psychoplasm as I call it,

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:26.150 align:middle line:90%
is that kind of phenomenon.

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:31.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the soul would
start expressing its connection

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:36.320 align:middle line:84%
with the egg before it even
attaches you're saying?

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: No, in the process.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:38.445 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the process.

00:20:38.445 --> 00:20:38.945 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:38.945 --> 00:20:42.035 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: That is, if you
look at the Buddhist tradition,

00:20:42.035 --> 00:20:44.700 align:middle line:84%
you know, one of the things
they say as they're chanting

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:49.630 align:middle line:84%
for the soul to make sure it
gets in the right copulating

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:53.310 align:middle line:84%
couple and make sure they're
getting in the right connection

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:56.390 align:middle line:84%
that they want to have
for the next lifetime--

00:20:56.390 --> 00:21:00.500 align:middle line:84%
that ancient view from
Buddhism seems to me to be

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:04.430 align:middle line:84%
compatible with this modern
scientific perspective

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:08.880 align:middle line:84%
of some connection point in
the process of the physical

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.900 align:middle line:84%
and the non-physical coming
together to make it function.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.371 align:middle line:84%
And I'm speculating
at this point,

00:21:13.371 --> 00:21:15.870 align:middle line:84%
but it makes logical sense that
something like that happens.

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:17.328 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, that
does make sense.

00:21:17.328 --> 00:21:20.380 align:middle line:84%
I want to share something with
you that was an esoteric thing

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.380 align:middle line:84%
and I'll go out on a
limb a little bit here.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.835 align:middle line:84%
But I was having dinner
with a prominent physicist,

00:21:25.835 --> 00:21:27.590 align:middle line:90%
this was a number of years ago.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:28.820 align:middle line:90%
And he was writing a book.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.820 align:middle line:84%
I won't say the name and
I won't say the book.

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And he had gained some
reputation in this field,

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.014 align:middle line:84%
but now he was
working on a new book.

00:21:37.014 --> 00:21:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And in this book,
they were trying

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.720 align:middle line:84%
to find what was the
differentiating factor

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.560 align:middle line:84%
between the way one brain
and one consciousness

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.460 align:middle line:90%
develops versus another.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, I said,
well, what was the organizing

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.290 align:middle line:90%
principle, was the word he used.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, "Do
you know the answer?"

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:57.584 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "No, but
I'll figure it out

00:21:57.584 --> 00:21:59.250 align:middle line:84%
by the time I'm
finished with the book."

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:01.166 align:middle line:84%
And I had a little chuckle
with him over that.

00:22:01.166 --> 00:22:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a
casual conversation.

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:05.600 align:middle line:84%
So I believe it was
the next morning

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.065 align:middle line:84%
or maybe two mornings later
as I was in that crossover

00:22:08.065 --> 00:22:11.990 align:middle line:84%
state between dream
time and wakefulness,

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:15.250 align:middle line:84%
a voice said to me, and
I wrote it down here,

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:20.960 align:middle line:84%
but the organizing principle
behind quantum coherence

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:25.210 align:middle line:84%
and the human mind is the
intention of the soul.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:27.294 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That makes sense.

00:22:27.294 --> 00:22:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: I think
this make sense.

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:33.340 align:middle line:84%
When I speak to my
neuroscience colleagues

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:37.830 align:middle line:84%
about how this consciousness,
mind, brain interaction

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:42.630 align:middle line:84%
functions and they have
a dilemma because what

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.470 align:middle line:84%
we can study now with the
technologies that we have

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:47.770 align:middle line:90%
is a bottom up principle.

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And so we see mind being
formed, and memories,

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.040 align:middle line:90%
and learning from the bottom up.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:58.010 align:middle line:84%
But we have no sense of
the top down function which

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:01.380 align:middle line:84%
brings the integration
and takes all

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:05.110 align:middle line:84%
of these multitudes
of signals coming in

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:07.160 align:middle line:84%
through our sensory
systems and then

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.490 align:middle line:84%
make out of it the images,
those concepts, and all

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.550 align:middle line:84%
of those things that
we have created.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, that's part of the
process of reincarnation

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.920 align:middle line:84%
because that pre-exists
this lifetime.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.430 align:middle line:84%
That's what carries forward
from one life to the other,

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:27.345 align:middle line:90%
in my view.

00:23:27.345 --> 00:23:29.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
it makes perfect sense.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And then also, in your
book you speak quite a bit

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:34.630 align:middle line:90%
about nonlocal consciousness.

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Which is really, I
mean, that's what

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.310 align:middle line:90%
the soul would be considered.

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:41.500 align:middle line:84%
In a physical sense, a
nonlocal consciousness.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And so if we're looking
at nonlocal consciousness,

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:47.570 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at memory that
extends beyond the brain.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And you gave a couple of
examples in the book and one

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:54.270 align:middle line:84%
was about, as I recall, it
was a college student who

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:57.220 align:middle line:84%
had around 126 IQ,
something like that.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Oh yes, yes.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.636 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who had
some issue where

00:23:59.636 --> 00:24:01.430 align:middle line:84%
they had to go in
and do an operation,

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:03.304 align:middle line:84%
perform an operational
procedure on the brain

00:24:03.304 --> 00:24:04.940 align:middle line:84%
only to find there
was nothing there.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:05.815 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: No brain.

00:24:05.815 --> 00:24:06.870 align:middle line:90%
It was a brain stem.

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But to find only
there was just a fluid sac.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Yeah.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.204 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The grey
matter wasn't there.

00:24:12.204 --> 00:24:13.334 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Yet the IQ--

00:24:13.334 --> 00:24:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was 126.

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: 126 with that.

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:21.480 align:middle line:84%
This is the conundrum that
neuroscience has today.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:26.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's really
limited by its technology.

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're
developing here

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:34.000 align:middle line:84%
in this concept of a
psychoplasm or soul genome,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.580 align:middle line:84%
we're talking
about consciousness

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:41.640 align:middle line:84%
as a transcendent aspect
of the universe which

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:48.140 align:middle line:84%
can express itself in a
body like the info field

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:50.401 align:middle line:90%
expresses itself through a gene.

00:24:50.401 --> 00:24:50.900 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: As above, so below.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So below, right.

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: So you're looking
at it just at a different level.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the model that we

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.110 align:middle line:84%
need to work with in
thinking about reincarnation.

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
as a lot of people

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.560 align:middle line:84%
think and sort of wishful
thinking, I think,

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:12.380 align:middle line:84%
to say, oh, the soul, spirit
just comes into a body

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.990 align:middle line:90%
and has a physical experience.

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:16.380 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't make sense either.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.421 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it doesn't.

00:25:17.421 --> 00:25:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Because the body
and all of our functions

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:24.790 align:middle line:84%
are integrated with our
brain system and so on.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:28.510 align:middle line:84%
So we really have
the physical body

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:32.140 align:middle line:84%
as an expression of a
total kind of entity

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.480 align:middle line:84%
that shapes the physical
side, the physical

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:39.640 align:middle line:84%
has its influence on
the consciousness side.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.540 align:middle line:90%
It's an interactive process.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's certainly
clear when we

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:47.444 align:middle line:84%
look at personalities and
behaviors that we talk about.

00:25:47.444 --> 00:25:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes and
when you take the soul

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:51.410 align:middle line:84%
factor into consideration
rather than just being

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:54.190 align:middle line:84%
some kind of random
self-organizing thing,

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:57.660 align:middle line:84%
this is where you get the notion
of individuated consciousness.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Yeah, but I
use the term individuated

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:07.300 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, but I need to
qualify that with the notion

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.289 align:middle line:84%
that all of us are
connected, entangled,

00:26:10.289 --> 00:26:11.580 align:middle line:90%
as we say in quantum mechanics.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We are entangled, yes.

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: So we're not
totally separate from but it's

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.550 align:middle line:90%
like a laser.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:25.430 align:middle line:84%
A laser is light waves
concentrated in one area.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So I look at the soul
genome as consciousness

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.730 align:middle line:84%
concentrated in a
particular area.

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.554 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we mean by
individuated consciousness.

00:26:34.554 --> 00:26:35.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.580 align:middle line:84%
That can carry forward
with its unique expression,

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:40.300 align:middle line:84%
unique memories, et cetera
while still being entangled

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.630 align:middle line:90%
with the rest of the whole.

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
we have religions

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.534 align:middle line:90%
that try to unravel this one.

00:26:45.534 --> 00:26:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Yes.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
fortunately, we have

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.960 align:middle line:84%
people like Dean
Radin who are also

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.610 align:middle line:84%
trying to unravel it
along with others.

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: And he's
doing a good job

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:53.425 align:middle line:90%
looking at that issue, yeah.

00:26:53.425 --> 00:26:55.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, he is
doing a good job on it.

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.980 align:middle line:84%
And we are going to-- we
have in the rest of this

00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.550 align:middle line:84%
we have a lot of
images coming up.

00:26:59.550 --> 00:26:59.680 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Oh, yeah.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:00.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:02.653 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to take a
little break in a minute here.

00:27:02.653 --> 00:27:06.200 align:middle line:84%
But we have images coming up
of James Madison and a more

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.180 align:middle line:90%
recent James Two.

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Revolutionaries.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Revolutionaries.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.178 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
talk about that.

00:27:10.178 --> 00:27:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Where are they now
when we need them?

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about Marilyn Monroe.

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:15.840 align:middle line:90%
Elizabeth Browning, the poet.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.770 align:middle line:90%
And then her newer self.

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:18.890 align:middle line:90%
And Gurdjieff.

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And so we have some
images for all those.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.027 align:middle line:90%
So don't go away.

00:27:22.027 --> 00:27:24.360 align:middle line:10%
We're going to take a short
break and when we come back,

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.797 align:middle line:10%
we'll show you all
of these comparisons.

00:27:27.797 --> 00:27:34.160 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.040 align:middle line:90%
And we're back.

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And we've already
teased you enough.

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:38.570 align:middle line:84%
We're going to start
going into this.

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:40.230 align:middle line:84%
I need you to explain
one thing for us.

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:41.570 align:middle line:84%
There are five
different factors.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:43.330 align:middle line:84%
You touched a little
bit on a couple of them

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:45.400 align:middle line:84%
earlier, but just tell
us one, two, three, four,

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.250 align:middle line:84%
five; the five
different factors you're

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:49.790 align:middle line:84%
looking for in this
evaluation process.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Right, we think
the model of the soul genome

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.960 align:middle line:90%
can be divided into five.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.405 align:middle line:84%
One is the physical, of course,
the genome, the biometrics

00:27:58.405 --> 00:27:59.900 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.560 align:middle line:84%
The other is the cerebrotype,
which is the mind.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.810 align:middle line:90%
The way we use our intellect.

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:08.190 align:middle line:84%
What the intellect is and
how it functions for us.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:13.180 align:middle line:84%
We look at the performotype
which is how we do our things.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's art, or
math, or whatever.

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:21.560 align:middle line:84%
We have a pattern that we can
see from lifetime to lifetime.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.130 align:middle line:84%
We have the ego
type which is really

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:28.790 align:middle line:90%
our emotional type of behavior.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Whether we are passive
or aggressive and so on.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:36.435 align:middle line:90%
And the other one is which--

00:28:36.435 --> 00:28:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's see,
we have phenotype,

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.240 align:middle line:84%
genotypes,
cerebrotypes, egotypes,

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.780 align:middle line:90%
and you just said performotypes.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:44.710 align:middle line:90%
Did we get them all?

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: I think
we've got them.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.858 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so we're going
to start out with the example.

00:28:47.858 --> 00:28:50.500 align:middle line:84%
We want to go to the
example of James Madison.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to use this
as a really strong example

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.180 align:middle line:90%
of a cerebrotype.

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:58.240 align:middle line:84%
But a large argument can
be made also for the geno,

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.740 align:middle line:84%
phenotype as well when
we look at these images.

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what we're seeing
here left to right.

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:05.096 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Well, left to
right, the one on the left

00:29:05.096 --> 00:29:09.000 align:middle line:84%
is a painting of James
Madison at age 31.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.770 align:middle line:84%
The one in the middle
is a charcoal portrait

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:18.000 align:middle line:84%
of James Two-- we don't tell the
identity of this person-- that

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.720 align:middle line:84%
was also painted about the same
time in his lifetime about age

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.750 align:middle line:90%
32 or so.

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And the one on the
right is a transposition

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:32.380 align:middle line:84%
of these two figures,
sort of a composite

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.750 align:middle line:90%
to see how closely they match.

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.400 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's pretty obvious.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.733 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's pretty obvious.

00:29:37.733 --> 00:29:40.364 align:middle line:84%
I mean even with the beard which
would not show his jaw line.

00:29:40.364 --> 00:29:42.280 align:middle line:84%
But you can get an idea
of what's under there.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.155 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: And what's
even more interesting,

00:29:44.155 --> 00:29:48.410 align:middle line:84%
in this particular case,
James Madison had just--

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:50.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Shaved his beard?

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: No, no.

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:54.540 align:middle line:84%
He gave this to a woman
that he was engaged to

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.260 align:middle line:90%
and hoped to marry.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And the other guy
is on his honeymoon,

00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:59.899 align:middle line:90%
just having been married.

00:29:59.899 --> 00:30:00.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh interesting.

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:02.194 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: And the eyes.

00:30:02.194 --> 00:30:04.110 align:middle line:84%
You might not be able
to see it at this scale,

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:06.507 align:middle line:84%
but they're looking at
exactly in the same direction.

00:30:06.507 --> 00:30:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:08.548 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Painted
by two artists.

00:30:08.548 --> 00:30:09.760 align:middle line:90%
Two parts of the world.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:10.760 align:middle line:90%
Two hundred years apart.

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A couple
hundred years apart.

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: And
we have many cases

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:18.000 align:middle line:84%
that are like this, where the
variance in the biometrics

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.320 align:middle line:90%
is 1% or less.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now in this one,
was that variance 1% or less?

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Yes, yes.

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK and the
facial biometrics.

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Yeah.

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:27.081 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:27.081 --> 00:30:28.667 align:middle line:84%
Now that speaks well
to the genotype.

00:30:28.667 --> 00:30:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: It does.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about the cerebrotype.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's give a little
example of what

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.930 align:middle line:84%
was going on in
each of their lives

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:36.940 align:middle line:84%
that would indicate
this same soul

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.350 align:middle line:84%
was carrying these same
patterns, same kinds

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:42.530 align:middle line:84%
of thoughts, activities,
and talents forward.

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Well, James
Madison, for example,

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.290 align:middle line:84%
was going to what
is now Princeton.

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.050 align:middle line:84%
He was very
interested in theology

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:52.430 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of that
particular lifetime.

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:56.530 align:middle line:84%
He got involved in sort of
philosophical, political issues

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:58.610 align:middle line:84%
because the revolution
was beginning

00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:02.530 align:middle line:84%
to fester against
England at that time.

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:07.920 align:middle line:84%
His father appointed him
to be an officer when

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:14.590 align:middle line:84%
he got back home to play a
little role in the local army.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:16.295 align:middle line:84%
But he was thinking
about maybe he

00:31:16.295 --> 00:31:18.650 align:middle line:84%
would study law and
become a lawyer.

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
things evolved

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.270 align:middle line:84%
that he was elected as a
delegate, got into politics,

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:28.430 align:middle line:84%
and then started working
on the Constitution and all

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:30.240 align:middle line:90%
of those things.

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:36.650 align:middle line:84%
James Two had a very similar
way of thinking and going

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:38.830 align:middle line:84%
about issues and
looking at them.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.557 align:middle line:90%
And he followed-- it's uncanny.

00:31:40.557 --> 00:31:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Almost the
exact same track.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Almost
exactly the same thing.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.528 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean even
geographically they

00:31:45.528 --> 00:31:49.340 align:middle line:84%
were in a very--
basically the same area.

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: There are some
other differences that

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.820 align:middle line:84%
indicate that there were
some issues of karma

00:31:54.820 --> 00:32:01.700 align:middle line:84%
of the second person having
to pay some of the karmic debt

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.910 align:middle line:84%
that James had
developed in his life

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:06.830 align:middle line:84%
in terms of being
a slave holder,

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:11.180 align:middle line:84%
and the way he handled
his family and finances,

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:12.389 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:14.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So James number two
had to do a little debt paying?

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:17.138 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: He had to do a
little bit of debt paying.

00:32:17.138 --> 00:32:18.835 align:middle line:84%
And I think, if I
remember correctly,

00:32:18.835 --> 00:32:23.260 align:middle line:84%
he's still paying
some at this stage.

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And he's also involved in other
revolutionaries, some of which

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:31.274 align:middle line:84%
are reincarnated in
this period of time.

00:32:31.274 --> 00:32:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
get to that in a little bit

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.170 align:middle line:84%
because I do want
to talk about that.

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:36.806 align:middle line:90%
Like I said, where are they now?

00:32:36.806 --> 00:32:38.680 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting
when you start looking.

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.995 align:middle line:84%
As you say, James Madison
had-- that was his expression

00:32:41.995 --> 00:32:44.290 align:middle line:84%
in that lifetime
as this statesman.

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:47.490 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
because we have what

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:49.940 align:middle line:84%
is perceived to be an elevated
status in one lifetime

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.315 align:middle line:84%
that we're going
to keep carrying

00:32:51.315 --> 00:32:52.890 align:middle line:84%
that same tradition
forward at all.

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:55.056 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: In fact, the
history of many cases where

00:32:55.056 --> 00:32:57.890 align:middle line:84%
we have several different
past lifetimes that we think

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:03.770 align:middle line:84%
are well documented you see
this up and down differing

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:07.470 align:middle line:84%
experiences but dealing with
some of the same issues.

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also
expanding one's

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.460 align:middle line:90%
experience and understanding.

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, like you say,
adjusting for a little karma

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:15.170 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:18.030 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that was--
that's very interesting.

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:20.799 align:middle line:84%
And now I want to take
a look at Sherrie Laird.

00:33:20.799 --> 00:33:21.590 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Oh yes.

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:22.810 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Marilyn Monroe.

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:26.480 align:middle line:10%
And this is the one, see
here where we're doing this--

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.310 align:middle line:10%
this progression--

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:27.860 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: Progression, yeah.

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:28.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --of these two.

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: This
is a case developed

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:32.990 align:middle line:84%
by a friend and colleague,
Adrian Finkelstein.

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:36.810 align:middle line:10%
He had worked with Sherrie
for quite some time developing

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:42.011 align:middle line:10%
the history of her case as
being the incarnation of Marilyn

00:33:42.011 --> 00:33:42.510 align:middle line:10%
Monroe.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:44.490 align:middle line:10%
And we met at a
conference some years back

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:48.680 align:middle line:10%
and I-- at that time, I had just
developed the biometrics model

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.274 align:middle line:10%
and the technology
for doing that.

00:33:50.274 --> 00:33:52.690 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: This is the case you
were talking about earlier.

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.830 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: Yeah, so
Adrian said to me, Paul,

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:56.590 align:middle line:10%
I've worked on this case.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:34:01.620 align:middle line:10%
Let's see how your model
will work with this set of--

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.080 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Biometrics, yeah.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.550 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: --two photographs.

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:06.230 align:middle line:10%
So he gave them to
me, and I went back

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:10.040 align:middle line:10%
and did my little
diametric measurements.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:14.889 align:middle line:10%
And we do ratios of
differences to determine

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:16.380 align:middle line:10%
how much variance there is.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.580 align:middle line:10%
And I called him
back and I said,

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:21.820 align:middle line:10%
Adrian, that's less than 1%.

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:25.359 align:middle line:10%
If these two photographs
were passed to the CIA,

00:34:25.359 --> 00:34:25.900 align:middle line:10%
they would---

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:26.190 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: They'd mistake
one for the other.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:27.679 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: --say, this
is the same person.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:28.429 align:middle line:10%
Exactly.

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:30.500 align:middle line:10%
And so he was very
excited about that

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:34.070 align:middle line:10%
because it confirmed
at the physical level

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.560 align:middle line:10%
what he'd been dealing with
at the psychological level.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.101 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about that part.

00:34:38.101 --> 00:34:40.889 align:middle line:10%
Because Sherrie Laird had
had some rather dramatic kind

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:43.044 align:middle line:10%
of remembrances that
were unpleasant.

00:34:43.044 --> 00:34:43.710 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Yes.

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:45.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you talk
about that a little bit?

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:46.929 align:middle line:84%
What kind of started
tipping this off?

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:48.909 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Well,
let me just say

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:52.780 align:middle line:84%
that one of the things that
Adrian did working with Sherrie

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.770 align:middle line:84%
over the years was
helping her with some

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:56.400 align:middle line:90%
of her psychological issues.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And what we
discovered, Adrian did,

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:04.030 align:middle line:84%
and as we looked at this from
a developmental perspective

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:11.830 align:middle line:84%
that Marilyn had a very
dependent personality, got

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:16.590 align:middle line:84%
caught up in relationships with
men that weren't good for her,

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:18.280 align:middle line:90%
and we all know that story.

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, same sort of issues
were happening with Sherrie.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:23.210 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that
would cover most women.

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.830 align:middle line:90%
A lot of women.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: I don't
want to go there.

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:29.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to go there.

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:29.884 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm joking.

00:35:29.884 --> 00:35:31.160 align:middle line:90%
I didn't mean it.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: But what--
Marilyn, you know,

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:39.020 align:middle line:90%
would then act out those issues.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Sherrie was doing
the same thing.

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Adrian was working
with her on that.

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:46.560 align:middle line:90%


00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:50.190 align:middle line:84%
The tendency towards
suicidal activities,

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:52.280 align:middle line:84%
that was another
issue like that.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was displaying
a lot of Marilyn's tendencies.

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:58.382 align:middle line:90%
But then she had a recall.

00:35:58.382 --> 00:36:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Yeah, well she had
recalls that reminded her--

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:07.862 align:middle line:90%
and this is a little bit of a--

00:36:07.862 --> 00:36:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is it a stretch or?

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:09.345 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Question.

00:36:09.345 --> 00:36:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: I mean,
in other words,

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:18.585 align:middle line:84%
you have the problem of did
Sherrie have information--

00:36:18.585 --> 00:36:20.335 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, or
was it genuine recall?

00:36:20.335 --> 00:36:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: --from
other sources.

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:middle line:84%
But I think that what happened
in the length of that case

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.480 align:middle line:84%
when Adrian worked on
it over many years,

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.530 align:middle line:84%
I think he had enough
of those examples

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:35.656 align:middle line:84%
to say that there was
probably some recall in that.

00:36:35.656 --> 00:36:38.196 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the one I was
referring to was the one around

00:36:38.196 --> 00:36:39.222 align:middle line:90%
Marilyn's death--

00:36:39.222 --> 00:36:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Yeah.

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:42.013 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that Sherrie
was supposedly recalling.

00:36:42.013 --> 00:36:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Yeah, but see, I
don't know how to deal with

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:48.744 align:middle line:90%
that because we have a lot of--

00:36:48.744 --> 00:36:49.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That could happen.

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Famous people, we
can read about them.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: We can
read about them.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: And
it could be, see,

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.480 align:middle line:84%
that gets into the
what I would call

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.840 align:middle line:84%
the telepathic
kind of connection.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:06.174 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: But the package,
I think, holds together.

00:37:06.174 --> 00:37:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It holds together.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:11.062 align:middle line:84%
And the strongest parts are the
genotype, the phenotype, the--

00:37:11.062 --> 00:37:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Also in the talent areas.

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Both were interested
in acting and music

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and they had flip-flopped,
but Marilyn in the beginning

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.340 align:middle line:84%
had wanted to be
a musician, too,

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.130 align:middle line:84%
and then became an
actor and vice versa.

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:29.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now we're going to
take a look at an egotype.

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:31.504 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be seeing
Elizabeth Browning.

00:37:31.504 --> 00:37:32.169 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Yep.

00:37:32.169 --> 00:37:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:33.850 align:middle line:10%
And Paula.

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:34.250 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: Yes, Paula.

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:35.916 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And let's
take a look at this.

00:37:35.916 --> 00:37:36.830 align:middle line:10%
Now-- wow.

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:39.100 align:middle line:10%
Well, just energetically.

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:41.380 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: Oh,
I have any number

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:44.120 align:middle line:10%
of paired images of these two.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:48.110 align:middle line:10%
Now Paula is in her
50s at this point,

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:52.100 align:middle line:10%
but we have good photographs
of Elizabeth Barrett-Browning

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.090 align:middle line:10%
and Paula to compare.

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:55.570 align:middle line:10%
And this is one of
these cases that

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:58.865 align:middle line:10%
is, once again, right
in the 1% category.

00:37:58.865 --> 00:37:59.842 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:59.842 --> 00:38:01.300 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: But
what is interesting

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:06.630 align:middle line:10%
here is the egotype in
terms of the dependency that

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:12.910 align:middle line:10%
both developed on drug usage
very, very, very early.

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:16.770 align:middle line:10%
But what's interesting about
that, I mean, a lot of people

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:17.880 align:middle line:10%
could be paired--

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.460 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Sure, they look
alike and they have drug issues

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:24.020 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: --but in
spite of those problems,

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:25.720 align:middle line:10%
you had the poetry, of course.

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.450 align:middle line:10%
And you have the poetry
that is a world-renowned.

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:32.390 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's supposed to
say Paula, not Paul, by the way.

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:34.335 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: Oh that was
supposed to be Paula.

00:38:34.335 --> 00:38:35.100 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: That's an old one.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:35.600 align:middle line:10%
Paula.

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.700 align:middle line:10%
Just to correct that.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:37.580 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: The typo.

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:38.125 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's a typo.

00:38:38.125 --> 00:38:39.625 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: The
typo there is Paula.

00:38:39.625 --> 00:38:42.960 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I won't use her last name,
but she's a psychologist now

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.750 align:middle line:10%
working for the US government
helping military personnel

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:47.250 align:middle line:10%
and so on.

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:50.170 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But you could almost
see the same feelings, life

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:52.484 align:middle line:10%
experience, and expressions
certainly coming out

00:38:52.484 --> 00:38:53.900 align:middle line:10%
of both of their
eyes in this one.

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:55.316 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: That's
why I mentioned

00:38:55.316 --> 00:38:57.680 align:middle line:10%
that about the James
and James Two case.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:03.310 align:middle line:10%
Often we see images mirroring
not only the biometrics,

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:06.110 align:middle line:10%
but something of the
emotion involved.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
both women who also

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.720 align:middle line:84%
depended on sort of
cult connections.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Having somebody tell them
about the paranormal and the--

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:19.080 align:middle line:90%


00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Same interest.

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: So you
have both the physical,

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:27.485 align:middle line:84%
the artistic in terms
of poetry, and these--

00:39:27.485 --> 00:39:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The cerebrotype
aspects as well.

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: --egotypes,
all of them.

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:33.510 align:middle line:90%
They really match there.

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:38.204 align:middle line:84%
All of these cases are strong
in all five of the categories.

00:39:38.204 --> 00:39:38.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: So we're just
looking at them as examples.

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, which is
why we're looking at these,

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:43.200 align:middle line:84%
but you have a couple
hundred other cases, too.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.640 align:middle line:84%
OK, the next one we're
going to go to is Gurdjieff.

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.480 align:middle line:90%
He's a rascal.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.430 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: This is an
interesting one because--

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:51.640 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, look at that.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.870 align:middle line:10%
Look at those two guys.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:56.360 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: Yeah, this is--
the guy below is Drago Plecko.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:59.460 align:middle line:10%
He's a good friend and
colleague over in Croatia.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:03.820 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't invent this.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.796 align:middle line:10%
People started telling
him some years ago,

00:40:05.796 --> 00:40:08.380 align:middle line:10%
you know, you look
like Gurdjieff.

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:11.344 align:middle line:10%
And so he made a
picture of himself

00:40:11.344 --> 00:40:12.510 align:middle line:10%
and I took a picture of him.

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:15.060 align:middle line:10%
And we compared the
biometrics and so on.

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:16.970 align:middle line:10%
That was very strong.

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:20.170 align:middle line:10%
And then we started
looking back and I

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:24.010 align:middle line:10%
had to go back into Gurdjieff's
early life, you know,

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:26.250 align:middle line:10%
before he became this
famous mystic who

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:29.080 align:middle line:10%
set up schools and
wrote books that

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.330 align:middle line:10%
so affected many
people in the West.

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:33.960 align:middle line:10%
They were aggressive
with people,

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.470 align:middle line:10%
they were somewhat
circus barker types,

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:41.000 align:middle line:10%
you know, selling their
ideas and then promoting

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.210 align:middle line:10%
some scheme or the other.

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:44.860 align:middle line:10%
Terrible drivers, both of them.

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:48.350 align:middle line:10%
In fact, Drago, his family
won't let him drive anymore

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:49.985 align:middle line:10%
because he's--

00:40:49.985 --> 00:40:51.360 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Such a
horrible driver.

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.820 align:middle line:10%
>>VON WARD: Such a bad driver.

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:59.560 align:middle line:10%
So we matched up all of these
different factors in our model,

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.750 align:middle line:10%
and it's just a
very interesting,

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:03.320 align:middle line:10%
interesting combination.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:08.340 align:middle line:10%
Now, of course, Gurdjieff
was looking for great men

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.900 align:middle line:10%
around the Middle
East and so on.

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:15.770 align:middle line:10%
Well, Drago has done
documentaries of the Dalai Lama

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:18.510 align:middle line:10%
and all kind of mystical
people around the planet,

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:25.080 align:middle line:10%
and he's been following a
healer in the Adriatic Sea area

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.710 align:middle line:10%
and has gotten a lot
of attention for that.

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:29.870 align:middle line:90%
Just a fascinating guy.

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And so all of these
features are there,

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:38.700 align:middle line:84%
but it just shows you that
the mystical, spiritual person

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:43.337 align:middle line:84%
at another level was a
rough kind of personality.

00:41:43.337 --> 00:41:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: And had
behavior traits that

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:52.430 align:middle line:84%
were, on the surface,
inconsistent with the way

00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:54.244 align:middle line:90%
we think of them today.

00:41:54.244 --> 00:41:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:59.060 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: But this is what
makes this fun because you

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:04.190 align:middle line:84%
see the things that are
not the most publicly

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:08.570 align:middle line:90%
publicized reputation of people.

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:10.980 align:middle line:84%
This is a good way
of expressing that.

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as you say
in your book, as well,

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:15.820 align:middle line:84%
there are only so many
factors we can go on

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.670 align:middle line:84%
in determining this within any
scientific framework at all.

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're
looking at a soul which

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:25.870 align:middle line:84%
lives in dimensions beyond
this density of this field

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:28.340 align:middle line:84%
we're in right
now, we don't have

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:31.474 align:middle line:84%
the capability scientifically
to measure them

00:42:31.474 --> 00:42:33.390 align:middle line:84%
when they're in maybe a
sixth, seventh, eighth

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:35.410 align:middle line:90%
dimensional aspect.

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:36.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not possible.

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:39.187 align:middle line:84%
So we can only go one what's
evidenced in this dimension.

00:42:39.187 --> 00:42:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Let me say
something about that.

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:43.460 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
reason I use this model

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.990 align:middle line:84%
and with different factors
is because, you know,

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:48.660 align:middle line:84%
we've all heard about
the twin studies that

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.520 align:middle line:90%
were started decades ago.

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:53.545 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: When twins were
separated shortly after birth

00:42:53.545 --> 00:42:55.590 align:middle line:84%
and they were discovered
by psychologists

00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:58.470 align:middle line:84%
and found not only did they
have their physical features,

00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:02.470 align:middle line:84%
like we have in these cases,
but they also had other factors.

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:08.230 align:middle line:84%
The personality, their habits,
the wife of both of them

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:10.027 align:middle line:90%
happened to be the same names.

00:43:10.027 --> 00:43:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Same names, even, yes.

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: You know, all these
sort of little picayune things

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:19.270 align:middle line:84%
that you would think, why
would they all be the same?

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is no
psychologist today

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:25.750 align:middle line:84%
who will claim that they
have discovered the DNA

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:29.880 align:middle line:84%
to account for those kind
of behavioral similarities.

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And say-- they say,
oh well, there's

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:37.840 align:middle line:84%
just something about the twin
that makes this kind of detail

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.860 align:middle line:84%
fall out over decades
of living elsewhere.

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you think about
this in terms of two

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:48.226 align:middle line:84%
lifetimes and you
still have that level

00:43:48.226 --> 00:43:54.200 align:middle line:84%
of coincidence of
taste, names, locations,

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:56.660 align:middle line:90%
particular habits, and so on.

00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:02.640 align:middle line:84%
That is a very
powerful coincidence

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.104 align:middle line:84%
to claim that it just
happened by accident.

00:44:05.104 --> 00:44:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:09.330 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: We've done
statistical analyses

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:14.910 align:middle line:84%
of these kinds of
similarities as psychologists

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:16.660 align:middle line:90%
have done with twins.

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot say that these
two lifetimes with all these

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:25.040 align:middle line:84%
similarities that we describe
in the book cannot be

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:31.400 align:middle line:84%
statistically, scientifically
relegated to coincidence

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.034 align:middle line:90%
or randomness.

00:44:32.034 --> 00:44:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: So there
has to be a mechanism.

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.310 align:middle line:90%
There has to be some connection.

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And we call that psychoplasm
or the soul genome.

00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And you had-- you were--
last time I saw you--

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:45.730 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed you
a few years ago--

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:47.860 align:middle line:84%
you were encouraging
people if they

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:49.970 align:middle line:84%
had some curiosity
about themselves

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:51.860 align:middle line:84%
or some kind of
inkling of someone

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:55.000 align:middle line:84%
they may have been to join
you in your reincarnation

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:55.540 align:middle line:90%
experiments.

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Now since I talked to you,
how has that all played out?

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:01.475 align:middle line:84%
Do most people-- like, all
these that we just looked at, do

00:45:01.475 --> 00:45:04.346 align:middle line:84%
they easily buy into the notion
that that was them once they're

00:45:04.346 --> 00:45:06.470 align:middle line:84%
presented with the evidence
or is there resistance?

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: No, no, no.

00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:16.150 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people want to be
told by a psychic or someone

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:19.380 align:middle line:84%
from the Pleiadian
group who they

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.260 align:middle line:90%
were in a particular lifetime.

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And people who
stop at that level

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:27.700 align:middle line:84%
don't get much out of
it except an ego boost.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:28.784 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or not.

00:45:28.784 --> 00:45:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Or not, if it
doesn't work out that way.

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:35.800 align:middle line:84%
But I would say less than
50% of the people who've

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:40.670 align:middle line:84%
come to us saying, "I'd like
to work with you on my case,"

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:45.960 align:middle line:84%
have taken the time to go
into the detail of comparisons

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.550 align:middle line:90%
that we've been talking about.

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
people when they discover

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:56.600 align:middle line:84%
that it's hard work, they
don't want to stay with it.

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:59.680 align:middle line:84%
But let me tell you, those
who have stayed with it

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.800 align:middle line:84%
have an understanding
of themselves

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:07.230 align:middle line:84%
in a way that no
amount of counseling,

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:12.970 align:middle line:84%
psychological workups would
give that level of insight

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:14.970 align:middle line:90%
into who they are.

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Because once you start
seeing a trajectory of traits

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:25.560 align:middle line:84%
in a historical context with
your present life and say,

00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:27.300 align:middle line:90%
oh, I see how that works.

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: See where
it's coming from.

00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: I see
where it comes from.

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:30.390 align:middle line:90%
It's an explanation.

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:32.600 align:middle line:84%
I now understand why
I have this problem

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.370 align:middle line:84%
with my wife, or my
kids, or my boss,

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:39.870 align:middle line:84%
or my lack of interest
in this job that I have.

00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, no wonder I don't like
this job because that's not

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:45.210 align:middle line:90%
what I am at this level.

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:47.640 align:middle line:84%
As I was using my own
example earlier, you know,

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:51.720 align:middle line:84%
the reason I left a lot of what
people would consider to be

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:56.316 align:middle line:84%
very desirable professional
situations-- well,

00:46:56.316 --> 00:46:58.060 align:middle line:90%
that wasn't my inner--

00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:59.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It wasn't your path.

00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And now, Teekamp went
through this, too.

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:05.380 align:middle line:84%
When he was made aware about
the Gauguin connection,

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:08.961 align:middle line:84%
he started realizing that some
of these behaviors, once we

00:47:08.961 --> 00:47:10.960 align:middle line:84%
realize they were carried
forward, some of these

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:13.130 align:middle line:84%
were not really
desirable characteristics

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:14.060 align:middle line:90%
to continue with.

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: No, no.

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:19.030 align:middle line:84%
One of them, of course,
was suicide attempt.

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:21.760 align:middle line:84%
The way he treated
his wife and children.

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.730 align:middle line:90%
Those kinds of activities.

00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Recognition that, hey,
I'm carrying something

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:29.640 align:middle line:90%
from the past.

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:31.780 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't understand
it at the time.

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:34.300 align:middle line:84%
I have an explanation
for it now.

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And he then makes a conscious
choice: I'm going to change.

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
value of these kinds

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:47.040 align:middle line:84%
of assessments of
past life legacies.

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:51.580 align:middle line:84%
If you don't use them to
give you insight into changes

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:53.820 align:middle line:84%
that you could make, then
it's not worth very much.

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It really
isn't worth very much.

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Like you say, either
it's an ego boost

00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:00.610 align:middle line:84%
or it's a deflation when
you find out that maybe you

00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:04.990 align:middle line:84%
were a chambermaid or
cleaning the toilets

00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:05.990 align:middle line:90%
in some incarnation.

00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:08.400 align:middle line:84%
But now let's look at
some people who were-- we

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:11.040 align:middle line:84%
talked about this earlier, we
mentioned it, touched on it,

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Madison is part of it-- there
are these individuals who

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:18.090 align:middle line:84%
you believe at this time
through the experiments

00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:20.100 align:middle line:84%
and the science
have reincarnated

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:22.520 align:middle line:84%
at this time that were part
of the founding fathers.

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:25.100 align:middle line:84%
Some of the primary founding
fathers of this country.

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Everybody keeps saying where
are they when we need them now?

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:31.500 align:middle line:84%
A When things have
gone a bit astray

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:33.699 align:middle line:84%
from the original
intention it sounds like.

00:48:33.699 --> 00:48:35.490 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Well, I
don't think that-- see,

00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:41.450 align:middle line:84%
I think people expect you
to replay the same role,

00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:44.460 align:middle line:84%
and that's not the way
reincarnation happens.

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:48.880 align:middle line:84%
You come with the same
potential, the same legacy,

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:52.509 align:middle line:84%
the same capacities
and problems.

00:48:52.509 --> 00:48:54.050 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean
that you're going

00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:57.130 align:middle line:84%
to be a president or a leader
or whatever in this lifetime.

00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:58.390 align:middle line:90%
You're doing something else.

00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:00.810 align:middle line:90%
Or you may or may not.

00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:04.119 align:middle line:84%
And it wouldn't work
the way you suggest it.

00:49:04.119 --> 00:49:05.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm sure it wouldn't.

00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: If these same
people were in those positions

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:11.757 align:middle line:84%
today, let me tell you, they
would not be able to cooperate.

00:49:11.757 --> 00:49:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With each other.

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:14.006 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: With each other.

00:49:14.006 --> 00:49:16.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about, if
you don't mind talking about,

00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:18.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big fan of
Thomas Jefferson.

00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:21.290 align:middle line:84%
I was obsessed when
I was in my 20s

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:23.845 align:middle line:84%
with reading biographies
of Thomas Jefferson.

00:49:23.845 --> 00:49:25.800 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't get enough of this.

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.510 align:middle line:84%
It's like I loved
this individual.

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the beings
that you're talking about

00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:36.360 align:middle line:84%
is incarnated at this
time, whose name is Thomas,

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:40.561 align:middle line:84%
it appears to be Thomas
Jefferson in the day.

00:49:40.561 --> 00:49:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And so how, and when you're
looking at the cerebrotype

00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:47.080 align:middle line:84%
or performotype, how does
that display in his life?

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:50.010 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Well, in
all of these cases--

00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does he have a
similar facial appearance?

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:52.790 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:54.414 align:middle line:84%
But there are several
people like that.

00:49:54.414 --> 00:49:57.240 align:middle line:84%
If you ask Jim Tucker at
the University of Virginia,

00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:01.050 align:middle line:84%
"Jim, how many Thomas
Jefferson cases do you have?"

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:03.100 align:middle line:90%
And he says, "Five."

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:05.245 align:middle line:84%
And Jim asks me, he said,
"How many do you have?"

00:50:05.245 --> 00:50:06.779 align:middle line:90%
I said, "I've got four."

00:50:06.779 --> 00:50:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then of course
you have about 1,000 Cleopatras,

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:10.045 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:50:10.045 --> 00:50:10.711 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Yes.

00:50:10.711 --> 00:50:13.219 align:middle line:84%
So there are a lot of
those things, but so--

00:50:13.219 --> 00:50:15.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But is there
any clear indication

00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:17.218 align:middle line:84%
that this one person may
actually carry these traits?

00:50:17.218 --> 00:50:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: Well,
according to my model,

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:24.670 align:middle line:84%
the factors all are
quite good matches.

00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:26.850 align:middle line:84%
But like most of
the cases, I hardly

00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:30.120 align:middle line:84%
ever use anyone's
name because I think

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.240 align:middle line:84%
people who are serious
about this don't really

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:33.244 align:middle line:90%
want to be claiming it.

00:50:33.244 --> 00:50:33.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: You know, some
people are for ego reasons

00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.970 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And some people are willing--
I have a few people who

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:45.070 align:middle line:84%
have given me written permission
to use their names if I want

00:50:45.070 --> 00:50:48.770 align:middle line:84%
to because they feel
that it might help learn.

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:51.067 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right it'll help
others become confident

00:50:51.067 --> 00:50:51.775 align:middle line:90%
and come forward.

00:50:51.775 --> 00:50:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: --that have
that sort of thing.

00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:59.640 align:middle line:84%
But in this case, I have
followed a group of individuals

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.380 align:middle line:84%
that I think are, and I
think other people would

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:03.880 align:middle line:84%
agree with me, that
this is probably

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.201 align:middle line:84%
the likely case
of individuals who

00:51:06.201 --> 00:51:07.450 align:middle line:90%
were active in the Revolution.

00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And they still have the same
antipathies that they had,

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:15.410 align:middle line:84%
they have the same
sort of habits,

00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:19.900 align:middle line:84%
the lack of communication
that they had.

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:22.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we produced
a country out

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.540 align:middle line:84%
of that revolutionary
period, but it

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:27.197 align:middle line:84%
was based on a lot of fighting
and scrabbling around.

00:51:27.197 --> 00:51:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Politics
was as dirty then--

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: --as it was now.

00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:31.590 align:middle line:90%
As it is now.

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And so we wouldn't
want those people

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:36.950 align:middle line:84%
to be in the same
positions again today.

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:38.940 align:middle line:84%
But the people who are
in those positions today

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:42.660 align:middle line:84%
also have their past
life connections

00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:50.005 align:middle line:84%
and so we don't really know what
all their past lives are and so

00:51:50.005 --> 00:51:50.930 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:54.150 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure some of
those same factors

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:58.070 align:middle line:84%
are carried over into this
political campaign in 2012.

00:51:58.070 --> 00:51:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As what was
happening back then.

00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And when we were
speaking off camera,

00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:06.840 align:middle line:84%
you were telling me that
probably the most disappointing

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:10.410 align:middle line:84%
aspect of doing this work
to you, it's very exciting,

00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:12.260 align:middle line:84%
you're certainly
laying a framework

00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:14.200 align:middle line:90%
to start working from in this.

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:18.000 align:middle line:84%
But that once people,
even when people do

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.060 align:middle line:84%
understand what or who they were
in a given time, that things it

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:23.832 align:middle line:90%
don't really change much.

00:52:23.832 --> 00:52:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: They don't.

00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And my whole theory, of course,
as I mentioned to you before

00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:35.200 align:middle line:84%
is that reincarnation is
the function through which

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:39.830 align:middle line:84%
the universe realizes
its conscious evolution.

00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:43.710 align:middle line:84%
We are part of the
Creator's flow of evolution,

00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:45.920 align:middle line:90%
but it's a slow process.

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think that what
we are facing today

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:54.570 align:middle line:84%
is that technology is
going very rapidly,

00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:57.450 align:middle line:84%
change is happening
very rapidly,

00:52:57.450 --> 00:52:59.020 align:middle line:84%
but at the level
of consciousness,

00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:01.200 align:middle line:90%
we're not going at that pace.

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm hoping
is if we could

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.910 align:middle line:84%
have more discussions
like this one

00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:10.160 align:middle line:84%
about how reincarnation
seems to work,

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:13.330 align:middle line:84%
and if people then
said, "Oh, I see.

00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:16.080 align:middle line:84%
This is why I have these
problems, these issues

00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:19.680 align:middle line:84%
with this person, that person,
with myself, et cetera,"

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:22.240 align:middle line:84%
then with that
conscious awareness,

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:25.660 align:middle line:84%
we can speed up the process
of conscious evolution.

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But doesn't
it create, isn't

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:31.630 align:middle line:84%
it driven by a person asking
the question of themselves

00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:34.107 align:middle line:90%
why do I feel this way?

00:53:34.107 --> 00:53:35.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean let's talk about common--

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: You mean to
discover something of the past.

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also
to utilize that.

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:45.540 align:middle line:84%
If we do reincarnate and we go
on this wheel of incarnation,

00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:47.570 align:middle line:84%
this wheel of life
as Amika Swami

00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:51.260 align:middle line:84%
calls it, again and
again, doesn't it

00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:53.960 align:middle line:84%
seem that the opportunity
is simply to grow,

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:55.840 align:middle line:84%
learn, and refine
oneself each time?

00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:58.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's almost
a depressing thought

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:00.820 align:middle line:84%
to think we get stuck
in old behaviors

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:02.080 align:middle line:90%
and never move beyond them.

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.934 align:middle line:84%
So, say, I'm sure
anyone watching this

00:54:03.934 --> 00:54:05.350 align:middle line:84%
would not want to
be in that mode.

00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:06.391 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Right, right.

00:54:06.391 --> 00:54:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how does
one begin engaging

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:12.850 align:middle line:84%
with one's own past and
that process of discovery?

00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: You have to
have a particular world

00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:17.155 align:middle line:90%
view of reality.

00:54:17.155 --> 00:54:21.170 align:middle line:84%
You have to have the
assumption, first of all,

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:26.360 align:middle line:84%
that we have some conscious
control over ourselves.

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:29.700 align:middle line:90%
Our own use of our options.

00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that doesn't come out

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:33.670 align:middle line:90%
of neuroscience.

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:37.160 align:middle line:84%
This is something that has to
come down from the top down

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:40.350 align:middle line:84%
into our thinking about
ourselves and the beliefs

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:41.350 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:54:41.350 --> 00:54:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we need to
talk about reincarnation not

00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:53.710 align:middle line:84%
only at the scientific, sort of,
substantive level of evidence

00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:55.730 align:middle line:84%
and so on; we really
need to talk about it

00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:58.560 align:middle line:84%
in terms of a cosmology
of a self-learning,

00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:03.950 align:middle line:84%
self-experimenting,
self-actualizing, if we want

00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:07.530 align:middle line:84%
to use that term which
came from Abraham Maslow,

00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:09.140 align:middle line:90%
and I think that's what we are.

00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:11.806 align:middle line:90%
We should be self-actualizing.

00:55:11.806 --> 00:55:13.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we can't
just separate ourselves

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:15.960 align:middle line:84%
out from what's happening
on a cosmic level,

00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:19.750 align:middle line:84%
but in sheerly
practical terms, how

00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:22.960 align:middle line:84%
about certain tools such
as hypnosis, past life

00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:24.580 align:middle line:90%
regression, and the like?

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:26.090 align:middle line:90%
Are these things that are--?

00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: These
are useful ways

00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:31.995 align:middle line:84%
to discover more information
about who you are.

00:55:31.995 --> 00:55:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: But then you have
to take the responsibility

00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:39.837 align:middle line:84%
of deciding what you're
going to do with it.

00:55:39.837 --> 00:55:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:42.253 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: And that's
the point I'm making.

00:55:42.253 --> 00:55:44.049 align:middle line:90%
I think a lot of people are--

00:55:44.049 --> 00:55:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can't use it as
an excuse to continue behavior.

00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:48.339 align:middle line:84%
>>VON WARD: You can't
use it as an excuse,

00:55:48.339 --> 00:55:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to offend some
of my regression colleagues

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:56.040 align:middle line:84%
and friends, but sometimes the
person coming to a regression

00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:59.030 align:middle line:84%
therapist thinks that that's
going to be the answer.

00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:01.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm going to
have the regression session

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:02.370 align:middle line:90%
and it'll all be better.

00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And it does help, as we know
in psychological counseling,

00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:08.400 align:middle line:90%
just talking through is helpful.

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:13.014 align:middle line:84%
But at this level
of soul factors,

00:56:13.014 --> 00:56:14.430 align:middle line:84%
you've got to work
on it yourself.

00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:16.054 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've got
to do it ourselves.

00:56:16.054 --> 00:56:19.050 align:middle line:84%
We have to actually engage with
it and also remove the ego.

00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Because the reality is if
we've been around that wheel

00:56:21.370 --> 00:56:23.405 align:middle line:84%
a few times, we've
done some good things,

00:56:23.405 --> 00:56:25.500 align:middle line:84%
we've done some things
we're not very proud of.

00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And we have to just look at it
as a continuum of refinement.

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And I like the word
refinement because, really,

00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:33.700 align:middle line:84%
when it comes down to that,
it's stripping away the blame.

00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you so much
for taking the time

00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:37.720 align:middle line:90%
to come and be with us.

00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:37.940 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: It was a pleasure.

00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:39.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And taking the
time to do all this work.

00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:41.903 align:middle line:84%
I mean The Soul Genome is
a really beautiful book.

00:56:41.903 --> 00:56:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot
more examples in here

00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:45.555 align:middle line:84%
than what we were
able to get to today.

00:56:45.555 --> 00:56:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>>VON WARD: Thank you

00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:47.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Paul.

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.875 align:middle line:84%
Well now, if you would like
to continue your own research

00:56:49.875 --> 00:56:51.520 align:middle line:84%
into this subject,
I highly recommend

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:53.360 align:middle line:90%
that you read The Soul Genome.

00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile supporting material
is available in my interviews

00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:59.830 align:middle line:84%
with Rupert Sheldrake, Bruce
Lipton, and Gary Schwartz,

00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:03.210 align:middle line:84%
all of which you'll find in
the Gaiam TV Conscious Media

00:57:03.210 --> 00:57:04.200 align:middle line:90%
archives.

00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thanks for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:18.834 align:middle line:10%
