>> REGINA MEREDITH: Shakespeare
wrote, "Double, double,

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.830 align:middle line:10%
toil and trouble," as the old
hag stirred her evil brew over

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.160 align:middle line:10%
a boiling cauldron.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.710 align:middle line:84%
She would often throw a frog
into the mix for potency

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.320 align:middle line:84%
before flying off on her
broom to perform her spells.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.800 align:middle line:84%
But where did these
stories come from?

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.400 align:middle line:84%
According to today's
guest, Tom Hatsis,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.880 align:middle line:84%
these tales are based on
folk medicine and the use

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:90%
of entheogens in times past.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Throw a little
misogyny into the mix,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.030 align:middle line:84%
and you have the archetype
of the evil witch.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.970 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.240 align:middle line:90%

you for having me.

"The Witches' Ointment"--
"The Witches' Ointment"

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.080 align:middle line:90%
is the name of the book.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, it begs the
question, how in the world

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.180 align:middle line:84%
did you end up
writing this book?

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And what drew you to these
themes to begin with?

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.440 align:middle line:10%
>>HATSIS: I started
off, I guess,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle line:10%
my studies in
psychedelia, studying

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.810 align:middle line:10%
in the 1960s in my undergrad.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.860 align:middle line:10%
And then for my Masters,
I went into the 1950s.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.130 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go back
a little bit more.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.502 align:middle line:84%
And I essentially just
started going back and back

00:01:27.502 --> 00:01:29.210 align:middle line:84%
and back, and I wanted
to find out, well,

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.810 align:middle line:84%
where were there
some origins to this?

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And some great work had
already been done with regard

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.070 align:middle line:84%
to the Rites of Eleusis,
so I was like, no,

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.160 align:middle line:90%
well that's already there.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And I had come across in Richard
Rudgley's book "The Alchemy

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.310 align:middle line:84%
of Culture" this thing
called the witches' ointment.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh, I want
to find out about this.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.510 align:middle line:84%
But there really wasn't
anything more out there

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.980 align:middle line:84%
as far as a full volume, and
I looked in every bookstore

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:54.970 align:middle line:90%
I could find.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.602 align:middle line:10%
And I just decided,
all right, I'm

00:01:57.602 --> 00:01:59.060 align:middle line:10%
going to have to
write this myself,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.930 align:middle line:10%
because maybe there's somebody
else out there that would

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.030 align:middle line:10%
like to read a book like this.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And now I don't ever want
to read my book again,

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.165 align:middle line:84%
because I've read
it 1,000 times.

00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:08.699 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: [LAUGHING] It's truly
original work, I have to say.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it clarified
a lot of things

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.040 align:middle line:84%
and took the mystery away from
what was actually going on

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.830 align:middle line:84%
and how these tales originated
and also the story of women,

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.960 align:middle line:84%
as I said in the open
just a little bit ago

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.340 align:middle line:90%
and what happened to them.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, let's
start with what you would

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.080 align:middle line:90%
call the witch stereotype.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Sure.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.830 align:middle line:84%
The witch stereotype is the
witch of popular imagination,

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.610 align:middle line:84%
usually a woman,
but sometimes a man,

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.980 align:middle line:84%
but normally a woman who is
part of this large conspiracy

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.950 align:middle line:84%
with other witches
to worship the devil,

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.000 align:middle line:90%
renounce Christianity.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.050 align:middle line:90%
That person did not exist.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.750 align:middle line:84%
What did exist were shamans
and wise women and seers,

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.934 align:middle line:84%
and it appears
that some of them,

00:02:48.934 --> 00:02:50.600 align:middle line:84%
at least through the
research I've done,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.130 align:middle line:84%
were worshipping a
fertility goddess,

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.120 align:middle line:84%
that archetypal great
mother from antiquity.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.990 align:middle line:84%
The worship of this
great mother actually

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.870 align:middle line:84%
survived the fall of Rome
and the rise of Christianity.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And this was at a
time, the 1300s, 1400s,

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.240 align:middle line:84%
where there were only
two forces in the world.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.190 align:middle line:84%
There was God on one
side, God and Jesus,

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.770 align:middle line:90%
and Satan on the other.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.600 align:middle line:84%
So if it wasn't God and Jesus,
it was defaulted to Satan.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And when you read
the text, you can

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.735 align:middle line:84%
read theologians
talking about how

00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:22.360 align:middle line:84%
they worshipped this
fertility goddess,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.550 align:middle line:90%
but she's really the devil.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.120 align:middle line:84%
So they were demonizing what
these people were actually

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.920 align:middle line:90%
doing.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.060 align:middle line:84%
They were having
entheogenic experiences,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.249 align:middle line:84%
but that was just not
cool with the church.

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, not cool at all.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.191 align:middle line:84%
OK, so there's a series of
books out by Deborah Harkness.

00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:40.440 align:middle line:90%
And I forget the name of them.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.010 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with witches and
warlocks and vampires and all

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.480 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And I met her briefly,
and I was curious

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.489 align:middle line:84%
mostly about the way she
went about her research,

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.530 align:middle line:84%
because she actually did
quite a bit of research.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.930 align:middle line:90%
Where did you do this?

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.830 align:middle line:84%
How did you find most
of your material?

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.370 align:middle line:90%
Where did it take you?

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.960 align:middle line:90%
This is pretty esoteric.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Archives-- archives
in Italy, archives in England,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.940 align:middle line:84%
some archives in America,
Tulane University, for example,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.730 align:middle line:84%
overseas University of
Milano, the Comune Di Todi,

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.620 align:middle line:90%
different places like that.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Like I said before, there
wasn't really a volume yet

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.300 align:middle line:90%
that went into this.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.730 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't have too
much to go on of what

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:20.959 align:middle line:90%
was already written about it.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.940 align:middle line:84%
So I had to go straight
to the sources.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.080 align:middle line:84%
I ended up having to
interrupt my research

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.617 align:middle line:84%
because I got to this point
where everything was in Latin.

00:04:28.617 --> 00:04:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was just
going to ask you that.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.380 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't it all in Latin?

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: It was all
in Latin, so that's

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.040 align:middle line:84%
why it took me nine
years to write it.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I had to interrupt it,
teach myself Latin just so

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.770 align:middle line:90%
that I could continue the work.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what I was wondering.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.170 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that, but
it made perfect sense.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.500 align:middle line:90%
I thought it had to have been.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.000 align:middle line:90%
So you actually learned Latin?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yes.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.970 align:middle line:90%
I learned how to read it.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And by that, I mean that
like, with a good dictionary,

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.940 align:middle line:84%
I could make my
way through a text.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, force your
way through a sentence or two.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.000 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
amazing dedication.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: You know, yes, it was.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:58.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it was.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.870 align:middle line:90%
Take credit for it.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.866 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now, when we talk
about the witch stereotype,

00:05:02.866 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:84%
it gets into the witches'
ointment, which you

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.948 align:middle line:90%
mentioned a little while ago.

00:05:05.948 --> 00:05:07.810 align:middle line:90%
What is the witches' ointment?

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: The witches'
ointment is essentially

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:84%
a stereotype of an entheogenic
ointment, in the same sense

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.190 align:middle line:84%
that during the 1930s
with the "Reefer Madness,"

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.220 align:middle line:84%
they didn't want to portray
in anti-marijuana films

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.780 align:middle line:84%
that marijuana pretty
much just makes

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.370 align:middle line:84%
you want to play music and
have fun with people and paint.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.328 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And overeat.

00:05:25.328 --> 00:05:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah,
overeat, exactly.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.310 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to portray it
as this demonic thing that

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.250 align:middle line:84%
will turn you insane
and make you a murderer.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, the witches' ointment was
by and large the same thing.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.270 align:middle line:84%
It was this way of demonizing
this entheogenic practice

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.130 align:middle line:84%
of worshiping
fertility goddesses,

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.570 align:middle line:84%
that archetypal great mother,
to go back to that again.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.640 align:middle line:84%
She went by many different
names all over Western Europe.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And the witches' ointment is
the outcome of the stereotype.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.910 align:middle line:84%
There were all these different
ingredients, so to speak,

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.430 align:middle line:84%
that went into the
stereotypical witch.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.760 align:middle line:90%
This was the latest one.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.900 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the last
ones to actually enter,

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.740 align:middle line:84%
because there was a debate
amongst theologians like, OK,

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.380 align:middle line:84%
we know, of course--
we "know" that women

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.484 align:middle line:90%
are flying to the devil.

00:06:08.484 --> 00:06:09.775 align:middle line:90%
We know that this is happening.

00:06:09.775 --> 00:06:11.233 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Molesting
men at night--

00:06:11.233 --> 00:06:12.884 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about that
later. [LAUGHING]

00:06:12.884 --> 00:06:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: But no one's ever
seen this happen before.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.154 align:middle line:84%
So since we know it's going
on but no one has seen it--

00:06:18.154 --> 00:06:19.820 align:middle line:84%
so there was this
whole debate about it,

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.785 align:middle line:84%
and they developed what
was called a crimine

00:06:21.785 --> 00:06:24.660 align:middle line:84%
dell'anima, which means
a crime of the soul.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.072 align:middle line:84%
So because these were
entheogenic ointments,

00:06:27.072 --> 00:06:29.280 align:middle line:84%
it's like, yeah, well,
they're not flying corporeally

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:90%
through the air.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.790 align:middle line:84%
They're flying
with their spirit.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.050 align:middle line:90%
And that's a crime.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And that became the
witch's ointment.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.710 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about these
women and who they were.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you mentioned this
several times in the book,

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.180 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of these women were
ultimately burned at the stake,

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.920 align:middle line:90%
which-hunted.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.730 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of these
women were simply

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.070 align:middle line:84%
wise women, as you
mentioned, but also

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.290 align:middle line:84%
very highly skilled
herbologist and healers,

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.450 align:middle line:84%
the ones that we've
been calling witches.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
culture and the use

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.160 align:middle line:84%
of these women and
their skills in that day

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.780 align:middle line:84%
and why people turned to
them versus the medically

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.750 align:middle line:90%
trained doctors and such.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to take some
time to explain this for us.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.010 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Sure.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.820 align:middle line:84%
By and large, it had to
do with fiscal pragmatism.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Most people could not afford a
university-trained physician.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Also, the people
in rural villages

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:29.650 align:middle line:84%
had certain problems in life
that were just not found

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.210 align:middle line:90%
so much in the larger cities.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.657 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Such as?

00:07:33.657 --> 00:07:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Let's see.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.000 align:middle line:90%
What would be something?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Just certain superstitions
about what was going on,

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.850 align:middle line:84%
for example, the idea that the
clause of your pain or ailment

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:49.330 align:middle line:84%
was done by a spirit of
sorts-- you could find that

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.550 align:middle line:84%
in some university-trained
physician labs

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and what have you, but a lot of
them were a lot more practical.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.830 align:middle line:84%
It just had to do with going to
somebody that was on your level

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.990 align:middle line:84%
and seeing somebody
that was closer to you

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.094 align:middle line:84%
and that you can
pay not so much to.

00:08:04.094 --> 00:08:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So these women
understand the local

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.222 align:middle line:84%
superstitions in
addition to their craft.

00:08:08.222 --> 00:08:09.430 align:middle line:90%
They understood these things.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yes, and it's kind
of difficult to describe what

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.490 align:middle line:84%
those local superstitions were,
because all we have are records

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.040 align:middle line:84%
left from people
demonizing them,

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.500 align:middle line:84%
but certain ideas like
picking certain plants

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and dancing around them to
procure the love of somebody,

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.390 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:31.460 align:middle line:84%
You had certain guys like Martin
de Arliss, who would say, oh,

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.368 align:middle line:90%
that's ridiculous.

00:08:33.368 --> 00:08:35.409 align:middle line:84%
It's not dancing around
the plant that caused it.

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:38.710 align:middle line:84%
There are medicinal
properties in the plant.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.370 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense,
that was like, well,

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.230 align:middle line:84%
these people didn't
realize that.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.440 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't universal education
yet or universal literacy

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.680 align:middle line:84%
or anything, so they had
their own superstitions

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.630 align:middle line:90%
about what was ailing them.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And so they'd see a
wise woman instead.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.810 align:middle line:84%
In Italy, for example, a
pretty popular prescription

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:04.576 align:middle line:84%
had to do with
abused housewives.

00:09:04.576 --> 00:09:08.130 align:middle line:84%
These abused housewives
would sometimes seek out

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.550 align:middle line:84%
a [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],
which is just a wise woman.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And she would sell them some
kind of psychoactive drug.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And they would slip the
drug to their husband

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.890 align:middle line:84%
and wait 45 minutes,
an hour, then

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.010 align:middle line:84%
start saying an
incantation over them.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And then when the psychic
effects kicked in,

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.280 align:middle line:84%
the abusive husband
would think his wife now

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.180 align:middle line:84%
had this power over him,
and he would behave himself

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.530 align:middle line:90%
from that day forward.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:34.040 align:middle line:84%
So in a lot of ways, you would
go to a wise woman for that

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.150 align:middle line:84%
because if you were to
go to like an educated

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.730 align:middle line:84%
male physician, he'd tell
you to just deal with it.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:39.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Deal with it.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.240 align:middle line:90%
It's all in your head anyway.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Just
deal with it, yeah.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:41.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Be a better wife.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.571 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're obviously
not pleasing your husband,

00:09:44.571 --> 00:09:46.290 align:middle line:90%
so that's the problem.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well,
no, this guy's a real--

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.612 align:middle line:90%
I guess I can't curse, but--

00:09:50.612 --> 00:09:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: He's a jerk.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:52.486 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: He's a jerk.

00:09:52.486 --> 00:09:53.310 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:54.969 align:middle line:84%
He's a jerk, and
this is how you're

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:56.010 align:middle line:90%
going to get back at him.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.885 align:middle line:84%
And you're not just
going to get back at him,

00:09:57.885 --> 00:10:01.090 align:middle line:84%
but you're going to do something
so he thinks that any time he

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.072 align:middle line:84%
misbehaves, you could
just say this incantation,

00:10:04.072 --> 00:10:05.280 align:middle line:90%
and it's going to cause him--

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:05.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Cast a spell.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah,
in the same sense.

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:08.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you were to slip
something like LSD to somebody

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:11.710 align:middle line:84%
and not tell them and
then start saying it

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.510 align:middle line:84%
like-- they might actually think
that you were causing that.

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people would go
to these wise women instead.

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.144 align:middle line:84%
They understood
just your plight.

00:10:23.144 --> 00:10:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The
complexity of life.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.740 align:middle line:90%
They understood all of it.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.115 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah,
exactly, exactly.

00:10:27.115 --> 00:10:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
having women issues,

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.850 align:middle line:84%
well, it would be better to go
to a woman who understands that

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:35.900 align:middle line:90%
than to a male physician.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The other thing is
these women were under a lot

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:44.490 align:middle line:84%
of pressure, because, again,
these were misogynistic times.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And these women had actual
power actual, actual knowledge.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.380 align:middle line:84%
They had an actual
place in society

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.890 align:middle line:84%
that was not appreciated
by the church,

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.670 align:middle line:84%
nor by the scientific
community of the day, right?

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Depending
on where you were.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.150 align:middle line:84%
It's odd to think about, because
you take a place like England,

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.540 align:middle line:84%
then yes, everything you
said is 100% correct.

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Italy, for example, was
a little differently.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:11.090 align:middle line:84%
This wasn't really illegal
until the witch stereotype

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about a moment
ago really came into play.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.190 align:middle line:84%
But one of the wise
women I write about,

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:19.752 align:middle line:84%
Matteuccia de Francesco, La
Strega de Casa di Ripabianca.

00:11:19.752 --> 00:11:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're
talking about her.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.344 align:middle line:90%
I won't say her name.

00:11:22.344 --> 00:11:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: She
completely-- I mean,

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:29.040 align:middle line:84%
she did all this work, all this
healing with complete immunity

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.301 align:middle line:90%
until the witch stereotype.

00:11:30.301 --> 00:11:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right, right.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.257 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's talk about what
happened when-- so people would

00:11:34.257 --> 00:11:35.090 align:middle line:90%
turn to these women.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:84%
They had a huge
responsibility because

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.740 align:middle line:84%
of the way they were viewed,
oftentimes, as in England,

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.210 align:middle line:90%
for example, in society.

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:46.440 align:middle line:84%
If they screwed up or if a
person was simply too far gone

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.730 align:middle line:84%
and died after their care,
let's talk a little bit

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.890 align:middle line:84%
about what happened and
how these women were

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.630 align:middle line:84%
demonized in the wake of, say,
a death of one of their clients.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Sure.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:84%
It's odd, because in
some cases-- I mean,

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.330 align:middle line:84%
people died all the
time for various reasons

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.390 align:middle line:90%
back in the day.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And it really depends
on what time and place

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.410 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Take, let's say for
example, Bavaria.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.070 align:middle line:84%
In I think it was
1050 there were people

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.090 align:middle line:90%
that burned three wise women.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And the church had
nothing to do with it.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:22.440 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the church
condemned the practice.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.360 align:middle line:84%
It was just the regular--
her neighbors that did it.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think in 1279, the clergy
actually intervened in Alsace,

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.774 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was, in France,
the villagers were going

00:12:35.774 --> 00:12:37.940 align:middle line:84%
to burn this woman, and the
clergy came in and said,

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.115 align:middle line:90%
no, you can't do this.

00:12:39.115 --> 00:12:39.950 align:middle line:90%
This is insane.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:41.360 align:middle line:90%
She didn't have anything to do.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.700 align:middle line:90%
She tried to help you.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.970 align:middle line:84%
We don't have too many records
about what common life was

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:50.490 align:middle line:90%
like until the 1300s, 1400s.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's where,
unfortunately, the only reason

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.920 align:middle line:84%
the spotlight was
shined on these people

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.876 align:middle line:84%
was because of the
witch stereotype.

00:12:57.876 --> 00:13:01.160 align:middle line:84%
But before that, I mean, again,
these people by and large--

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.040 align:middle line:84%
some of them were
actually even licensed.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.620 align:middle line:84%
In France, you could be
licensed as a healer.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.980 align:middle line:90%
And they handed those out.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.810 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],
although she was a midwife,

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.220 align:middle line:84%
she got into a little
bit of trouble,

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.020 align:middle line:84%
and it was actually the fact
that she was so respected

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:22.652 align:middle line:84%
in her community, actually in
Paris, that she was set free.

00:13:22.652 --> 00:13:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:24.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, it's odd.

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So, I mean, like
everything in the times,

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:28.300 align:middle line:90%
we don't have a clear picture.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And everything is highly
nuanced, depending on--

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Case by case basis.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:32.235 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Case by case basis.

00:13:32.235 --> 00:13:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yes, absolutely.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.255 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But one of
the things that seems--

00:13:35.255 --> 00:13:38.190 align:middle line:84%
as I was reading your book,
it came up a few times,

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.380 align:middle line:84%
that was frowned
upon by the men--

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and you touched
on it a bit ago--

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.622 align:middle line:90%
was the use of love filters.

00:13:44.622 --> 00:13:46.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: It wasn't always
frowned upon by men.

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No?

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Only if it worked to their
advantage. [LAUGHING]

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.106 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Well, it depended.

00:13:50.106 --> 00:13:51.555 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was frowned upon.

00:13:51.555 --> 00:13:52.430 align:middle line:90%
One of the problems--

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:54.513 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Talk about love
filters, what they are,

00:13:54.513 --> 00:13:56.850 align:middle line:84%
how they were induced,
and then the rest of this.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Sure.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.330 align:middle line:90%
We today would call it ecstasy.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.215 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Latin
is "pocula amatori."

00:14:02.215 --> 00:14:03.850 align:middle line:90%
It just means love cup.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.110 align:middle line:84%
But if we were to
translate it directly--

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:07.360 align:middle line:90%
that's a direct translation.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.110 align:middle line:84%
If you add just the
nuance of language

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:10.800 align:middle line:84%
and how it changes
and adjust for it,

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.600 align:middle line:84%
we would call pocula
amatori "ecstasy."

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And both women
and men took them.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.670 align:middle line:84%
One of the main
ingredients was mandrake.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you'd
find opium in there

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.160 align:middle line:84%
as well, depending
on if the filter came

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.387 align:middle line:84%
from a place near a town that
had an apothecary or not.

00:14:26.387 --> 00:14:27.970 align:middle line:84%
It was just something--
it was like we

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.350 align:middle line:90%
would call recreational drug.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they worked,
sometimes they didn't.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.826 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I thought
the point was to-- for some

00:14:36.826 --> 00:14:39.450 align:middle line:84%
of the women that got in trouble
for doing this was simply that

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.550 align:middle line:84%
they were trying to invoke a
spell where a man would fall

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:43.600 align:middle line:90%
in love with them.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Sure, at times.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.660 align:middle line:84%
But again, it depends
on what that person

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:48.990 align:middle line:90%
wanted to use the filter for.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find the same
ingredients as a love filter

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:84%
as you'll find in like
an anti-lust potion.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.160 align:middle line:84%
They would try to
actually like--

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.301 align:middle line:84%
if somebody was
just like too horny,

00:14:58.301 --> 00:14:59.800 align:middle line:84%
you would find the
same ingredients.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So, much of it had to do
with the intent of the user.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.740 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, you'll have
the same ingredients used

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.700 align:middle line:84%
for different ends, and
as long as the person

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.660 align:middle line:84%
believed that that end was
going to be the outcome, usually

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.240 align:middle line:84%
that would be the outcome,
although sometimes people

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.410 align:middle line:84%
would drink these
love filters and die.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
you'd have a problem.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:22.042 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, it really depended.

00:15:22.042 --> 00:15:24.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was one of the
more interesting things I found

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.840 align:middle line:84%
through my research, was
just how much of a variety

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.940 align:middle line:90%
there was, really.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.800 align:middle line:84%
I went in just looking
for a flying ointment,

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.790 align:middle line:84%
and I just delved
into this whole world

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.890 align:middle line:84%
of all these different--
all these other uses for all

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:38.350 align:middle line:84%
these different
potions, powders,

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:39.804 align:middle line:90%
ointments, fumigations.

00:15:39.804 --> 00:15:41.220 align:middle line:84%
People weren't
rolling blunts yet.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.020 align:middle line:84%
They were throwing the
herb of choice on to coals

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.210 align:middle line:84%
and heating them up and inhaling
them, usually to prophesy.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:50.600 align:middle line:84%
But going back to love
filters, so much of it depends.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Other times, there was--
you might accidentally

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:54.810 align:middle line:90%
kill yourself.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:57.600 align:middle line:84%
One guy drank a love
filter and actually just

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.210 align:middle line:84%
was so intoxicated by it he
fell onto his sword and died.

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:03.910 align:middle line:90%
I read that.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:05.618 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: And we don't
know what happened

00:16:05.618 --> 00:16:08.100 align:middle line:84%
to the person who
sold it to him,

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.500 align:middle line:90%
but again, it really depends.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.070 align:middle line:84%
You have another
guy named Lamullis,

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.750 align:middle line:84%
who I write about
in the book who

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:19.220 align:middle line:84%
was tortured for the
death of the queen's son

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.250 align:middle line:90%
at the time, Queen Fredegund.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And when they got out
of him in the torture

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.240 align:middle line:84%
that he got these
love filters and love

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.470 align:middle line:84%
potions from these witches,
they didn't care at all.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.636 align:middle line:84%
They're like, oh, yeah,
well, that's what people do.

00:16:31.636 --> 00:16:33.030 align:middle line:90%
We don't care about that.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.082 align:middle line:90%
Why did this kid die?

00:16:34.082 --> 00:16:35.290 align:middle line:90%
That's what they cared about.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly,
you're not only

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:41.420 align:middle line:84%
having to look at it
geographically location

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.160 align:middle line:84%
by location and how
it was utilized,

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.540 align:middle line:84%
but all of the
superstitions of those given

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.310 align:middle line:84%
areas and the beliefs
of those areas.

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, these
tended to interact

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.850 align:middle line:84%
with the prevailing
belief or superstition

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:54.550 align:middle line:90%
of the day in that area, right?

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Exactly, exactly.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And just by the
many different names

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:01.700 align:middle line:84%
of like that archetypal
great mother, for example,

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.730 align:middle line:84%
you see how much there
were differences,

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.569 align:middle line:84%
I mean, nuanced differences,
so much so that they

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.170 align:middle line:90%
had to invent the stereotype.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Because when they were writing
about-- when chroniclers

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.540 align:middle line:84%
finally started caring
about this stuff, I mean,

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.069 align:middle line:90%
it was kind of like what I saw.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:21.180 align:middle line:84%
There was this world of magic
and spell-casting going on,

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.210 align:middle line:84%
so they invented this
stereotype to just say,

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:26.498 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, we're
defaulting it to this.

00:17:26.498 --> 00:17:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mhm, mhm.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Now let's get back
to the frogs being

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:34.680 align:middle line:84%
tossed into the cauldron
in the fairytales.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.490 align:middle line:90%
Frog toxin is back, right?

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.157 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: In some
cases, yes, it's back.

00:17:39.157 --> 00:17:40.781 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk
about frog toxin.

00:17:40.781 --> 00:17:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Why were they using frogs?

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Frogs by and large
were used more for homicide.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.100 align:middle line:84%
But I found a few
specific cases where

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.600 align:middle line:84%
they could have been
used as entheogens,

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.710 align:middle line:90%
which was interesting.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know what kind
of frogs they were using

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and what one was against
the other, because most

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:01.100 align:middle line:84%
of the records,
again, didn't even

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.690 align:middle line:84%
care to record the different
kinds of drugs used.

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:07.580 align:middle line:84%
They just called it vene,
which, depending on context

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.230 align:middle line:90%
means poison or drug.

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.420 align:middle line:90%
We get "venom" from "vene."

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:15.090 align:middle line:90%
And so again, it's odd.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:17.460 align:middle line:84%
If you have somebody,
who, if they wanted

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.030 align:middle line:84%
to try to murder somebody,
they would just fill up--

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.450 align:middle line:84%
in one case, a guy cut up
a frog, got the poisons,

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.370 align:middle line:84%
and put it into the
Eucharist, because he

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.020 align:middle line:90%
was trying to kill a priest.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.250 align:middle line:90%
And the priest drank from the--

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Did he die?

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:32.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: He almost died.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.220 align:middle line:84%
He spent a couple days
in excruciating pain,

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.430 align:middle line:90%
and he eventually was OK.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.160 align:middle line:84%
But in many other cases,
the person did die.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.330 align:middle line:84%
So what's interesting
is they must

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.060 align:middle line:84%
have known that
different frogs-- one is

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.260 align:middle line:90%
too strong a poison.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.290 align:middle line:90%
It's going to kill you.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.630 align:middle line:84%
The other with just
the right amount

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:55.350 align:middle line:84%
will actually have what we would
call an entheogenic experience.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:19:00.450 align:middle line:84%
For example, Billia la
Castagna in northern Italy,

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.680 align:middle line:84%
she apparently had
access to a kind of toad

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.305 align:middle line:84%
that caused what we would call
an entheogenic experience.

00:19:06.305 --> 00:19:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they didn't called
it entheogenic at the time.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.355 align:middle line:84%
They called it a
ceremonial or ritual thing.

00:19:11.355 --> 00:19:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So one of the
interesting things is frog

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.590 align:middle line:90%
medicine is back.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:15.960 align:middle line:90%
I said that earlier.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.140 align:middle line:84%
I know someone who
helps administer

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:22.680 align:middle line:84%
this shamanic-style to people
as a super immune-system boost.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yes.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.568 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Almost like
bee stings or something.

00:19:25.568 --> 00:19:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Again, who knows what-- I
don't know the variety of frog.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:32.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: I don't know much of
the variety of frog, either.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I went looking
into it as far as like

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:37.340 align:middle line:84%
the European toads
and things like that,

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.380 align:middle line:84%
and there were just
so many of them.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, there wasn't any
kind of proper classification

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.190 align:middle line:90%
for such things yet.

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Again, most of the time,
they'll just write-- really,

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:53.540 align:middle line:84%
the word they use the
most is the [INAUDIBLE],

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:56.160 align:middle line:84%
which is just the
excrement of frogs.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I interviewed
a man named Dr.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:01.750 align:middle line:84%
John Rush a while back, and
he talked about mushrooms,

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:05.930 align:middle line:84%
magic mushrooms, and their use
throughout history and also

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:07.814 align:middle line:84%
used as icons in
artwork all over.

00:20:07.814 --> 00:20:09.230 align:middle line:84%
But we just didn't
understand what

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:11.850 align:middle line:84%
those lovely little
polka-dotted caps were.

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And he speaks about Hildegard
von Bingen for example,

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.850 align:middle line:84%
that she was also a
master herbologist.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And she had these
amazing visions,

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.780 align:middle line:84%
did this amazing
artwork, amazing music.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.406 align:middle line:84%
And he was suggesting
that perhaps she

00:20:26.406 --> 00:20:27.780 align:middle line:84%
was one of these
women using some

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:31.170 align:middle line:84%
of these entheogens herself to
inspire this-- well, this very

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:32.220 align:middle line:90%
inspired thought.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.100 align:middle line:10%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.330 align:middle line:90%
I disagree with that.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Do you?

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yes,
because there were

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.820 align:middle line:90%
no laws against doing this.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.240 align:middle line:10%
So one of the
interesting things,

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.620 align:middle line:10%
when you go into the
records, is actually

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:48.200 align:middle line:10%
how open people who were using
these things that could write

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.230 align:middle line:10%
were about the fact that
they were using them.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:53.514 align:middle line:90%
So I disagree there, because--

00:20:53.514 --> 00:20:55.305 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: She would
have written about it?

00:20:55.305 --> 00:20:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: She would have
said, oh, yeah, I took opium,

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.240 align:middle line:90%
and I had this vision.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.812 align:middle line:90%
And she doesn't anywhere.

00:20:59.812 --> 00:21:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Even though
the church was involved?

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:03.010 align:middle line:90%
She would have--

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.442 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: The church-- there
was no war on drugs yet.

00:21:05.442 --> 00:21:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's true.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.350 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get
into that, yes.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.600 align:middle line:10%
>>HATSIS: John Rush is kind
of projecting modern ideas

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.370 align:middle line:10%
onto the past a lot.

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:14.930 align:middle line:90%
There was no Nancy Reagan.

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:17.930 align:middle line:90%
There was no "Just Say No."

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Even after the witch
stereotype, people

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.980 align:middle line:90%
wrote openly about drug use.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:26.970 align:middle line:84%
There's one guy who wrote
in the 1500s about a friend

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.780 align:middle line:84%
he had who would drink
a hallucinogenic potion

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and pretend he was a duck and
just walk around town all day.

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:36.570 align:middle line:10%
And this man, actually, and
Jean Baptist Della Porta

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.270 align:middle line:10%
also wrote about the
witches' ointment,

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:40.830 align:middle line:10%
and he was accused of
witchcraft for doing that

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.740 align:middle line:10%
in his book "Natural Magic."

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And later on, I mean, to
kind of end the scandal,

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.970 align:middle line:84%
he pulled out anything
about the witches' ointment

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.490 align:middle line:90%
but left all the drug use.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:53.570 align:middle line:84%
All the regular drug
use is still there.

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:55.890 align:middle line:84%
There was no laws
against doing drugs.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:22:00.730 align:middle line:84%
There was a church law against
taking them entheogenically

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:03.330 align:middle line:90%
to worship a fertility goddess.

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:04.460 align:middle line:90%
That was the problem.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.377 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think Rush
is correct there at all.

00:22:06.377 --> 00:22:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, thank
you for sharing that.

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:09.240 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.710 align:middle line:84%
So maybe we should go
back to Matteuccia.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:13.730 align:middle line:84%
I can't even begin
to say her name.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:14.813 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: I said it wrong.

00:22:14.813 --> 00:22:18.580 align:middle line:10%
It was funny, because I called
her "Mattiochia" for years

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.700 align:middle line:10%
and years, and then I
spoke to this great scholar

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.120 align:middle line:10%
at Boston College,
Franco Mormando,

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.029 align:middle line:10%
and I'm on the phone with
him, and I said, yeah,

00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:27.820 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to talk to
you about "Mattiochia."

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And he just said,
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.080 align:middle line:90%
"Mattocha!"

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Matteuccia, yeah.

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: It means Darling
Little Female Matthew.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Her parents named
her after Matthew

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:40.600 align:middle line:84%
from the Gospel of Matthew,
but they feminized it.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So this
was a powerful woman.

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about her practice,
her successes, and ultimately

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:49.560 align:middle line:90%
her end as well.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:50.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Sure.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.219 align:middle line:90%
She was a wise woman.

00:22:52.219 --> 00:22:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
let's set the stage,

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.194 align:middle line:84%
the time and where
she came from.

00:22:55.194 --> 00:22:56.110 align:middle line:90%
Tell us all about her.

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Sure.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:23:00.640 align:middle line:10%
She lived in Todi,
which is in Italy.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.910 align:middle line:10%
And she was a wise woman.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.660 align:middle line:10%
She was one of those
women who sold drugs

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:10.220 align:middle line:10%
to abused wives to cast
spells on their husbands,

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.680 align:middle line:10%
along with other
things like love magic

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:16.070 align:middle line:10%
to break up engagements
or various-- I

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:18.580 align:middle line:10%
mean, all different
kinds of things.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.730 align:middle line:10%
I'm trying to say off the
top like some of the stuff

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:24.800 align:middle line:10%
that she was accused of later.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean at the time that she
was doing this, she was fine.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she also
had magical cures.

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:31.580 align:middle line:90%
She specialized in love magic.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And I want to be clear
that not all of her spells

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.340 align:middle line:84%
and not all of magic relied
on these kinds of drugs.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.420 align:middle line:84%
It was just if somebody
knew about them,

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.400 align:middle line:84%
it was how they fit them into
the broader spectrum of magic

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and what is now
called witchcraft.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.740 align:middle line:90%
But she was important.

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:55.310 align:middle line:84%
She served a large benefit
to people in the community

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:59.480 align:middle line:84%
with her different healing
spells, things like that.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.540 align:middle line:10%
And the problem was that there
was a preacher who came around

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:09.280 align:middle line:10%
just as the witch stereotype
was kind of crystallizing,

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.860 align:middle line:10%
Bernardino of Sienna.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:16.550 align:middle line:84%
He had decided in a statute of
laws that these kinds of acts

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:20.520 align:middle line:84%
constituted this conspiratorial
idea of witchcraft.

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was only then that
people came forward and said,

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.790 align:middle line:84%
oh, well-- her neighbors
started to turn on her.

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:31.180 align:middle line:84%
So in this particular
case, you can actually

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:35.650 align:middle line:84%
watch the church authority
convincing the public

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:37.910 align:middle line:90%
that these actions are evil.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And so the neighbors then
said, oh, well, you've

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.320 align:middle line:84%
got to check out Matteuccia
de Francesco because she

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.100 align:middle line:90%
knows how to do all this stuff.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere in her confession,
it's really interesting,

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:54.650 align:middle line:84%
because you can actually see
the witch stereotype foisted

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:55.450 align:middle line:90%
on her.

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this is one of
the clearest cases you came

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:57.760 align:middle line:90%
across.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.470 align:middle line:90%
It was documented.

00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.742 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yes.

00:24:58.742 --> 00:25:01.010 align:middle line:84%
It was probably the
clearest case I came across.

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:04.880 align:middle line:84%
There were all these
just descriptions

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.135 align:middle line:84%
of local magic, sometimes
just common sorcery,

00:25:08.135 --> 00:25:09.500 align:middle line:90%
it could be called.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And then towards the
end, all of a sudden

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:16.240 align:middle line:84%
she's accused of rubbing
these ointments on herself

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.434 align:middle line:84%
and flying off to
meet the devil.

00:25:18.434 --> 00:25:19.350 align:middle line:90%
And it was like, whoa.

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And when you read
the writing, there

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:22.740 align:middle line:90%
was this major shift in tone.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like,
whoa, wait a minute.

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And in the actual
record itself, you're

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:28.980 align:middle line:84%
watching it being
forced out of her mouth

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.500 align:middle line:84%
because she was tortured
to say that she did it.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.290 align:middle line:90%
And that was a big problem.

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And so her record
is-- it's very sad.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:39.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's unfortunate to read.

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:40.740 align:middle line:90%
It's tragic to read.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:45.040 align:middle line:84%
But it also is this
huge light into how

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:50.540 align:middle line:84%
this witch stereotype was just
riveted on to these wise women.

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Did I understand correctly
in reading the book

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.530 align:middle line:84%
that it was thought
or it was indicated

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:59.910 align:middle line:84%
that she may have taken
some of her own potions

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:02.530 align:middle line:84%
during the trial to withstand
the torture they were putting

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:03.375 align:middle line:90%
her through in part?

00:26:03.375 --> 00:26:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Oh, I don't know if
she took them during the trial.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.040 align:middle line:90%
There were cases--

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: After?

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well, I mean, after
the trial she was in chains,

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.520 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't--

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, I didn't know
if was reading that correctly.

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Although there
are some cases of that.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Later on a physician
named Johann Ware

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:25.100 align:middle line:84%
actually writes about
how a friend he knows

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.630 align:middle line:84%
was accused of witchcraft,
and he gave him

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:30.550 align:middle line:84%
a whole lot of opium to
help withstand the torture.

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:33.800 align:middle line:84%
The guy actually
ended up overdosing.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.259 align:middle line:90%
So that is correct.

00:26:35.259 --> 00:26:36.300 align:middle line:90%
That absolutely happened.

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.742 align:middle line:90%
But in the case of Matteuccia.

00:26:37.742 --> 00:26:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Not necessarily.

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:40.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well, it might
have, but it's just not

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:41.290 align:middle line:90%
there in the record.

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:42.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, OK,
that's what I wanted to--

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.726 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: But it's possible.

00:26:43.726 --> 00:26:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's get into
this stereotype of witches

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:50.140 align:middle line:84%
flying on brooms and
witches lying in the middle

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:53.730 align:middle line:84%
of the night to do
just God-awful things.

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:55.370 align:middle line:84%
It's horrible what
they were accused

00:26:55.370 --> 00:27:00.120 align:middle line:84%
of, and even of defiling good
men in the middle of the night,

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.010 align:middle line:84%
flying to them and defiling good
men in the middle of the night.

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Talk about what they
were accused of.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:07.350 align:middle line:10%
>>HATSIS: Mostly
they were accused--

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:09.500 align:middle line:10%
the stereotype
begins with the idea

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.710 align:middle line:10%
that they were flying
to different places

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:15.980 align:middle line:10%
to kill children and
steal their remains.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was really easy because--
so, Matteuccia is in Todi,

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and let's say somebody dies
in Friuli in Italy up north.

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well, how
did Matteuccia do this?

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:29.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, she must have, you know,
rubbed one of those ointments

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.440 align:middle line:84%
on her and in spirit flown
there and killed the child.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And it more had to do
with explaining that.

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.480 align:middle line:84%
That idea became
flying to the devil,

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.310 align:middle line:84%
where she would
renounce Christianity.

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:45.670 align:middle line:84%
They would put a large
cross in front of her feet,

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:49.052 align:middle line:84%
and she'd piss on it and spit
on and stamp on it-- hopefully

00:27:49.052 --> 00:27:51.010 align:middle line:84%
not in that order,
hopefully not in that order.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully she stamped on it
first and then peed on it.

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:54.382 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:27:54.382 --> 00:27:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: This was the lore.

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: This was the
lore, of the course.

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.300 align:middle line:84%
She would also learn how to
perform maleficium, which

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.420 align:middle line:84%
is evil magic, like
making men impotent

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:08.470 align:middle line:84%
or making women miscarry
if they were pregnant

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:11.910 align:middle line:84%
or killing cattle or raising
storms to destroy crops.

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:13.650 align:middle line:10%
Should would also
fornicate with demons

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:16.326 align:middle line:10%
while she was there, apparently.

00:28:16.326 --> 00:28:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The church
had a rich imagination.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: They did, they did.

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What they
heaped on these women.

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, and that's why
I when I hear sometimes, oh,

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:23.550 align:middle line:84%
the church covered
up, covered up-- no,

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.591 align:middle line:84%
you've obviously never
read any of these records,

00:28:25.591 --> 00:28:29.580 align:middle line:84%
because they wrote the most
ridiculous, grotesque things

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.540 align:middle line:90%
you could imagine.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.340 align:middle line:84%
They really weren't trying
to cover anything up.

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.900 align:middle line:84%
They were saying
this is very evil,

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:37.670 align:middle line:90%
what these people are doing.

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:40.170 align:middle line:84%
The idea, though, that they
were meeting up with Satan

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:43.460 align:middle line:84%
actually stems from an earlier
stereotype about heretics

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.040 align:middle line:90%
and what heretics engaged in.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, let's
talk about that.

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:46.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Sure.

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And going back to the
Roman times and the breakaway

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:56.122 align:middle line:84%
of the Christians from the
Roman church from pagan Rome,

00:28:56.122 --> 00:28:58.330 align:middle line:84%
because they were considered
the heretics of the day,

00:28:58.330 --> 00:28:59.330 align:middle line:90%
as I understand, right?

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yes, of course.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's odd, because all
Christians, all different kinds

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.200 align:middle line:84%
of Christians, not only were
they considered heretics

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.290 align:middle line:84%
by the larger Roman
authorities, they all

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:11.520 align:middle line:90%
called each other heretics.

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:15.960 align:middle line:84%
We have an idea today that the
evil proto-orthodox were just

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.280 align:middle line:90%
condemning the Gnostics.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.800 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics condemned the
proto-orthodox just as much.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And they all did,
and there wasn't even

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:23.820 align:middle line:90%
a thing as Gnosticism.

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.300 align:middle line:90%
There were different groups.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.920 align:middle line:90%
Nobody called himself a Gnostic.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:30.000 align:middle line:84%
They were Valentinians and
Marcionites and Markonites

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.440 align:middle line:84%
and all different kinds
of groups-- Paulicians,

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.390 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And they have different
beliefs about them.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's, again, where these
stereotypes start to form,

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.886 align:middle line:84%
is where you have all
these different groups.

00:29:41.886 --> 00:29:45.750 align:middle line:84%
As I'm writing in
a new book I have,

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:48.840 align:middle line:84%
going to be shopping around,
one of the chapters is called,

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.282 align:middle line:84%
"In the beginning,
everyone was a jerk."

00:29:51.282 --> 00:29:52.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What is this book?

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:55.160 align:middle line:90%
What's the subject and title?

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: It's
essentially-- I'm going

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.330 align:middle line:84%
to give an actual academic
treatment to the holy mushroom

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:01.926 align:middle line:90%
theory, because nobody has yet.

00:30:01.926 --> 00:30:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, no
one has done that yet.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:06.132 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Maybe we'll talk
about that when the book comes

00:30:06.132 --> 00:30:06.285 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:30:06.285 --> 00:30:07.085 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Sure.

00:30:07.085 --> 00:30:12.330 align:middle line:84%
The Christian side of it
just pays no mind to it,

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:13.760 align:middle line:90%
and, oh, it's all nonsense.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And the conspiracy side
is saying that there were

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.170 align:middle line:84%
mushrooms in paintings,
which there aren't.

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm actually going
to do is demonstrate that.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.510 align:middle line:90%
And I do on my website.

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:24.632 align:middle line:84%
I've written several
articles on this.

00:30:24.632 --> 00:30:26.090 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the times,
the people that

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:27.560 align:middle line:84%
say that there are
mushrooms in paintings

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.393 align:middle line:84%
don't actually know
what they're looking at.

00:30:29.393 --> 00:30:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And so they take regular
things, for example, like nails,

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:34.356 align:middle line:90%
and say that they're mushrooms.

00:30:34.356 --> 00:30:36.230 align:middle line:84%
But I don't even want
to talk about all that.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:38.229 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, we don't
talk about it right now.

00:30:38.229 --> 00:30:40.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we're going
back to heretics.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And we're going back to
the fact that everybody

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.990 align:middle line:90%
had their own belief.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:46.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one tribe, one sect
was against the other sect,

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:50.990 align:middle line:84%
and then you had
the powers that be.

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And so looking at it
from that point of view,

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:59.180 align:middle line:84%
no one was really safe,
it would seem to me.

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:02.320 align:middle line:84%
All of these good women,
or these wise women

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.150 align:middle line:84%
were vulnerable in
one way or another,

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:07.440 align:middle line:84%
because someone was
sure to be after them.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Absolutely.

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It wasn't just the
Romans and the Roman church

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:12.150 align:middle line:90%
later on.

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well, the Romans-- I
mean the Christian, let's say,

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:20.860 align:middle line:84%
fear of witchcraft actually
stems from Roman paganism.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:23.465 align:middle line:84%
Women were burned
under pagan Rome.

00:31:23.465 --> 00:31:26.520 align:middle line:84%
I know that that's not
a very popular idea.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:30.880 align:middle line:84%
People seem to think that
witches at the time were fine

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.230 align:middle line:84%
under pagan Rome,
but they weren't.

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:37.040 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in one case-- I don't
remember the exact year of it,

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.550 align:middle line:84%
but this one witch
asked if she could

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:41.407 align:middle line:84%
have the honor of
igniting her competitor.

00:31:41.407 --> 00:31:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, jeez.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:43.915 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:43.915 --> 00:31:45.248 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Competitive business.

00:31:45.248 --> 00:31:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, it really was.

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And what's odd is that when
Christians actually took over,

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:54.960 align:middle line:84%
they were the first ones to
kind of temper these laws.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it remained
for several centuries

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.510 align:middle line:90%
until the witch stereotype.

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Like I said earlier,
the few records

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:05.294 align:middle line:84%
we have that date to
after the fall of Rome

00:32:05.294 --> 00:32:06.960 align:middle line:84%
and, let's say, the
rise of the European

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:11.550 align:middle line:84%
University in the 1200s, 1300s
actually have theologians,

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:14.446 align:middle line:84%
clergymen, saving women
from her neighbors who

00:32:14.446 --> 00:32:15.570 align:middle line:90%
were accused of witchcraft.

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: See, that's an
interesting twist on it.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.113 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, it is,
because, again, there

00:32:19.113 --> 00:32:20.440 align:middle line:90%
wasn't a witch stereotype yet.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's why,
again, I don't believe

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:25.866 align:middle line:84%
that Hildegard of Bingen, if she
were using her potions to have

00:32:25.866 --> 00:32:28.249 align:middle line:84%
her visions, I mean,
people have visions

00:32:28.249 --> 00:32:30.290 align:middle line:84%
all the time without the
use of these substances.

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Then Benandanti would be a
perfect example at the time.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Carl Ginsburg, who's
a great scholar

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.840 align:middle line:84%
has shown that this
was a group that

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:42.030 align:middle line:84%
used no psychoactive
potions, ointments at all,

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:45.950 align:middle line:84%
and yet when the clergyman got
them into the torture rooms,

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:47.555 align:middle line:84%
they were trying
to force onto them,

00:32:47.555 --> 00:32:49.440 align:middle line:84%
oh, you must be using
these ointments.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.440 align:middle line:90%
But they weren't.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.055 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They just had
mastered consciousness.

00:32:52.055 --> 00:32:52.855 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:32:52.855 --> 00:32:57.229 align:middle line:84%
They had been raised their whole
lives to-- it's social program.

00:32:57.229 --> 00:32:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you've been
raised your whole life

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:01.860 align:middle line:84%
to believe that on this
set date at this set hour

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.320 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
fall into a trance,

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.100 align:middle line:90%
it's the power of suggestion.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:07.969 align:middle line:90%
It's very strong.

00:33:07.969 --> 00:33:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And there wasn't
really much of a stereotype

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.910 align:middle line:84%
even of the clergy during a
lot of this period of time.

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:15.300 align:middle line:84%
In your book, you were talking
about how the clergy had

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.290 align:middle line:84%
to have very clear laws
laid out for themselves

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:21.290 align:middle line:84%
on their gambling and
drinking and philandering.

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:22.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were
having a hard time

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:25.685 align:middle line:84%
living up to some of those
basic statutes themselves.

00:33:25.685 --> 00:33:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Absolutely.

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's even
like with the case.

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:29.840 align:middle line:84%
You have to take it
case-by-case basis.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And also with clergy,
you have to take it

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:33.830 align:middle line:90%
on a case-by-case basis.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Certain guys like,
for example, John

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:42.120 align:middle line:84%
of Capistrano, who was
active during the mid-1400s

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and during the creation
of the witch stereotype

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:47.810 align:middle line:90%
thought it was all bunk.

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And he tried to convince people
that, no, there's no witches.

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:53.440 align:middle line:90%
This is not a real thing.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Johan [INAUDIBLE]
was another guy.

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:57.620 align:middle line:84%
But then you have others,
like Juan de Torquemada,

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:01.210 align:middle line:84%
who was infamous for his
misogyny and his wanting

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:04.610 align:middle line:84%
to burn everything and
anything that came in this path

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:08.199 align:middle line:84%
if he didn't agree with
what they were doing.

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:11.829 align:middle line:84%
So it's rough, because
we say the church,

00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:13.120 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't the whole church.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, it's a
really convoluted story.

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Very convoluted story.

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I came away with.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:21.969 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there really aren't
any stereotypes per se

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:24.460 align:middle line:90%
in the sense, the whole brew.

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And you just said,
John, and I was

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:29.290 align:middle line:84%
thinking-- I was reading
about John the Baptist

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:30.840 align:middle line:90%
and Salome in the book.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And why did this
story come into it?

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.040 align:middle line:90%
How did it feature in your book?

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Because
one of the goddesses

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:41.179 align:middle line:84%
that wise women were
accused of falling

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:44.199 align:middle line:84%
was Herodia, who
was the woman who

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:48.100 align:middle line:90%
apparently had John executed.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:51.650 align:middle line:84%
She asked for plate of
John's head on a platter.

00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:54.360 align:middle line:90%
That was Herod Antipas' wife.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And he had asked
her daughter-- she

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:02.490 align:middle line:84%
was dancing that at his birthday
party for all his guests.

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:04.000 align:middle line:90%
And he said, this is so great.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.680 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you anything you want.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And she asked Herodias,
well, what should I tell him?

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:11.246 align:middle line:84%
And she said tell him you
want John the Baptist.

00:35:11.246 --> 00:35:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually
how-- I mean,

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.400 align:middle line:84%
legend has it that's how
John the Baptist was killed.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was just curious
about that, because I thought,

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.074 align:middle line:84%
how did this land in
the middle of the story?

00:35:20.074 --> 00:35:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: And I think
it had to do with-- take

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:23.460 align:middle line:90%
in southern Germany.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:26.380 align:middle line:84%
You had "er" names for that
archetypal great mother,

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:28.075 align:middle line:90%
like Berthe, Perchdia.

00:35:28.075 --> 00:35:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that was
Herodia, like it

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:35.550 align:middle line:84%
was just a-- it was so
linguistically similar.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:38.910 align:middle line:84%
So it was just an easy way,
again, to demonize these women

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:41.990 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, look, they're
worshipping the murderers

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:43.440 align:middle line:90%
of John the Baptist.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a way to make it
seem more extreme and horrible

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.340 align:middle line:90%
than it really was.

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:49.820 align:middle line:84%
But again, these women were
worshiping fertility goddesses.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.590 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about
a metamorphosis.

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:55.830 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that's interesting.

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:57.520 align:middle line:90%
You go into some depth of that.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.620 align:middle line:90%
And let's talk about that.

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:01.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just like
women flying on brooms

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.900 align:middle line:84%
and leaving their body
in an astral travel.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:07.080 align:middle line:84%
There are others that said that
they could transform themselves

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:11.555 align:middle line:84%
into an animal, for example,
just like shaman today claim

00:36:11.555 --> 00:36:12.769 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:36:12.769 --> 00:36:13.810 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:15.393 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Well, it's
weird because you

00:36:15.393 --> 00:36:16.510 align:middle line:90%
get two different ways.

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:18.630 align:middle line:90%
Again, the variety was so much.

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:24.450 align:middle line:84%
You have the shamanistic
part, where people perhaps

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:29.550 align:middle line:84%
were using the ointments
for shamanistic purposes,

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:36.990 align:middle line:84%
for example Peretti in Rome,
who was a pediatrician.

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, there seems
to have been-- she certainly

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:44.770 align:middle line:84%
invoked medical spirits, these
odd forms of medical spirits.

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:50.070 align:middle line:84%
There was this odd form of
Christo-pagan medicinal medical

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:52.920 align:middle line:84%
magic, or medicinal medical,
not to be redundant or anything.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, were they
just drawing beings in from

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:56.390 align:middle line:84%
other realms to assist
and the process?

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:57.180 align:middle line:90%
Is that kind of what it was?

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yes, exactly.

00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:59.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
calling upon them.

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:04.650 align:middle line:84%
She used her ointment to imagine
she was turning into a cat.

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible that that has
some shamanistic underpinnings

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:09.700 align:middle line:84%
to it, just like
Siberian shamans

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.059 align:middle line:84%
and other people and
Peruvian shamanism.

00:37:12.059 --> 00:37:13.600 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that
there is some kind

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.290 align:middle line:90%
of cross-cultural connection.

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:17.460 align:middle line:90%
But we don't exactly know.

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.640 align:middle line:84%
I hypothesize it
was used that way

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.360 align:middle line:90%
because she was a wise woman.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.960 align:middle line:84%
But there's really
no way to know.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.344 align:middle line:84%
Now, as far as another type
of these kinds of animal

00:37:25.344 --> 00:37:26.760 align:middle line:84%
transformations,
it seemed to just

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.360 align:middle line:84%
be a form of entertainment,
like on a boring

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Saturday, like I mentioned
before, the guy who would just

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:35.820 align:middle line:84%
pretend he was a goose or
a duck walking around town.

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:39.220 align:middle line:84%
It was just a form of-- before
the internet, TV, radio,

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.890 align:middle line:90%
it was just something to do.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:44.560 align:middle line:84%
There was another case I
found of these girls who

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:49.204 align:middle line:84%
were using it to turn into
cows to fly to a witch mountain

00:37:49.204 --> 00:37:51.120 align:middle line:84%
so that they could have
like this bacchanalian

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.170 align:middle line:90%
kind of revelry.

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:53.976 align:middle line:84%
And because the
spell went wrong,

00:37:53.976 --> 00:37:55.350 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, on
one of the girls,

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:57.810 align:middle line:84%
she end up going crazy
because of the drug.

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:00.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the hallucinations
were just too strong.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.430 align:middle line:84%
The girl who gave it to her
was burned for poison magic,

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:05.770 align:middle line:90%
or drug magic.

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:08.670 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like they were
just out there doing this.

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:10.170 align:middle line:84%
They were in a
strawberry patch just

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:13.860 align:middle line:84%
trying to entertain themselves
in some form or another.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Like people do
today, really no difference.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, as
I recall, the church

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.340 align:middle line:84%
would come after these
women for these claims,

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:25.397 align:middle line:84%
for claims such as this,
or the church or whomever.

00:38:25.397 --> 00:38:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: It usually
started with a neighbor

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:28.840 align:middle line:90%
taking someone to trial.

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:32.440 align:middle line:84%
It's odd, because how
these larger witch

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:41.240 align:middle line:84%
burnings worked was you'd have--
so my child is sick, right?

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:43.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't have kids, but
hypothetically, my child

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:44.120 align:middle line:90%
is sick.

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:49.740 align:middle line:84%
So I take my sick child
to Meredith the or Regina

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.090 align:middle line:84%
or somebody or whoever
the Medicine Woman.

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And my child ends
up dying anyway.

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And now it's like,
oh, damn, I need

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:59.060 align:middle line:84%
I need some kind of
satisfaction from this.

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.960 align:middle line:84%
So now you're brought
into trial, right?

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Or you're brought into
the secular courts.

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And now we understand, of
course-- again, we "know"--

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:09.940 align:middle line:90%
that there's not just one witch.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.970 align:middle line:90%
There's a society witches.

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:15.096 align:middle line:84%
So then you're tortured
into confessing,

00:39:15.096 --> 00:39:17.900 align:middle line:84%
well, Suzanne outside
or something was also

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:18.700 align:middle line:90%
part of this.

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:19.790 align:middle line:90%
So then she's brought in.

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:21.180 align:middle line:90%
Now, she's not a witch at all.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.555 align:middle line:84%
She's just somebody
that was name

00:39:22.555 --> 00:39:25.010 align:middle line:84%
dropped because, when those
thumbscrews are going in,

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:26.218 align:middle line:90%
you're going to say anything.

00:39:26.218 --> 00:39:28.130 align:middle line:84%
It's like we know today
torture doesn't work.

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:31.990 align:middle line:84%
So you have now Suzanne
is going to say,

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:34.920 align:middle line:84%
oh, this other person,
Ellie or whatever, now she's

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.500 align:middle line:90%
accused of witchcraft.

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:39.807 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you
have this large-- all

00:39:39.807 --> 00:39:41.640 align:middle line:84%
these different people
are now being brought

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.790 align:middle line:84%
in and under Inquisitorial
procedure and promises

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:46.886 align:middle line:90%
of freedom if they confess.

00:39:46.886 --> 00:39:48.260 align:middle line:84%
They're all saying,
yeah, OK, I'm

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.650 align:middle line:90%
a part of this large conspiracy.

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And before they know it,
they end up at the stake.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.290 align:middle line:84%
But usually, most
of the cases started

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:58.290 align:middle line:84%
with one woman being
brought to trial,

00:39:58.290 --> 00:39:59.790 align:middle line:90%
just like Matteuccia was.

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:02.410 align:middle line:84%
She was brought initially
because her neighbors wanted

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:03.210 align:middle line:90%
to.

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:06.030 align:middle line:84%
But it was also weird with
her, because it's a mix.

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Because she was only brought
to trial to the secular courts

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:11.020 align:middle line:84%
because this guy
Bernardino of Sienna

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:13.145 align:middle line:84%
had convinced her neighbors
that what she was doing

00:40:13.145 --> 00:40:14.380 align:middle line:90%
was witchcraft.

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:15.180 align:middle line:90%
So it's odd.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.055 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is odd.

00:40:16.055 --> 00:40:16.930 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:18.340 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I get what you're saying.

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, it's everybody
not realizing it but acting

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.550 align:middle line:90%
in unison to create this.

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases-- there
was a village in Germany.

00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:28.380 align:middle line:84%
By the time they were done,
there was nobody left.

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.770 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was
burned at the stake.

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:32.175 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Jeez.

00:40:32.175 --> 00:40:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's speak about the Rhineland
since you talked about Germany.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:39.690 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to bring that up,
ergot, the fungus on the rye.

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yes.

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:41.864 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's
talk about that.

00:40:41.864 --> 00:40:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, ergot was
used for different reasons,

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:48.170 align:middle line:84%
mostly to help stimulate
contractions and birth control.

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually a
perfect example of something.

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:56.560 align:middle line:84%
So a woman giving birth is
given ergot to stimulate

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.310 align:middle line:90%
the contractions to help along.

00:40:58.310 --> 00:40:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Now she starts
having what we would

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:02.120 align:middle line:90%
call a psychedelic experience.

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.360 align:middle line:90%
Now she's in a lot of pain.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.210 align:middle line:90%
She's giving birth.

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:06.190 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
affect her mindset.

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And now all of a
sudden, she's going

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:10.100 align:middle line:84%
to think that there was
a spell cast on her.

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Because of the state of
medicine at the time,

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:16.210 align:middle line:84%
most children died
during childbirth.

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:19.950 align:middle line:84%
So now you have a woman
who, unfortunately, doesn't

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:23.110 align:middle line:84%
know any better,
but in her mind,

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:27.140 align:middle line:84%
well, I went to this wise
woman, she cast a spell on me,

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.690 align:middle line:84%
I had all these visions of
demons flying through the air,

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:31.820 align:middle line:90%
and my child died.

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And now that woman is now
accused of witchcraft.

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:36.900 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't trying to
help deliver a child.

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:39.670 align:middle line:84%
She wanted to kill
the child and perhaps

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:41.634 align:middle line:90%
the mother, too, or something.

00:41:41.634 --> 00:41:43.550 align:middle line:84%
It's all really sad when
you read the records.

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:44.950 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And then you
had this inadvertent stuff,

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:47.480 align:middle line:10%
like what was it called,
the Rhineland hysteria?

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:50.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Oh, yeah.

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes during a rainy season
and you get ergot onto crops.

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And people might not
have realized it.

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Attached to the rye,
a fungus that attached to rye

00:41:58.820 --> 00:41:59.300 align:middle line:90%
grain.

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.383 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, exactly,
a fungus attached to rye.

00:42:01.383 --> 00:42:04.790 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the base
element of LSD, is ergot.

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:07.446 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure many of your
viewers know that, though.

00:42:07.446 --> 00:42:10.040 align:middle line:90%


00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The whole town would
be off their rocker at one

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.940 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:15.523 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, and I mean, you
have people literally drowning

00:42:15.523 --> 00:42:18.280 align:middle line:84%
themselves just to
escape the torments.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Because I mean, St.
Anthony's Fire, Ignis Sacer,

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:25.240 align:middle line:84%
or the Holy Fire, I mean, it
caused bubbles on your skin.

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:29.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, once one person
got infected, I mean,

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:33.540 align:middle line:84%
chances are that whole town--
you could run as fast as you

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:34.470 align:middle line:90%
want, but--

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:37.409 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: These are just
interesting glimpses of how

00:42:37.409 --> 00:42:39.450 align:middle line:84%
these things happen in
history, which, of course,

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:40.710 align:middle line:90%
today would never occur.

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Of course, because
there had to be-- well,

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.160 align:middle line:90%
how did this all happen?

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.430 align:middle line:90%
We have a loving God, right?

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Well, there must be Satan.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.790 align:middle line:90%
But how could Satan be here?

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, there must be
witches conjuring Satan.

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was just like
this was the illogic.

00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:42:57.410 --> 00:43:01.619 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about some
of the drugs themselves

00:43:01.619 --> 00:43:03.660 align:middle line:84%
that were used, some of
the herbs that were used.

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:05.750 align:middle line:84%
Because a really popular
one in the day-- and we

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:08.030 align:middle line:84%
can just talk about some
of the really practical

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:09.970 align:middle line:90%
uses of it-- with opium.

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:11.240 align:middle line:90%
Opium was big by itself.

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean, even in child care.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:13.940 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Absolutely.

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:18.700 align:middle line:84%
So one of the major problems
in the Inquisitorial records

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:21.775 align:middle line:84%
is that they didn't
care what drug was used.

00:43:21.775 --> 00:43:25.180 align:middle line:84%
It was a secondary concern to
the fact that a drug was used.

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:26.870 align:middle line:84%
So most of the time
you get that word

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:30.610 align:middle line:84%
"vene," which just means
poison, or certes herbes,

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:34.160 align:middle line:84%
which just means a certain kind
of herb, or pocula amatori,

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and who knows what was in
that, the love filter, who

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:38.930 align:middle line:90%
knows what was in that.

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's only when you have
the physicians-- because most

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:45.760 align:middle line:84%
of the time when a person
was brought into trial

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:49.710 align:middle line:84%
or to be inquested, there was
a physician there also taking

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:50.540 align:middle line:90%
notes.

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And you have an inquisitor
saying, oh, it's the devil,

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:55.840 align:middle line:90%
it's the devil.

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:58.476 align:middle line:84%
And you have the
physician saying, nah,

00:43:58.476 --> 00:43:59.780 align:middle line:90%
she's probably on opium.

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:00.770 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Like that's probably
what that is.

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And opium is a weird one,
because it didn't grow wildly

00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:09.020 align:middle line:90%
in these regions.

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:11.040 align:middle line:84%
So people had access
to opium if they

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:14.520 align:middle line:84%
were near a town that had an
apothecary that got opium.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.730 align:middle line:84%
But most of the
plants that were used

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:19.430 align:middle line:84%
were things that were easy
to come by, like henbane.

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Talk about
henbane for a moment.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Henbane is--
we actually today,

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:27.670 align:middle line:84%
just like Coca-Cola used
to have cocaine in it.

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:29.290 align:middle line:84%
That's where
Coca-Cola comes from.

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:32.550 align:middle line:84%
We actually have the
historical residue

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:35.970 align:middle line:84%
of when henbane was put to
make beer strong in the name

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:39.850 align:middle line:84%
"pilsner." "Bilsen"
is German for henbane.

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So a bilsenkraut is a beer
that had henbane in it.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000 align:middle line:10%
But once the henbane
was taken out,

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.140 align:middle line:10%
there were laws against it.

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:48.770 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: What was the
effect of the henbane?

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:50.020 align:middle line:10%
>>HATSIS: Ooh, henbane is odd.

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:52.080 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: In your beer.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.440 align:middle line:10%
They called it a
crazy-making plant.

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:57.220 align:middle line:84%
But it will cause
hallucinations.

00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:00.990 align:middle line:84%
It will cause-- I've
actually inhaled henbane.

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:04.120 align:middle line:90%
Kids, don't inhale henbane.

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.990 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty interesting.

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:middle line:90%
Henbane is very powerful.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.344 align:middle line:84%
It causes, at least
for me it was--

00:45:12.344 --> 00:45:13.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
get into all that,

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:16.440 align:middle line:90%
but I wouldn't recommend it.

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.700 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: OK, so no on--
cross off on the henbane,

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.080 align:middle line:10%
and don't make your home
brew with it, either.

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Oh, no, you can,
just don't use too much.

00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:28.502 align:middle line:84%
It's just like anything,
dose, set, and setting.

00:45:28.502 --> 00:45:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Don't take too much,
have a good mindset,

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:31.390 align:middle line:90%
and be in a good place.

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What about mandrake?

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Mandrake.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:37.120 align:middle line:10%
Mandrake was probably
the most popular plant

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:41.260 align:middle line:10%
found in love
filters, because it's

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:46.960 align:middle line:10%
also highly psychoactive
and easy to come by.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.370 align:middle line:10%
Because mandrake
actually will continue

00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:50.780 align:middle line:10%
to grow in the same area.

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:55.700 align:middle line:10%
That's one of the linguistic
ideas of where the name comes

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:59.140 align:middle line:10%
from, is mandra agora, which
means "usual meeting place."

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:04.360 align:middle line:10%
And mandrake was a
big addition into--

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.640 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: It had
ecstasy-like effects?

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.980 align:middle line:10%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, it can.

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:10.202 align:middle line:10%
It can, usually if
mixed with opium.

00:46:10.202 --> 00:46:12.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I was going
to get to this mix in a little

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:14.620 align:middle line:84%
but that was used
on these sponges.

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Oh, yeah, the
soporific sponges, yeah.

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:17.918 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, I found
it really interesting.

00:46:17.918 --> 00:46:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: That's actually
how we-- the first references

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:25.220 align:middle line:84%
we have to the use of
ointments by shamans

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:29.530 align:middle line:84%
comes from people talking
about the medical use of them.

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And one of the more
important things about that

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:35.070 align:middle line:84%
is that they weren't
trying to prove at the time

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:38.250 align:middle line:84%
that people used these
ointments for this purpose,

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:41.870 align:middle line:84%
again, because it's before
the witch stereotype.

00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:44.210 align:middle line:84%
One guy I write about
named Alonso Tostado, who

00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:46.970 align:middle line:90%
was the bishop of Avila, Spain.

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:52.100 align:middle line:84%
He wrote commentaries, biblical
literalist commentaries.

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Biblical literalism
is just the idea

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:56.630 align:middle line:84%
that the stories in the Bible
were true not based on face

00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:57.984 align:middle line:90%
but based on reason.

00:46:57.984 --> 00:46:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I think I just
said based on face.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:00.070 align:middle line:90%
I meant faith.

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:01.236 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Faith, we got it.

00:47:01.236 --> 00:47:02.710 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Based on faith.

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:04.880 align:middle line:90%
But they were based on reason.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:08.370 align:middle line:84%
So this guy's
writing a commentary

00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:10.920 align:middle line:84%
on the book of Genesis,
and he's trying to decide,

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.290 align:middle line:84%
how could God, or I guess
in this sense Yahweh,

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:16.490 align:middle line:84%
take a rib from Adam to
create Eve without causing him

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:17.450 align:middle line:90%
any pain?

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:21.080 align:middle line:84%
So his literalist reason,
his rationale for this,

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:24.390 align:middle line:84%
is, oh, God must have used
one of those medical ointments

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:26.700 align:middle line:84%
on Adam to cast him
into a deep sleep.

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And he could pull the rib,
and Adam would be fine.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.884 align:middle line:84%
And then he has this
off-the-cuff comment

00:47:30.884 --> 00:47:32.550 align:middle line:84%
just saying, and by
the way, we actually

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:37.280 align:middle line:84%
know that certain women actually
know about these ointments,

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.000 align:middle line:84%
and they tend to fly away
and imagine that they're

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:40.400 align:middle line:90%
having these experiences.

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.983 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it
gets linked together.

00:47:41.983 --> 00:47:43.450 align:middle line:84%
But it was
interesting, because we

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:46.730 align:middle line:84%
think of surgery in ancient
times and think, oh, my God,

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:48.030 align:middle line:90%
how did they manage it?

00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:49.320 align:middle line:90%
They did manage it.

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:51.990 align:middle line:84%
They put these together
and had the sponges,

00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:53.010 align:middle line:90%
as I recall you said.

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:55.467 align:middle line:84%
They were stuffed up their
nose to put them into--

00:47:55.467 --> 00:47:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: To a deep sleep.

00:47:56.550 --> 00:47:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --a deep, deep sleep
so that they could have surgery

00:47:58.760 --> 00:47:59.820 align:middle line:90%
performed on them.

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:02.130 align:middle line:84%
But one other another
thing I found interesting

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:07.060 align:middle line:84%
was how they were used for a
kind of merciful execution.

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Your wrote about that
in the book at one point

00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:13.310 align:middle line:84%
that someone being executed
was actually administered

00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:15.880 align:middle line:90%
some of these calmatives.

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: At times
they would be.

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's that
case-by-case basis.

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, but
you would never--

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:23.860 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't put those two
together in ancient times,

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:26.620 align:middle line:84%
that there would be a merciful
process to one's execution.

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:27.786 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Well, it depended.

00:48:27.786 --> 00:48:31.820 align:middle line:84%
If you were a rich individual,
then there might be.

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:33.766 align:middle line:84%
One of the more
interesting things

00:48:33.766 --> 00:48:36.140 align:middle line:84%
I found out that I was not
aware of at all in my research

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:38.360 align:middle line:84%
is that up until
about the 1300s,

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:42.950 align:middle line:84%
the majority of people burned
for sorcery were men, rich men,

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:45.160 align:middle line:84%
and it was a way to just
get them out of the picture.

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Really?

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Yeah.

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And they might be
administered these things.

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:53.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, even a
pope, Pope Boniface,

00:48:53.850 --> 00:48:58.280 align:middle line:84%
was accused of witchcraft, found
innocent, then after he died,

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:01.560 align:middle line:84%
it was then decided that
he was actually guilty.

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.070 align:middle line:84%
They disinterred the
remains and burned them.

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:05.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:10.140 align:middle line:90%
So they could be administered.

00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:14.540 align:middle line:84%
There was also a manual
in the 1600s, [INAUDIBLE],

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:17.460 align:middle line:84%
where a guy said
that in some cases,

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:20.800 align:middle line:84%
a torturer would actually
just drug the person

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:26.144 align:middle line:84%
being inquested just to make
her say outlandish things.

00:49:26.144 --> 00:49:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like,
I'm going to give you

00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:30.199 align:middle line:84%
this drug that perhaps
you've never taken before,

00:49:30.199 --> 00:49:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to have
this psychic effect,

00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:34.063 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
start really feeling it.

00:49:34.063 --> 00:49:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm going to bring all
the theologians, say, look,

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:36.770 align:middle line:90%
she's crazy.

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:39.570 align:middle line:90%
See, look at how nuts she is.

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:41.860 align:middle line:84%
They were used in so
many different ways,

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:43.176 align:middle line:90%
these substances.

00:49:43.176 --> 00:49:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, we're coming
toward the end of our time,

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:49.340 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to go without
getting to the-- Waldensian?

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: Mhm.

00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:52.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Waldensian
barbes and sorceresses.

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Because it seemed they
held a unique spot.

00:49:55.590 --> 00:49:56.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: They did.

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:59.220 align:middle line:84%
The barbes were mostly
traveling physicians.

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And they went out to remote
places and the backwoods areas

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:07.790 align:middle line:84%
of Europe to preach their
gospel, the Waldensian gospel.

00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:12.619 align:middle line:84%
And that was not OK, because
they were considered heretics.

00:50:12.619 --> 00:50:14.160 align:middle line:84%
At first when they
were first formed,

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.810 align:middle line:84%
they were actually praised by
the church for their piety.

00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And then later on when they
grew too powerful and they had

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:22.780 align:middle line:84%
attracted such a following, it's
like, oh, well, they gotta--

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:24.200 align:middle line:90%
we gotta to get rid of them.

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:28.860 align:middle line:10%
And some of the
backwoods areas--

00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:32.710 align:middle line:10%
I had mentioned earlier
Billia la Castagna, who

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:35.830 align:middle line:10%
seems to have been a
Waldensian and also

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:40.280 align:middle line:10%
a wise woman in the
same sense of like today

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:43.120 align:middle line:10%
your brother isn't
just your brother.

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:45.110 align:middle line:84%
He might also be the
husband of somebody.

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:49.610 align:middle line:84%
He might also be an artist, and
in his day job he's a mechanic.

00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:53.294 align:middle line:84%
Different people-- if there
was one thing that I was trying

00:50:53.294 --> 00:50:55.210 align:middle line:84%
to get across in my book
by the stories I tell

00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:58.520 align:middle line:84%
is that these are not
flat, individual people.

00:50:58.520 --> 00:50:59.840 align:middle line:90%
They're not flat.

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.050 align:middle line:90%
They had hopes, desires, dreams.

00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:03.590 align:middle line:90%
They were multi-leveled.

00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Complex.

00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Yeah, they were
just like we are today.

00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:middle line:84%
So to call someone-- it all
depends on the perspective.

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Like Billia, to her
people, she was a healer.

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:16.810 align:middle line:84%
To the clergy,
she was a heretic.

00:51:16.810 --> 00:51:20.080 align:middle line:84%
To somebody else that maybe
her spell didn't work on,

00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.550 align:middle line:90%
she was a sorceress.

00:51:21.550 --> 00:51:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, yeah,
she was all those things.

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And why were they
particularly either feared

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:28.567 align:middle line:84%
or respected, this
particular group?

00:51:28.567 --> 00:51:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HATSIS: The Waldensians?

00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:30.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mhm.

00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>>HATSIS: Because of how
really prevalent they were.

00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:38.970 align:middle line:84%
The Cathars had been stamped
out in the Albigensian Crusade

00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:40.210 align:middle line:90%
in the 1200s.

00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:41.960 align:middle line:84%
But the Waldensians
had survived.

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So much of this has to do
with that kind of competition

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:48.680 align:middle line:84%
to the church, the
wise women that were

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:52.050 align:middle line:90%
giving different medical cures.

00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:53.780 align:middle line:84%
They were a competition
to the church,

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:54.946 align:middle line:90%
so we gotta get rid of them.

00:51:54.946 --> 00:51:57.757 align:middle line:84%
The Waldensians, they were a
competition to the spirituality

00:51:57.757 --> 00:51:59.840 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the-- so we've
got to get rid of them.

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:03.160 align:middle line:84%
The Waldensians
were very powerful.

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.080 align:middle line:84%
They attracted a
large following.

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:07.070 align:middle line:90%
And so did these wise women.

00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they were each
in their own regard stamped out.

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.900 align:middle line:84%
But then again, you
have certain wise women

00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:15.650 align:middle line:84%
who would be
Waldensians, and that's

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:18.760 align:middle line:84%
how you see the stereotype
being brought over.

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:24.630 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in an anonymous
tract titled [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Gazari is an old slang
word for witches,

00:52:27.570 --> 00:52:29.230 align:middle line:90%
but it actually means Cathars.

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:32.260 align:middle line:84%
So what we're seeing is that
is that witches are being

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:34.940 align:middle line:90%
called heretics at this time.

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And just from a
linguistic standpoint,

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.700 align:middle line:84%
you could actually watch
that transition happen

00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.710 align:middle line:90%
from the heretic to the witch.

00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:45.446 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, this to me
was a fascinating journey.

00:52:45.446 --> 00:52:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And how does this book
compare to other books

00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:50.170 align:middle line:90%
on entheogens in your mind?

00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:53.670 align:middle line:10%
>>HATSIS: I think it
just fills in that gap.

00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:56.910 align:middle line:10%
Recently there were a lot
of different documentaries

00:52:56.910 --> 00:53:01.060 align:middle line:10%
out that span historical drug
use on the History Channel.

00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:04.470 align:middle line:84%
One just came out that
featured that guy-- what's

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:08.780 align:middle line:84%
that show called in New Mexico
with the-- "Breaking Bad."

00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:09.697 align:middle line:90%
It's some guy on that.

00:53:09.697 --> 00:53:11.238 align:middle line:84%
He did this whole
thing, and he talks

00:53:11.238 --> 00:53:13.649 align:middle line:84%
about the Eleusinian Rites
and everything and everybody.

00:53:13.649 --> 00:53:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about ancient
Greece, ancient Rome,

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:18.580 align:middle line:84%
and then they skip over the
witches and the alchemists,

00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and they go right to people
in Victorian times using opium

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:24.340 align:middle line:90%
and then the modern drug war.

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, no, there's
this whole section there.

00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it just
fills in a gap

00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:35.500 align:middle line:84%
and shows that yeah, there
is a tradition in the West,

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:36.820 align:middle line:90%
and it did survive.

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:38.125 align:middle line:90%
They just called it witchcraft.

00:53:38.125 --> 00:53:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we don't
really know about it today.

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:41.130 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't witchcraft.

00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:45.472 align:middle line:84%
It was an entheogenic practice
to worship the great mother.

>> REGINA: I really appreciate
the fact you took nine years

00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:50.090 align:middle line:84%
and learned functional
Latin, anyway,

00:53:50.090 --> 00:53:52.600 align:middle line:84%
to be able to bring these
fragments to us for this

00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:53.600 align:middle line:90%
missing part of history.

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:54.590 align:middle line:90%
Brilliant work.

00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:55.590 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, John.

>>HATSIS: Thank you
so much for having me.

>> REGINA: What a delightful
retelling of the story

00:53:59.334 --> 00:54:01.980 align:middle line:10%
and setting straight the record
on powerful women healers

00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:02.780 align:middle line:10%
of the past.

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Again, the title of the
book, well researched,

00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:06.990 align:middle line:84%
is called "The Witches'
Ointment," which you

00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:08.470 align:middle line:90%
can find at major booksellers.

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:11.900 align:middle line:90%
