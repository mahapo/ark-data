>>REGINA MEREDITH: Some of
the top players in the markets

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.398 align:middle line:10%
are now saying they have no
idea where someone should

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:33.880 align:middle line:10%
put their money and assets.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.940 align:middle line:84%
That means big changes are
in the wind for all of us.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.100 align:middle line:84%
We can choose to close
our eyes and be swept away

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.990 align:middle line:84%
with the winds of change
or we can open them

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.820 align:middle line:90%
and choose a different outcome.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:84%

operative word.

Catherine Austin
Fitts is with us

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.750 align:middle line:84%
here again to share her
wisdom on how we can take back

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.830 align:middle line:84%
our lives from the craziness
that is surrounding this

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.480 align:middle line:90%
in the entire economic field.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody's just
sitting there glazed over,

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.690 align:middle line:84%
just wanting to pass the
donuts and beer nuts, you know?

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.770 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand what's
going on, except it ain't good.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Our audience knows
you well by now.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have been a deep
insider in the world of money,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.230 align:middle line:84%
and where it moves, how
it moves, and so forth.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And you have also just
incredibly lucid thinking

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.390 align:middle line:84%
on how we can take ourselves
back from the hole that's

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.260 align:middle line:90%
been created for us.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.580 align:middle line:90%
And start with crazy.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.024 align:middle line:90%
I just said crazy.

00:01:26.024 --> 00:01:28.690 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about-- I saw this
on one of the shows you've done

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.180 align:middle line:90%
recently-- $9 trillion dollars.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.184 align:middle line:90%
$9 trillion.

00:01:32.184 --> 00:01:33.850 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking
millions and billions.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Now we're in the trillions.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.340 align:middle line:84%
It seems to have
gone missing again.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.280 align:middle line:84%
I remember when $2 billion
going missing about 10 years ago

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.120 align:middle line:90%
was a big deal.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CATHERINE AUSTIN FITTS:
That was $2 trillion.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: $2 trillion.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.300 align:middle line:10%
>>FITTS: $2 trillion going--

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.832 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right, $2
trillion going missing.

00:01:44.832 --> 00:01:45.600 align:middle line:10%
>>FITTS: See, it's so big--

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.270 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.950 align:middle line:10%
Exactly.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.825 align:middle line:10%
>>FITTS: You stretch.

00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:48.640 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.130 align:middle line:10%
>>FITTS: The Department of
Defense Inspector General just

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.120 align:middle line:10%
announced in August that
for the fiscal 2015, which

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.920 align:middle line:10%
ended in September
30, 2015, that $6.5

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.250 align:middle line:10%
trillion undocumentable
adjustments occurred

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.050 align:middle line:10%
at year end.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And during the year, $2.8,
for a grand total of $9.3.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Our biggest number until
then had been $2.3 trillion

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.040 align:middle line:84%
in one year, which is many
multiples of the budget.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.690 align:middle line:84%
So this is many, many
multiples of not only the DOD's

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.520 align:middle line:84%
entire budget, but the
entire federal budget.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, under
the Constitution,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.880 align:middle line:84%
you're not supposed to
spend money that hasn't been

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.320 align:middle line:90%
envisioned in an appropriation.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Needless to say,
$9.3 trillion, which

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.750 align:middle line:84%
is many multiples of the federal
budget, was not authorized.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It sounds legal.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.650 align:middle line:84%
It just says what,
undocumented adjustables?

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.970 align:middle line:90%
What the heck does that mean?

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Why does everything
sound like it's legal?

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: In grossly
over-simplified terms,

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.140 align:middle line:84%
what it means is, if you
got your bank statement

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.290 align:middle line:84%
and it said that you had $9,300
less than you thought you had,

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.260 align:middle line:84%
and you wrote a balancing
entry on your checkbook saying

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.520 align:middle line:84%
undocumentable
adjustments, $9,300.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my checking
account is balanced.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.430 align:middle line:90%
That's how you do it.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.862 align:middle line:84%
And people say to me, how
can you possibly lose more

00:03:05.862 --> 00:03:06.820 align:middle line:90%
than your whole budget?

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, with securities
fraud, you can, in fact,

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.820 align:middle line:90%
lose $9.3 trillion.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.470 align:middle line:84%
But what it means is if you
look at the outstanding debt

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.140 align:middle line:84%
that we are liable
for, the question

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.820 align:middle line:84%
is, does Treasury have the
real number on its books?

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And we talked just a moment
off-camera about this.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.810 align:middle line:84%
People, certainly
in our audience,

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.080 align:middle line:84%
would think, oh, well,
how does that factor

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.610 align:middle line:84%
in with the notion
of WACC budgets

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.650 align:middle line:84%
where money-- just
massive amounts of money

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.880 align:middle line:84%
disappear into exotic
technologies and some of this.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.229 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: This started--

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Regina, there was a group
of us in the first Bush

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.920 align:middle line:84%
administration who
got laws passed

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.930 align:middle line:90%
requiring financial statements.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And what happened in
1995 was we started

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.950 align:middle line:84%
to get published efforts to
do financial statements that

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.710 align:middle line:84%
would explain why they couldn't
produce financial statements.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:57.610 align:middle line:90%
So imagine this.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.830 align:middle line:84%
The federal government
has never once complied

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.230 align:middle line:90%
with that law since 19--

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.040 align:middle line:90%
basically, 20 years.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.890 align:middle line:84%
So imagine if you just said,
I'm not giving you a 1040

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:07.690 align:middle line:90%
this year.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.930 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
government said to you,

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.840 align:middle line:84%
they're not giving you
financial statements.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.830 align:middle line:84%
But if you go back and
start in fiscal 1998,

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.420 align:middle line:84%
a process began
where money started

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.190 align:middle line:90%
to go missing in huge amounts.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.769 align:middle line:84%
And I call it the
financial coup d'etat.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
$64,000 question

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.180 align:middle line:90%
is, where is the money?

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.280 align:middle line:90%
And how do we get it back?

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is I
believe a lot of this money

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.670 align:middle line:84%
has gone down what's
called the "Black Budget."

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.660 align:middle line:90%
Let me step back.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.540 align:middle line:84%
In 1947 and '49, we passed the
National Security Act, the CIA

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.340 align:middle line:90%
Act.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And we created a
provision for money

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.180 align:middle line:84%
to be clawed out of
government budgets

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.570 align:middle line:90%
to be used for secret projects.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And that became known
as the Black Budget.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And many of us believe it was
levered with organized crime

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.042 align:middle line:84%
flows, with hidden
system of finance.

00:04:54.042 --> 00:04:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Funded by
illegal drug trading,

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.852 align:middle line:84%
even on behalf of
governments, by governments.

00:04:57.852 --> 00:04:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: And levered
with massive amounts

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.360 align:middle line:90%
of financial fraud.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.410 align:middle line:84%
I've written a lot
about mortgage fraud.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.132 align:middle line:84%
But the Black Budget
is certainly one use.

00:05:05.132 --> 00:05:06.840 align:middle line:84%
The question is, what
are the other uses?

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're
looking at it, we now

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.460 align:middle line:84%
have approximately
$50 trillion missing

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.084 align:middle line:84%
between the financial coup
d'etat and the bailouts.

00:05:15.084 --> 00:05:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
that amount of money,

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.850 align:middle line:84%
it's certainly more
than the amount of debt

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.320 align:middle line:90%
we have on the books.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's also enough to
run a world government

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.920 align:middle line:90%
on an endowment basis.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So I think some has
gone to the Black Budget.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.470 align:middle line:84%
But I think also enough
has gone into endowments

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.960 align:middle line:84%
that the establishment now
feels they can cut and run

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.460 align:middle line:84%
because their
dividends and interest

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.430 align:middle line:84%
are enough, even at
these low interest rates,

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.847 align:middle line:84%
to cover their
ongoing operations.

00:05:40.847 --> 00:05:43.013 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it does add
up if you have trillions

00:05:43.013 --> 00:05:44.320 align:middle line:90%
of dollars-- or billions.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.100 align:middle line:90%
Even a tiny percentage.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Because we're imagining,
how many exotic technologies

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.450 align:middle line:84%
can we possibly have to even
warrant trillions of dollars?

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:59.440 align:middle line:90%
But you're saying, no.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.380 align:middle line:84%
It's more like it's
going to, as you call it,

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.147 align:middle line:90%
the top 1% of the 1%?

00:06:04.147 --> 00:06:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, here's the
important thing to understand.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.810 align:middle line:84%
If you're just going
to look at value,

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.830 align:middle line:84%
it's not just the
$40 now $50 trillion

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.470 align:middle line:84%
that's gone missing during
the financial coup d'etat.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.300 align:middle line:84%
The most valuable
technology in the world

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.750 align:middle line:84%
has been spun out into
private ownership and hands.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And my guess is if you're
looking at equity valuations,

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.130 align:middle line:84%
that technology is
worth even more.

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.284 align:middle line:84%
So we've had different
people in charge

00:06:31.284 --> 00:06:32.950 align:middle line:84%
of different aspects
of the Black Budget

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.750 align:middle line:84%
hint at the kind of
technology that has been--

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.104 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you
explain that to us?

00:06:38.104 --> 00:06:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, I'm
thinking of Ben Rich,

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:84%
who used to run the skunkworks
for one of the big defense

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.370 align:middle line:90%
contractors, who in 1990--

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.670 align:middle line:84%
in the mid-90s said, we
now have enough technology

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:49.870 align:middle line:90%
to send ET home.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.020 align:middle line:90%


00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.480 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
secret space program for one?

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.315 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which would require--
that is very exotic technology,

00:06:58.315 --> 00:07:00.070 align:middle line:84%
would require a massive
amount of money.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.590 align:middle line:84%
But you're now talking about
things like free energy.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:03.554 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Free energy.

00:07:03.554 --> 00:07:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Or, a breakthrough.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.220 align:middle line:84%
I should call it
breakthrough energy

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.990 align:middle line:84%
because nothing in
this world is free.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:12.290 align:middle line:84%
But you're talking about
extraordinary technology.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Also, I mean, I
know the faces and names

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.710 align:middle line:84%
of all the people that are
"credited" with outing this.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.170 align:middle line:84%
The various groups
that are credited.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.630 align:middle line:84%
There isn't that kind
of money behind them.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.360 align:middle line:84%
Are you saying there
is another generation

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.620 align:middle line:84%
of this already replicated
technology that is being funded

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:30.782 align:middle line:90%
through the Black Budget?

00:07:30.782 --> 00:07:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Well, we don't know.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
it's not visible.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: It's not visible.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:41.380 align:middle line:84%
But if you study the
reliable witnesses who

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:84%
have talked about what
we're building underground,

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.170 align:middle line:84%
or under the ocean, or what
we're doing in the skies.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.690 align:middle line:90%
If you just start to price out--

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.120 align:middle line:84%
I kept telling everybody
during the bailouts, look,

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.190 align:middle line:84%
this is enough money to pay off
all the residential mortgages

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.250 align:middle line:90%
in the country three times over.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:01.720 align:middle line:84%
So we are not talking
about Wall Street partners

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.180 align:middle line:84%
having offshore accounts and
driving around in Ferraris.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:08.170 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about creating
civilizations on other planets.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.090 align:middle line:84%
So that's where a lot
of it's skimmed off.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And again, those
civilizations really

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.340 align:middle line:84%
would be more or less
reserved for those

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.204 align:middle line:84%
who might need it, like the 1%
of the 1% and their associates.

00:08:18.204 --> 00:08:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Right And
there's another thing

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:20.770 align:middle line:90%
we should bring up.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And that is when the financial
coup d'etat started--

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.720 align:middle line:84%
let me step back
and tell a story.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.670 align:middle line:84%
I was meeting with a
group of pension fund,

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.760 align:middle line:84%
the leading pension
fund adviser or leaders

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.600 align:middle line:84%
in the country in
April of 2000--

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry, of 1997.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And we had a company that
was trying to figure out

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.640 align:middle line:84%
how to re-engineer the federal
budget so the economy could

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.830 align:middle line:84%
really be successful
and the middle class

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.170 align:middle line:84%
could be successful
in globalization.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:84%
We had a wonderful
man on the board

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.600 align:middle line:84%
who was president of the largest
pension fund in the country.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And we showed him
how this could work

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.690 align:middle line:84%
by re-engineering the federal
budget on a place-based basis.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So financing communities
really in a very different way.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me and he
said, you don't understand.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:06.330 align:middle line:90%
It's too late.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.954 align:middle line:84%
I said, what do you
mean it's too late?

00:09:07.954 --> 00:09:09.735 align:middle line:84%
He said, they've given
up on the country.

00:09:09.735 --> 00:09:11.610 align:middle line:84%
They're moving all the
money out in the fall.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.390 align:middle line:90%
They're moving it to Asia.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And a process-- that's when
the financial coup started.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.270 align:middle line:84%
It was the beginning
of fiscal 1998.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And what we saw on globalization
was tremendous amounts

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.240 align:middle line:84%
of money pulled out of
this economy in North

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.060 align:middle line:84%
America and the developed world
and moved into the emerging

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.824 align:middle line:90%
markets.

00:09:29.824 --> 00:09:31.240 align:middle line:84%
So in addition to
the Black Budget

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:36.880 align:middle line:84%
and in addition to creating
an endowment for whatever--

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.370 align:middle line:84%
or really, call that
privatization of government

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.390 align:middle line:90%
at the root.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, there was
significant investment

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:46.040 align:middle line:84%
to be made in terms
of globalization.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And that has been a piece
of it, one way or the other.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if America
officially stopped being

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.570 align:middle line:84%
invested in-- what,
you say, 1998--

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.540 align:middle line:84%
they'd abandon the
notion of putting money

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.640 align:middle line:84%
back into our real
infrastructure and development

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.320 align:middle line:90%
as communities in such.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.306 align:middle line:84%
Then, this isn't really
just a "good idea"

00:10:04.306 --> 00:10:06.430 align:middle line:84%
that we're looking at when
we go into the solutions

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:07.670 align:middle line:90%
part of this conversation.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.570 align:middle line:90%
This is absolute necessity?

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, we didn't
just stop all infrastructure

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:14.230 align:middle line:90%
investment.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.120 align:middle line:84%
So you've seen a
lot of investment

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.710 align:middle line:84%
in an infrastructure that
assumes you want to build out

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:22.630 align:middle line:90%
the North American Union.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.260 align:middle line:90%
So if, for example--

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.930 align:middle line:84%
I spent a lot of
time on the road

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:27.334 align:middle line:90%
driving around the country.

00:10:27.334 --> 00:10:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
at, they're really

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.650 align:middle line:90%
setting up the infrastructure--

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:36.460 align:middle line:84%
railroads, trucking-- for
Canada, Mexico, and the US

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.080 align:middle line:90%
to be a merged market.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.070 align:middle line:84%
So there are investments
in infrastructure.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And my belief is that
the investment that's

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.410 align:middle line:84%
being made underground has also
been very, very significant.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.770 align:middle line:84%
So there is a lot of significant
infrastructure going on.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.230 align:middle line:84%
It's just if you're walking
around on the surface

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:54.689 align:middle line:84%
and you're the
general population--

00:10:54.689 --> 00:10:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're not seeing it.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: You're not seeing it.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to Europe, or
you go to the Middle East,

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.181 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing a
first-world infrastructure.

00:11:02.181 --> 00:11:04.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know because
you spend a lot of time

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.185 align:middle line:90%
in Europe, too.

00:11:05.185 --> 00:11:08.350 align:middle line:84%
It's very humiliating to travel
around Europe and think, wow,

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.360 align:middle line:84%
this is how the first
world lives because we

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.020 align:middle line:90%
don't live that way anymore.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.395 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't
live that way.

00:11:12.395 --> 00:11:14.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's interesting
to drive around in India,

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.580 align:middle line:84%
and come back and have
worse roads in California.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.380 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know our
rural country roads,

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.822 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing but
potholes and patches.

00:11:22.822 --> 00:11:25.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know the last
time that thing was paved.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.613 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: And what's
very interesting--

00:11:26.613 --> 00:11:30.139 align:middle line:84%
I've spent my lifetime drilling
down into government budgets.

00:11:30.139 --> 00:11:31.930 align:middle line:84%
In the '90s, we were
making a software tool

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.120 align:middle line:84%
that would make all
the federal budgets

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.920 align:middle line:90%
available on a community basis.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.624 align:middle line:84%
So you could see sources and
uses of government money.

00:11:38.624 --> 00:11:40.540 align:middle line:84%
If you drilled down and
look at the government

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:47.095 align:middle line:84%
money, what you know is there's
terrible, terrible waste.

00:11:47.095 --> 00:11:50.080 align:middle line:84%
The government money
is being engineered

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.960 align:middle line:84%
for political control
and to get people to go

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.970 align:middle line:84%
along as opposed to really
optimizing anything,

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:57.530 align:middle line:90%
including the infrastructure.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:01.125 align:middle line:84%
We've had enough money to take
care of the roads and bridges.

00:12:01.125 --> 00:12:04.900 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.660 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard for someone who
knows a lot about the budgets

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.500 align:middle line:84%
to not drive around
the country and cry.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And cry.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.620 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.020 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.360 align:middle line:90%
What we'll do here is--

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.824 align:middle line:84%
we wanted to bring
up one example,

00:12:17.824 --> 00:12:19.990 align:middle line:84%
because it just kind of
gives an indication of where

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.100 align:middle line:90%
things might be headed.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.340 align:middle line:84%
A major military
industrial contractor

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.800 align:middle line:84%
has a large contract with
the Department of Defense.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell us
what's going on there?

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:30.240 align:middle line:90%
And why this is so significant?

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: It's really
interesting because I

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.500 align:middle line:84%
was in Washington when the
financial coup started.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.080 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't get
anybody interested.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.980 align:middle line:84%
You had hundreds of billions
of dollars flying out the door.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, all these
investment managers

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.190 align:middle line:90%
had windfalls of money.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.450 align:middle line:90%
No one knew where they come--

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.010 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't get
anybody interested.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.990 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, Enron is blooming
and all these other people

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.790 align:middle line:90%
are ballooning.

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.350 align:middle line:90%
And nobody's interested.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:54.300 align:middle line:90%
You know why?

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.646 align:middle line:84%
They're all talking
about Monica Lewinsky.

00:12:56.646 --> 00:12:59.380 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:03.280 align:middle line:84%
I was online looking at the
news about two months ago

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and I said, you know, I've
been to this movie before.

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.642 align:middle line:84%
Because there was so
much disinformation.

00:13:08.642 --> 00:13:09.850 align:middle line:90%
I call it the shriek-o-meter.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.190 align:middle line:84%
The shriek-o-meter
was full blast.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I've
been here before.

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, it's
Monica Lewinsky two.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.264 align:middle line:90%
Here we go again.

00:13:19.264 --> 00:13:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
started to look.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.550 align:middle line:90%
OK, where's the money?

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.212 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's going
on underneath it?

00:13:22.212 --> 00:13:23.462 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Money's disappearing.

00:13:23.462 --> 00:13:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Inspector
General, we talked about,

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.360 align:middle line:84%
made their
announcement in August.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.300 align:middle line:84%
The month before, the
largest defense contractor

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.330 align:middle line:84%
and the largest government
contractor in the country spun

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.840 align:middle line:84%
their IT division out into a new
smaller company that had been

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.960 align:middle line:84%
created to spin out another
defense contractor's--

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.110 align:middle line:90%
to do a similar spin out.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:45.180 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, no.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:45.490 align:middle line:90%
Because this is--

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And tell us the
implication of what that means.

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: This is a
major power position.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:53.710 align:middle line:84%
To run a lot of the
information and payment systems

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:57.040 align:middle line:84%
at the largest agency
in the government

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.430 align:middle line:84%
and across the
government, that's

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.010 align:middle line:84%
an amazing thing, especially
when you're the largest weapons

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.720 align:middle line:90%
provider to the government.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.980 align:middle line:90%
You're paying yourself.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.800 align:middle line:84%
So for them to
spin that off, that

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.630 align:middle line:84%
tells me they've got enough
money now to cut and run.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And they're better off
getting the liability

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.480 align:middle line:90%
off their balance sheet.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.280 align:middle line:90%
Now, as--

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The government
being the liability?

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Here's the thing.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.470 align:middle line:84%
If you are a contractor
and you are affecting

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:29.670 align:middle line:84%
illegal transactions, or you
are a bank depository affecting

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.930 align:middle line:84%
illegal transactions,
I believe you're

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.600 align:middle line:84%
liable for all the
money that went missing.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And I happen to have litigated
with the Department of Justice

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:38.980 align:middle line:90%
just on this point.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.610 align:middle line:84%
So you have liabilities if you
were affecting transactions

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.380 align:middle line:90%
outside the law.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And you certainly have
political liability.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.060 align:middle line:84%
So if I were
running the company,

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.360 align:middle line:84%
I would certainly want that
liability off my balance sheet.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.856 align:middle line:84%
So this is conjecture because
I don't have privy to why

00:14:55.856 --> 00:14:56.980 align:middle line:90%
they did and what they did.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.369 align:middle line:90%
But the timing is interesting.

00:14:58.369 --> 00:14:59.851 align:middle line:84%
One month before
the announcement.

00:14:59.851 --> 00:15:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So I started
to look through what

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.970 align:middle line:84%
was going on with cut and run
in other parts of the economy.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.257 align:middle line:90%
So I'll give you an example.

00:15:06.257 --> 00:15:08.590 align:middle line:84%
I just published something
called "Unanswered Questions"

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.840 align:middle line:90%
about the Wells Fargo scandal.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, they created 1.5
million phony accounts

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.620 align:middle line:90%
and 500,000 phony credit cards.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.610 align:middle line:84%
But you know and I both
know, the big money

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.640 align:middle line:84%
is in the phony mortgages
and the phony auto loans.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.940 align:middle line:84%
The Fed now has $1.7 trillion
of mortgage-backed securities

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.899 align:middle line:90%
on their balance sheet.

00:15:26.899 --> 00:15:27.940 align:middle line:90%
Are those real mortgages?

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.400 align:middle line:84%
Or, are those are
phony mortgages?

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:29.945 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are those
fake mortgages?

00:15:29.945 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.359 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Because phony
mortgages would give the system

00:15:32.359 --> 00:15:34.100 align:middle line:90%
a lot more juice.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So everywhere you turn there
are signs of cut and run.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And I was amazed the
Wells Fargo thing

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:41.360 align:middle line:90%
happened before the election.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.680 align:middle line:84%
But I was astonished that not
one senator asked the question,

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.046 align:middle line:84%
what else is associated
with these phony accounts?

00:15:48.046 --> 00:15:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No kidding.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And she got 100-and-some
million dollar bail--

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:55.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, golden parachute
for that one, didn't she?

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Oh, the--
clearly, the officer

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.604 align:middle line:90%
was doing what she was told.

00:16:01.604 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:84%
She was clearly doing
what she was told.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.895 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was
given a massive bonus

00:16:04.895 --> 00:16:05.720 align:middle line:90%
to just disappear.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.197 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think if we dig down
and look into the mortgage

00:16:10.197 --> 00:16:11.780 align:middle line:84%
securities market,
what we'll discover

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:14.990 align:middle line:84%
is that despite $27
trillion of bailouts,

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.931 align:middle line:84%
we didn't clean up the
outstanding future fraud.

00:16:17.931 --> 00:16:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think probably so.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.220 align:middle line:90%
So here's the question.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.984 align:middle line:84%
For 10 years, I've been odd man
out in the financial community

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:26.900 align:middle line:84%
because I've said, it's
not going to collapse.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.130 align:middle line:90%
It's going to slow burn.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's saying, oh,
it's going down in '12.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:31.010 align:middle line:90%
It's going down--

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: I said no,
it's going to slow burn.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.914 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: And part of that
is because of litigating

00:16:34.914 --> 00:16:36.080 align:middle line:90%
with the federal government.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:40.100 align:middle line:84%
I have extensive experience
and knowledge personally

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.400 align:middle line:84%
of the different techniques they
use to keep the economy slow

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.870 align:middle line:90%
burning along.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.790 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the cut
and run, and then you

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:middle line:84%
look at something
that's happening

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.870 align:middle line:84%
that we need to talk
about in connection

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:54.470 align:middle line:84%
with the Constitution, the
push for a balanced budget

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:58.160 align:middle line:84%
amendment, which I describe
as I steal $50 trillion,

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.560 align:middle line:84%
and then after I've got
the money, I say, no.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.200 align:middle line:90%
Now we balance the budget.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And you have to put in enough
money to handle the liabilities

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:10.369 align:middle line:90%
or we abrogate the contracts.

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:13.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a double
[INAUDIBLE] if you will.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.361 align:middle line:84%
I think we're coming
into what I would

00:17:16.361 --> 00:17:17.569 align:middle line:90%
call a controlled demolition.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:20.990 align:middle line:84%
They can't keep the slow burn
going without overhauling

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:22.410 align:middle line:90%
institutions.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what do timeframes
look like with a controlled

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:27.619 align:middle line:90%
demolition?

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Because you've been giving
it some space until now.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.290 align:middle line:84%
So now, the runway
is much shorter.

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And the question is, how
is this going to play out?

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.640 align:middle line:90%
And I have no idea.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nobody seems to.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: I'm a
believer that we have

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:42.050 align:middle line:84%
to get out of the business
of predicting a future

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:44.160 align:middle line:84%
and get into the business
of inventing the future.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Because we
have a group of people

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:47.926 align:middle line:90%
inventing our future for us.

00:17:47.926 --> 00:17:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at what I call
the controlled demolition,

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.310 align:middle line:90%
it does not look pretty.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we need to get
back into inventing it ourself.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And the thing I would stress
about the economics is,

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.130 align:middle line:90%
if you--

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:04.370 align:middle line:84%
let's just take a
simple company being

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.260 align:middle line:90%
run by a competent person.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.160 align:middle line:84%
If you put somebody in
charge who's saying one thing

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.040 align:middle line:84%
and doing another, and engaging
in criminality, what's going

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.687 align:middle line:90%
to happen to that company?

00:18:14.687 --> 00:18:15.770 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to do well.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not going to do well.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.120 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've kept that
going for 50 years

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.850 align:middle line:84%
by borrowing more
and more money.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.560 align:middle line:84%
My favorite quote
of the year so far

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.950 align:middle line:84%
is from the German
Finance Minister, who

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:31.220 align:middle line:84%
at the G20 meeting in
China in February said,

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.260 align:middle line:84%
the debt finance
growth model is over.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.240 align:middle line:84%
There are no shortcuts
that are not real reforms.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.780 align:middle line:90%
So party's over.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying they
can't trickle along.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:43.090 align:middle line:84%
But essentially,
the party's over.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And so we're all going
to have to change.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is what
looks like it's hopeless,

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:51.260 align:middle line:84%
if you put the right
people in charge

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.500 align:middle line:84%
and you run it to
optimize it, there's

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.660 align:middle line:84%
plenty of good news
in the economy.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.660 align:middle line:84%
But I used to have a
pastor in Washington say,

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.480 align:middle line:90%
God does not bless a mess.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:90%


00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:84%
This is good,
old-fashioned, simple rules

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.180 align:middle line:90%
of running things right.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And you have to have a system
that's based on the law.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Because economies work
on faith and trust.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Without faith and trust,
you can have no economy.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.252 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to run an
economy globally enforced.

00:19:22.252 --> 00:19:23.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to work.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:25.320 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have been
centralizing the economy.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.764 align:middle line:84%
We've been using dirty
tricks and crime to do it.

00:19:31.764 --> 00:19:33.680 align:middle line:84%
We've been saying one
thing and doing another.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:37.794 align:middle line:84%
And that centralization has
made the 1% of 1% very wealthy,

00:19:37.794 --> 00:19:38.710 align:middle line:90%
but it shrunk the pie.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to keep shrinking
the pie unless we change.

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:46.730 align:middle line:90%
So let's delve into that.

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:50.270 align:middle line:84%
One of the things we talked
about off-camera that's really,

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.640 align:middle line:84%
perhaps the greatest
obstacle in this--

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and we'll just get that
out, so we can get past it.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
notion of entrainment

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.650 align:middle line:84%
and what is happening to
us psychologically in mass.

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:02.210 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:04.870 align:middle line:84%
One of the critical
tools they've

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.980 align:middle line:84%
used to keep the slow
burn going, I believe,

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.400 align:middle line:90%
is entrainment technology.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:14.270 align:middle line:84%
I was on Wall Street in 1984,
and I overheard a conversation

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.980 align:middle line:84%
about it for the first time,
that I wasn't supposed to hear.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.770 align:middle line:90%
And it scared me to death.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:19.770 align:middle line:90%
And I gave up my TV.

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.140 align:middle line:90%
I haven't had a TV since then.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.425 align:middle line:90%
Now, wait a minute.

00:20:23.425 --> 00:20:25.425 align:middle line:90%
Who are you overhearing?

00:20:25.425 --> 00:20:26.225 align:middle line:90%
And without names.

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Two very powerful
people on Wall Street.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Two very--

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
was the nature

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.880 align:middle line:90%
of what they were saying?

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Basically,
they were saying

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.200 align:middle line:84%
that TV was going to be
used to manipulate people's

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.020 align:middle line:90%
minds without them knowing.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.330 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
tangential for a minute,

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:46.340 align:middle line:84%
because we talked about this
a couple of days ago prepping.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:49.920 align:middle line:84%
You said, by the
way, go on YouTube

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.550 align:middle line:84%
and watch a brawl at
a Chuck E. Cheese.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:58.577 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I immediately
was thinking the film with--

00:20:58.577 --> 00:20:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: "Kingsman."

00:20:59.410 --> 00:20:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "Kingsman."

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Her Majesty's
Secret Service, yes.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.750 align:middle line:84%
"Kingsman," which I
had everybody watch.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:06.240 align:middle line:84%
I said, I swear to
God, they're telling us

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.710 align:middle line:90%
this technology exists.

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:09.150 align:middle line:90%
So give us a link between that.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:10.650 align:middle line:84%
In case anyone
wants to go and look

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:12.120 align:middle line:90%
for the Chuck E. Cheese brawl.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.995 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So the great
thing about Hollywood

00:21:14.995 --> 00:21:16.120 align:middle line:90%
is they tell us everything.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They do.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: They do.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.745 align:middle line:84%
So we had a whole
series of mind control--

00:21:20.745 --> 00:21:24.210 align:middle line:90%


00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:26.299 align:middle line:84%
or TV or movie
about mind control.

00:21:26.299 --> 00:21:27.840 align:middle line:84%
So we had "The
Manchurian Candidate."

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.060 align:middle line:84%
We had the remake of "The
Manchurian Candidate."

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.830 align:middle line:84%
We had "Telefon"
with Charles Bronson.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:36.135 align:middle line:84%
We had-- what was that
wonderful one with Geena Davis

00:21:36.135 --> 00:21:38.010 align:middle line:84%
and Samuel Jackson--
you know, Samuel Jackson

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:39.180 align:middle line:90%
is always in these movies.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:40.380 align:middle line:90%
He does a lot of that.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: But it
was all about mind

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:42.944 align:middle line:90%
controlling the individual.

00:21:42.944 --> 00:21:47.965 align:middle line:84%
Or, is about TV
influencing as propaganda.

00:21:47.965 --> 00:21:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: "Wag the
Dog" was a good one.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: "Wag the
Dog" was a great one.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.490 align:middle line:84%
But now we see with
the "Kingsman."

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:56.250 align:middle line:84%
"Kingsman" came out, I think,
two years ago, one year ago?

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:58.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think it was 2014.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: But it was really
using cell tower and cell

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.690 align:middle line:90%
technology, SIM cards.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Samuel Jackson plays a
billionaire, a Silicon Valley

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:07.900 align:middle line:90%
billionaire.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.600 align:middle line:90%
And he hands out free SIM cards.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.100 align:middle line:90%
So low-cost.

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And proceeds to use
mind control technology

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.930 align:middle line:84%
through the SIM cards
to manipulate people

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:16.875 align:middle line:90%
in a variety of ways.

00:22:16.875 --> 00:22:19.560 align:middle line:90%


00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:24.480 align:middle line:84%
First, he uses the
technology to get the crowd

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.290 align:middle line:84%
to behave in a variety
of different ways,

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:28.890 align:middle line:84%
including getting 200
people in a Southern Church

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.270 align:middle line:84%
to jump up and kill each
other at a Sunday service

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.150 align:middle line:84%
where they're
talking about love.

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:35.790 align:middle line:84%
The other thing he
does is he basically

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:37.140 align:middle line:90%
chips the world's leaders.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:38.310 align:middle line:90%
So they have microchips.

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't do
what they're told,

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.040 align:middle line:90%
their head explodes.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Fortunately,
when their head explodes,

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.420 align:middle line:84%
if anyone wants
to watch it, it's

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.990 align:middle line:90%
kind of rainbow-colored stuff.

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:52.345 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: But you know,
it's a very gruesome movie.

00:22:52.345 --> 00:22:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.303 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: And I try and get
people to watch it just

00:22:55.303 --> 00:22:57.305 align:middle line:84%
to understand that
this stuff exists.

00:22:57.305 --> 00:22:59.179 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:22:59.179 --> 00:23:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: One of my
favorite Solari Reports.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.850 align:middle line:84%
I have many favorite
Solari Reports.

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:05.370 align:middle line:84%
We did an interview on
entrainment technology

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:08.760 align:middle line:84%
because my clients were being
manipulated by this stuff.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.872 align:middle line:84%
And I literally needed them
to understand that it exists.

00:23:12.872 --> 00:23:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Because if you understand
this technology

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.380 align:middle line:84%
exists and can be
used in a conference.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.240 align:middle line:84%
It can be used in a
phone call when somebody

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.860 align:middle line:90%
is pitching you an investment.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:25.069 align:middle line:84%
If you know it exists, then that
is your first line of defense.

00:23:25.069 --> 00:23:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was this
with Adam Trombly?

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Yes.

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:30.810 align:middle line:84%
He had sat me down in front of
a big flat-screen TV and giving

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:32.340 align:middle line:90%
me a whole--

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:36.200 align:middle line:84%
the scientist's explanation
of how this all goes--

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.470 align:middle line:90%
it goes in one ear.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.395 align:middle line:84%
If it's not money,
I don't retain it.

00:23:39.395 --> 00:23:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know, I get it.

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: But anyway, so he
explained the whole thing.

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And in the Solari Report,
he explains the whole thing.

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:49.920 align:middle line:84%
I had just had an
experience with both

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.560 align:middle line:84%
having it used in a
conference, and then

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.510 align:middle line:84%
having it used with
some of my clients.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And literally, having
wars to talk them out.

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:01.500 align:middle line:84%
I literally had to say,
there is a 100% chance

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:05.276 align:middle line:84%
you will lose all your money
and they still want to do it.

00:24:05.276 --> 00:24:06.650 align:middle line:90%
It's scary.

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you knew this was
happening at the conference?

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Yes.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: I knew
it was happening.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Because interestingly
enough, I had just gotten--

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Adam explained to
me how it worked.

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:24.150 align:middle line:84%
But I had been researching
Enron at the time.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And I was convinced from
reading the transcripts

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:29.700 align:middle line:84%
of how enthusiastic the
analysts were when they came out

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.140 align:middle line:90%
of the meeting.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.830 align:middle line:84%
You would read the
transcript and you would see

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:36.180 align:middle line:90%
the presentation they'd made.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And then you would hear their
enthusiasm and you would say--

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This doesn't connect.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: It doesn't connect.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:45.210 align:middle line:84%
These people are resonating
very powerfully--

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
talking frequency?

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Yeah.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:48.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Yeah.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.060 align:middle line:90%
So my theory was--

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:54.510 align:middle line:90%
again, high octane speculation.

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.400 align:middle line:84%
My theory was that
it was entrainment.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.590 align:middle line:90%
But it was very interesting.

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:00.780 align:middle line:84%
I walked into the room
and I could feel it.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:02.010 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh my god.

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:03.270 align:middle line:90%
It's entrainment.

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:06.870 align:middle line:84%
So I have to be very
disciplined about reacting.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:08.520 align:middle line:84%
I sat down and I
was taking notes.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.550 align:middle line:90%
And at one point--

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.650 align:middle line:84%
the speech was
not a good speech,

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:15.810 align:middle line:84%
but it was getting a very
positive reaction because

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:17.750 align:middle line:90%
of this presentation.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.675 align:middle line:84%
I focused on getting
something down in my notes.

00:25:20.675 --> 00:25:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And as I did that,
I stopped thinking,

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:24.930 align:middle line:90%
I need to control my mind.

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:26.490 align:middle line:90%
I need to control my mind.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:28.082 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly put down
my pen and started

00:25:28.082 --> 00:25:30.665 align:middle line:84%
clapping, turned to the next guy
and said, isn't he wonderful?

00:25:30.665 --> 00:25:32.220 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, no, he's not.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.780 align:middle line:90%
What am I saying?

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:39.330 align:middle line:84%
So even knowing that it
existed, it was only--

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:40.260 align:middle line:90%
I forgive myself.

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.084 align:middle line:90%
It was only 5 or 10 seconds.

00:25:42.084 --> 00:25:43.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have
dealt with people

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.560 align:middle line:84%
and interviewed people
who were subjects of that.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.450 align:middle line:84%
But to see how
it's done so we can

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:50.340 align:middle line:84%
be alert to what it
might-- like you say,

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.170 align:middle line:84%
you can feel it when
you walk in the room.

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:52.455 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:25:52.455 --> 00:25:54.450 align:middle line:84%
So right now I've been
working on a cheat sheet

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:56.910 align:middle line:90%
for my subscribers.

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:58.410 align:middle line:84%
After watching the
"Kingsman," I was

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:00.840 align:middle line:84%
convinced that this was
going to be prototyped.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think in some of the riot
situations, it's being used.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I thought so, too.

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:03.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: In the soft
revolution, it's being used.

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:11.940 align:middle line:84%
But when I saw the videos of
the Chuck E. Cheese brawl,

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm absolutely sure.

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was crazy.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.213 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, it's been
happening all over the country.

00:26:17.213 --> 00:26:18.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not the only one.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:20.160 align:middle line:90%
And I think they're prototyping.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And that was the last
thing that convinced me,

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.900 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're coming into a
controlled demolition.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Because if they need this
technology next year,

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.730 align:middle line:90%
it's because--

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:33.600 align:middle line:84%
remember, what you're
trying to do-- whenever

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:38.010 align:middle line:84%
the population feels that
they don't want to pay taxes

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:40.620 align:middle line:90%
into a system which is corrupt.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And they literally
feel an obligation

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.120 align:middle line:84%
to enforce the Constitution
and the laws related

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.740 align:middle line:90%
to financial management.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, you get
violent things happening.

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:52.200 align:middle line:84%
At which point, the population
says, oh, we need government.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And you can literally
watch the polls.

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:57.900 align:middle line:84%
If here's the line under which
you stop paying your taxes,

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.920 align:middle line:90%
the polls go like this.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.086 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly, you have violence.

00:27:00.086 --> 00:27:00.900 align:middle line:90%
It comes back up.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.730 align:middle line:84%
To justify defense
and everything else.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:05.611 align:middle line:90%
To justify your need.

00:27:05.611 --> 00:27:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as
government marketing.

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:10.770 align:middle line:90%


00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:14.070 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: When the war on terror
runs out of legs, what's next?

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:19.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, what's next is weaponizing
the general population.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.430 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the thing.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:23.185 align:middle line:84%
If we know-- because you know
I believe the choice is coming

00:27:23.185 --> 00:27:25.185 align:middle line:84%
down to, are we going to
be a human civilization

00:27:25.185 --> 00:27:28.650 align:middle line:90%
or an inhuman civilization?

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:30.150 align:middle line:84%
The thing that
frightens me the most

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:32.670 align:middle line:84%
is not what's happening
to the general population

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:34.740 align:middle line:90%
with the technology.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.480 align:middle line:84%
The thing that
frightens me most is

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.990 align:middle line:84%
you're watching the
establishment who's

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:44.490 align:middle line:84%
leading the economy and leading
the governmental structures

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:46.910 align:middle line:84%
literally forget
what reality is.

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:49.320 align:middle line:84%
There is a blowback from
using this technology.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.350 align:middle line:84%
The general population
loses sight of reality.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And then, you lose
sight of the fact--

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:58.680 align:middle line:84%
the establishment loses
sight of the reality, too.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.582 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:59.582 --> 00:28:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: And you start
depending on this stuff.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're all living
in a video game more or less.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And so if we're going to
move in a positive direction,

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:08.982 align:middle line:90%
we need to get our mind back.

00:28:08.982 --> 00:28:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I couldn't
agree more with you.

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So number one for
you, turn the TV off

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:15.630 align:middle line:84%
because they're using these
frequencies in the messaging

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:16.915 align:middle line:90%
and embedded into programming?

00:28:16.915 --> 00:28:17.715 align:middle line:90%
Is that part of it?

00:28:17.715 --> 00:28:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: I think
this is everything.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.032 align:middle line:90%
I think it's not just TV.

00:28:20.032 --> 00:28:21.240 align:middle line:90%
I think it's the smartphones.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.380 align:middle line:90%
I think it's the internet.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.430 align:middle line:90%
I think it's all of it.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:25.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: G5 is
about to come out.

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:27.680 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to have
just devastating effects.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do an
interview on that very soon.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.100 align:middle line:84%
But what have you
heard about G5?

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And what are those potentials
with entrainment even with G5?

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: I think it's
going to be very powerful.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Because you can
literally persuade

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.960 align:middle line:84%
people that the
virtual world is more

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.360 align:middle line:90%
attractive than the real world.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And they can literally choose to
live within the virtual world.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful--
if you've ever

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:56.100 align:middle line:84%
watched what can be done with
the hologram technology once 5G

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.050 align:middle line:90%
rolls out, it's extraordinary.

00:28:58.050 --> 00:28:59.742 align:middle line:90%
And it's very powerful.

00:28:59.742 --> 00:29:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And it could be
used for great use.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.840 align:middle line:84%
For education, for
all these things.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But total
manipulation and enticement?

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:06.900 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I don't know what's
going to happen, Regina.

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:14.550 align:middle line:84%
I think, again, it comes
down to human versus inhuman.

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Can you use these
technologies to sell inhuman?

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:18.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:19.800 align:middle line:90%
Can you use them to sell human?

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's
going to happen

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:28.740 align:middle line:84%
is you're going to have a group
of people insist on human.

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And the question is, can
you have a critical mass?

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.150 align:middle line:90%
You don't need a lot.

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:36.420 align:middle line:84%
You don't need a lot, that's
sort of the secret ingredient

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.165 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:29:39.165 --> 00:29:42.090 align:middle line:84%
You may remember this, my
favorite story in the Bible

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:44.400 align:middle line:90%
is the story of Gideon's army.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Gideon comes down the
mountain with 300 people

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:52.110 align:middle line:84%
with no weapons, just lanterns
and pitchers, vibration.

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And the Midianites are
so hateful and suspicious

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:59.880 align:middle line:84%
of each other, they jump up
in the valley in the dark

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.480 align:middle line:90%
and kill each other.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is you cannot
lead a civilization with this

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.900 align:middle line:90%
level of perversion.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:07.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, you can't.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: You can't.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.040 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't take
a lot, but we need

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:16.950 align:middle line:84%
enough people who are pro
human to kind of organize.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And many of the
people in this country

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:20.670 align:middle line:84%
have been in the
middle of the road.

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:22.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, because we
want to get along.

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:24.390 align:middle line:90%
We want to go along.

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:26.409 align:middle line:84%
And what they're finally
beginning to realize

00:30:26.409 --> 00:30:28.200 align:middle line:84%
is they're going along
with something which

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.750 align:middle line:90%
is essentially psychopathic.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And so now we're being
forced to choose.

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Every year for my
whole life just about,

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.110 align:middle line:84%
every four years I
despair that we're

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:41.693 align:middle line:84%
going to spend all
this time and money

00:30:41.693 --> 00:30:43.350 align:middle line:90%
on a presidential campaign.

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And this year, I thought,
oh, here we go again.

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And who would have
ever predicted

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:51.060 align:middle line:84%
that it would end up having
really meaningful discussions

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.070 align:middle line:90%
about really meaningful issues?

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So getting
back a basis for faith

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.490 align:middle line:84%
again, of some kind--
it doesn't matter what

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:01.440 align:middle line:90%
your religion or your bent is.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.980 align:middle line:84%
But getting back a
spiritual basis for life

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.680 align:middle line:84%
that has ethics,
and has morality,

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.416 align:middle line:84%
and clear thinking
and coherence,

00:31:09.416 --> 00:31:10.290 align:middle line:90%
which you talk about.

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:11.090 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Coherence.

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:13.120 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite times
in the Solari Report

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.204 align:middle line:90%
is Bill Tiller-- have you?

00:31:14.204 --> 00:31:15.003 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:15.003 --> 00:31:16.000 align:middle line:90%
I've interviewed him.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:16.800 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: OK.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So Bill Tiller, I was doing
the pre-interview interview.

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him,
I was so excited

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:25.110 align:middle line:84%
because I thought
he'd be really--

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:28.170 align:middle line:84%
he did the research on proving
that human intention could

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:29.195 align:middle line:90%
change material reality.

00:31:29.195 --> 00:31:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:30.465 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Including
at great distances.

00:31:30.465 --> 00:31:32.716 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That Lynne McTaggart
ultimately spun-off on.

00:31:32.716 --> 00:31:33.515 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:31:33.515 --> 00:31:34.770 align:middle line:90%
And very exciting stuff.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:36.270 align:middle line:90%
We've had Lynne McTaggart on.

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's essential
to understand those things,

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:41.430 align:middle line:90%
to understand our world.

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:43.110 align:middle line:90%
So I said, oh, Dr. Tiller.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:44.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm very excited about
community prayer.

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:46.280 align:middle line:90%
What do you think?

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, you
have to be very careful.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:52.230 align:middle line:84%
He said, if the people doing the
praying are coherent, it helps.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:54.690 align:middle line:84%
If they're incoherent,
it makes it worse.

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:56.378 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:31:56.378 --> 00:31:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: And the
bells started ringing.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:03.480 align:middle line:84%
I said, oh, what I need to
do is to be more coherent.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And this whole notion of where
two or more gather, yes and no.

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is something I was
taught in my spiritual guidance

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.520 align:middle line:84%
decades ago, was you can
get together with people,

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.660 align:middle line:90%
do your meditations.

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:18.420 align:middle line:84%
But it really will have
little powerful effect

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.810 align:middle line:84%
if you're not of single purpose,
single mind, and coherent.

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:23.050 align:middle line:90%
Exactly what you told me.

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:28.440 align:middle line:84%
So we each have a responsibility
to our entire civilization

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.480 align:middle line:84%
to be coherent in
and of ourselves.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when I talk to
people about what can we do,

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.450 align:middle line:84%
it's extremely
important that you only

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:38.700 align:middle line:84%
do that which you can do
from a place of coherence

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.140 align:middle line:90%
and maintaining coherence.

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you have
to have a direction

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:44.251 align:middle line:90%
and know where you want to go.

00:32:44.251 --> 00:32:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: My favorite--
when I worked

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:48.810 align:middle line:84%
in the federal government, I
was cleaning up the HUD scandal.

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was quite
messy and organic.

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And I had a wonderful
deputy who used

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:56.430 align:middle line:84%
to say, in the
destruction of the old,

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:58.710 align:middle line:84%
let there be the
creation of the new.

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And what he meant by that
is, when you're cleaning up,

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.561 align:middle line:84%
there's not time to
clean up the mess

00:33:02.561 --> 00:33:04.510 align:middle line:84%
and then start and
design a new system.

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:06.870 align:middle line:84%
In other words, as
this is falling down,

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:09.350 align:middle line:84%
you have to pick up the
flotsam and the jetsam

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:10.660 align:middle line:90%
and start building arks.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And so you have to have a very
clear picture of where you're

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.510 align:middle line:90%
going and what your purpose is.

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:22.200 align:middle line:84%
So faith and an understanding
of my individual divine purpose

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.350 align:middle line:84%
is essential for navigating
this environment.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, as we were
talking about a moment ago,

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:33.570 align:middle line:84%
the entrainment is
what really interrupts

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:34.650 align:middle line:90%
a lot of this coherence.

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:37.650 align:middle line:84%
We'll just tie that for a
nanosecond back into that.

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:40.920 align:middle line:84%
The goal of the
entrainment is to get

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.820 align:middle line:84%
you to resonate with
a machinery that's

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:48.370 align:middle line:84%
directing you to the
purpose the machine wants.

00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:49.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:51.390 align:middle line:84%
So think of it as
harvesting machinery.

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:53.220 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
get you to resonate

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.770 align:middle line:84%
with the machinery
that's harvesting you

00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:57.480 align:middle line:90%
instead of your divine purpose.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.500 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.982 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you need to
have time for contemplation.

00:34:00.982 --> 00:34:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Go hug a tree.

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:03.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hug a tree.

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:07.595 align:middle line:84%
Sit on a rock long enough
to say, how would I

00:34:07.595 --> 00:34:09.719 align:middle line:84%
live in an ideal-- if this
were an ideal world, how

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:10.840 align:middle line:90%
do I want to live?

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.440 align:middle line:84%
So that's question number
1, how do I want to live?

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.150 align:middle line:90%
How can I effectively go there?

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:17.670 align:middle line:90%
What really matters to me?

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: What's
in my heart to do.

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:22.889 align:middle line:84%
Not what the machinery
is trying to trick me.

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:24.389 align:middle line:90%
But what's in my heart to do?

00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:26.731 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And nature is
a really good touchstone

00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:28.230 align:middle line:84%
for being able to
find that clarity.

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:30.626 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Take your shoes off
and put your feet on the ground.

00:34:30.626 --> 00:34:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.889 align:middle line:84%
Get grounded and ask yourself
a couple of critical questions.

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:37.139 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: I was litigating
with the federal government.

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:41.124 align:middle line:84%
And if there is anything that
will make you incoherent,

00:34:41.124 --> 00:34:41.924 align:middle line:90%
it's--

00:34:41.924 --> 00:34:42.199 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:44.282 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: ----[INAUDIBLE]
discovery and litigation.

00:34:44.282 --> 00:34:45.594 align:middle line:90%
You know, serious litigation.

00:34:45.594 --> 00:34:47.969 align:middle line:84%
And there were two things that
could always bring me back

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:48.769 align:middle line:90%
to coherence.

00:34:48.769 --> 00:34:52.080 align:middle line:84%
One was my cousin's cow
pasture is right behind me.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.219 align:middle line:90%
So I'd go talk to the cows.

00:34:53.219 --> 00:34:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And the cows would look at
me like, you need to chill.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.140 align:middle line:90%
And the other was Bach.

00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Bach can always bring me
back to a state of coherence.

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:03.622 align:middle line:84%
So we have to find our means
of finding our coherence?

00:35:03.622 --> 00:35:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Yeah, exactly.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bach or otherwise.

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Yeah.

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:08.270 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And we're going through
what is a pretty long list

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:14.130 align:middle line:84%
of amazing tools we
have at our disposal.

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:16.290 align:middle line:90%
Another one is crowdfunding.

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:17.310 align:middle line:90%
Nourishing your culture.

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:18.684 align:middle line:84%
And you told me
a little story, I

00:35:18.684 --> 00:35:20.250 align:middle line:84%
think it was about
Joseph Farrell.

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:24.000 align:middle line:84%
You have a relationship
there professionally.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And what his passion is and
what you're doing about it.

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:30.112 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: We had a magical
moment two years ago.

00:35:30.112 --> 00:35:31.320 align:middle line:90%
He was giving a presentation.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.470 align:middle line:84%
We were giving presentations
together at a workshop.

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And Joseph said, Bach
wrote for the organ.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote, depending on when
you hear him talk about this,

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.710 align:middle line:90%
on 24 or 36 tracks.

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Joseph, as a small child,
learned how to play the organ.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:54.210 align:middle line:84%
And he said, because the
world is very complex,

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:55.110 align:middle line:90%
we have echoes.

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:57.390 align:middle line:84%
We have natural
systems, living systems.

00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:00.270 align:middle line:84%
You need to think on
a 24 or 36-track world

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:02.182 align:middle line:90%
to integrate what's going on.

00:36:02.182 --> 00:36:04.140 align:middle line:84%
He said, but if you listen
to music in America,

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.190 align:middle line:90%
it's become the drumbeat.

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:06.780 align:middle line:90%
It's one track.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And in a unipolar world where
we could force everybody

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:13.320 align:middle line:84%
to do what we wanted, we
could be overly simplistic.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.600 align:middle line:84%
But in a multi-polar
world, we can't.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.210 align:middle line:84%
So we all need to think
again, to learn how

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:20.620 align:middle line:90%
to think on a 24 or 36-track.

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:21.420 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:25.710 align:middle line:84%
So Joseph-- every time I talk
to him about pipe organs,

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:27.150 align:middle line:90%
he just--

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lit up?

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: The joy in his face.

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:33.006 align:middle line:10%
So the last time
I saw him, I said,

00:36:33.006 --> 00:36:34.380 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to start
a crowdfunding

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.940 align:middle line:10%
to raise enough money
to get you a pipe organ.

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:39.226 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me
like I had lost my--

00:36:39.226 --> 00:36:40.350 align:middle line:90%
I said, I'm going to do it.

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:41.150 align:middle line:90%
Watch.

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And so we have the launch
party next Saturday.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And I've been learning all
about the history of pipe

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.220 align:middle line:90%
organs and everything else.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.850 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I've
learned is that the pipe organ

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:53.580 align:middle line:90%
is the music of the divine.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.066 align:middle line:90%
It was the church.

00:36:55.066 --> 00:36:56.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting,
if you go back and look

00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:00.654 align:middle line:84%
at all the movies, it's
the music of space.

00:37:00.654 --> 00:37:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Yeah.

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:05.880 align:middle line:84%
In "Interstellar," Hans
Zimmer used the organ.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:11.640 align:middle line:84%
I have this image of
Joseph as the phantom

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:15.180 align:middle line:84%
of the opera sitting at the
center of our morphogenic field

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.730 align:middle line:84%
playing the organ and
helping us rebuild

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:20.150 align:middle line:90%
our field into 24 to 36 tracks.

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Love it.

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:21.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:23.347 align:middle line:90%
So Joseph's thrilled.

00:37:23.347 --> 00:37:24.930 align:middle line:84%
He's going to have
his own pipe organ.

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: He went out
and bought shoes.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.840 align:middle line:84%
He bought his
organ master shoes.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.589 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny, we
haven't launched yet.

00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:33.630 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have the
launch party on Saturday,

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:34.838 align:middle line:90%
and then launch a week later.

00:37:34.838 --> 00:37:36.900 align:middle line:84%
But two people
already-- we've already

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.610 align:middle line:84%
raised $2,000 from
people who said,

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:40.800 align:middle line:84%
we're so touched that
he bought the shoes.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.627 align:middle line:84%
If he can believe,
we can believe.

00:37:42.627 --> 00:37:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what's
so cool about that is--

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:46.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a really
fun demonstration of it.

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:49.930 align:middle line:84%
But this is something that can
be done within communities,

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:52.590 align:middle line:84%
within families, where
you say, look at this kid.

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:53.800 align:middle line:90%
The kid's a genius.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's put some money in
and support this guy.

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:58.320 align:middle line:90%
We can do this for anybody.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.294 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:37:59.294 --> 00:38:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I mean,
I love the gesture.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.669 align:middle line:84%
But I like the larger
implications of it.

00:38:02.669 --> 00:38:03.918 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: But here's the thing.

00:38:03.918 --> 00:38:05.190 align:middle line:90%
We need to rebuild the field.

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:06.520 align:middle line:84%
We need to cleanse
and rebuild the field.

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do.

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: And so--

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In that case, he's
helping on a large scale.

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Yeah.

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:13.612 align:middle line:84%
And he keeps saying,
well, I don't

00:38:13.612 --> 00:38:14.820 align:middle line:90%
know if I can get good again.

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.080 align:middle line:90%
I said, don't worry.

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Just stay at home and play
and rebuild the field.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.900 align:middle line:84%
So he's going to be our
phantom of the opera.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:22.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:26.440 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to hear it
once he gets good again.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:29.430 align:middle line:84%
One of the next ones is you talk
about the Popsicle index, which

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:30.270 align:middle line:90%
I love.

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And just go ahead and
explain briefly what that is.

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: The Popsicle
index came up

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.570 align:middle line:84%
when I became Assistant
Secretary of Housing.

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:38.220 align:middle line:84%
For the first month
I was being lobbied

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:41.220 align:middle line:84%
by the homebuilders, the
mortgage bankers, the realtors.

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And I had this growing feeling
of just free-floating anxiety.

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:46.537 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't figure
out what it was.

00:38:46.537 --> 00:38:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And then I finally
realized, everybody

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.550 align:middle line:84%
was lobbying me to
make their stock go up,

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:54.210 align:middle line:84%
but nobody was lobbying me to
make places more wonderful.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized was as we
had centralized the economy,

00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:00.270 align:middle line:84%
and run the government
for control as opposed

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:03.090 align:middle line:84%
to optimization, that
what had happened was

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:06.960 align:middle line:84%
we had created a win-lose
relationship between the S&P

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.720 align:middle line:84%
and the well-being of places,
including the environment.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.180 align:middle line:84%
So living systems
and financial systems

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.580 align:middle line:90%
had a win-lose relationship.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:16.200 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well, how
can we turn that around?

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Because in fact, you can create
far more financial wealth

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:20.730 align:middle line:90%
if you do.

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting,
I was subject to dealing

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:25.440 align:middle line:84%
with all sorts of
activists and lobbyists

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.690 align:middle line:84%
from the social community
who wanted to say,

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:31.385 align:middle line:84%
well, let's kill the S&P and
let's just make the Popsicle

00:39:31.385 --> 00:39:32.550 align:middle line:90%
index--

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.620 align:middle line:84%
First, let me explain
the Popsicle index.

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So I decided, I need
a simple expression.

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:40.080 align:middle line:84%
We all know what
the S&P index means.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:43.890 align:middle line:84%
I need a simple index for
the well-being of a place.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And the one I came up with
is the Popsicle index,

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.750 align:middle line:84%
which is the percent of
people in a community who

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:51.600 align:middle line:84%
believe a child can leave their
home, go to the nearest place

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.360 align:middle line:84%
to buy a popsicle, and
come home alone safely.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.500 align:middle line:90%
So let me say it again.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.642 align:middle line:84%
It's the percent of
people who believe

00:39:57.642 --> 00:39:59.850 align:middle line:84%
a child can leave their
home, go to the nearest place

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:02.010 align:middle line:84%
to buy a popsicle, and
come home alone safely.

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:03.360 align:middle line:90%
So when I was a little girl--

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.640 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a very
modest neighborhood

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.200 align:middle line:90%
in West Philadelphia.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was unthinkable
that I couldn't

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:13.170 align:middle line:84%
run up to Spruce Street,
play the pins, come back.

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, anywhere in America, even
in very wealthy neighborhoods,

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:20.100 align:middle line:84%
people do not let their
children roam because they

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.302 align:middle line:90%
don't feel it's safe.

00:40:21.302 --> 00:40:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting,
what I discovered

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:27.470 align:middle line:84%
is that children's safety is
a pretty indicator of people's

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:29.030 align:middle line:84%
general safety,
which is a pretty

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.460 align:middle line:84%
good indicator of
the basic trust

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:34.400 align:middle line:84%
you need for markets
and the economy to work.

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.110 align:middle line:90%
So I decided, OK.

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:37.800 align:middle line:90%
We'll use the Popsicle index.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And my sort of
vision for America

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.310 align:middle line:84%
is getting the Popsicle
index and the S&P index

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:44.810 align:middle line:90%
to be friends.

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:48.470 align:middle line:84%
So making the financial
system and living systems

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.450 align:middle line:90%
contiguous to each other.

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And reengineering how the
financial system works,

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:55.580 align:middle line:84%
so we can all make money
healing the environment

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:57.440 align:middle line:84%
and helping people
be successful.

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
makes total logical sense.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.774 align:middle line:84%
But as you're
talking about this,

00:41:00.774 --> 00:41:03.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking, the perception.

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.740 align:middle line:84%
This is a perception that your
child is safe or not safe.

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:08.565 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't even have
to do with reality.

00:41:08.565 --> 00:41:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you have the kind of
messaging that's going out,

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:14.600 align:middle line:84%
that's be afraid,
be very afraid,

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:18.240 align:middle line:84%
that whole mechanism works
against that ever coming

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.040 align:middle line:90%
to pass--

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: In the early
2000s, we had a war

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:22.850 align:middle line:90%
between Alan Greenspan and me.

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:26.540 align:middle line:84%
The Popsicle index started to
get more and more attention.

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
Alan Greenspan

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:32.390 align:middle line:84%
made a big speech about how
we need indicators which

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:36.740 align:middle line:84%
can be certified by academics
who, of course, are financed

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.900 align:middle line:90%
by bankers.

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And part of the idea
of the Popsicle index

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.900 align:middle line:84%
was your Popsicle index is
whatever you feel it is.

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's what you
perceive your reality to be.

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: I don't care what
any academic says to disagree

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.440 align:middle line:90%
with you, it's what you feel.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:57.150 align:middle line:90%
This is about how you feel.

00:41:57.150 --> 00:42:01.820 align:middle line:90%
And so no academic and no--

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:05.240 align:middle line:84%
no large corporation
and no large university

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.890 align:middle line:84%
financed by a large
corporation can

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:09.220 align:middle line:90%
come and tell you different.

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But the perception--

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.460 align:middle line:84%
I remember a study done-- it
was in Sacramento, probably

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:16.610 align:middle line:84%
a decade ago now, about
the perception of safety.

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:19.010 align:middle line:84%
They talked about various
indexes in the city.

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Is crime up or down compared
to so many years ago?

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And people
overwhelmingly thought

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:26.840 align:middle line:84%
that those statistics
were actually worse

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.040 align:middle line:90%
than they really were.

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Because the media had been
feeding them with the garbage,

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:31.910 align:middle line:90%
be afraid.

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Everything is be
afraid, be afraid.

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Their kid probably could
go down to the corner

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.080 align:middle line:84%
and purchase a
popsicle and come back.

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:41.330 align:middle line:90%
But that wasn't their feeling.

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:43.309 align:middle line:90%
They were afraid by this time.

00:42:43.309 --> 00:42:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Where when we were kids,
we could easily-- nobody

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:46.390 align:middle line:90%
had those kinds of fears.

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:47.035 align:middle line:90%
You just went and did it.

00:42:47.035 --> 00:42:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Actually,
I'm a lot less afraid

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:51.470 align:middle line:84%
of a child roaming
the streets than I

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:53.930 align:middle line:84%
am of going into a
public school and dealing

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:55.965 align:middle line:84%
with the institution--
or a hospital

00:42:55.965 --> 00:42:57.840 align:middle line:84%
and dealing with the
institutional violence.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So I guess all I'm saying is
that entrainment technology,

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:04.520 align:middle line:84%
again, is making people feel
as though they're unsafe.

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.360 align:middle line:90%
And ruining your Popsicle index.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When in
fact, it probably

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:10.110 align:middle line:84%
could come back
holistically, if people

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:11.900 align:middle line:84%
unplugged from a lot
of those perceptions.

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:12.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Yes.

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:15.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: We still
have to grapple

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:22.790 align:middle line:84%
with an institutional
force that wants

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:27.860 align:middle line:84%
to reduce human beings
to essentially livestock.

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:28.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So it's back
to the inhuman again.

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.670 align:middle line:84%
But if we can unplug
from all of that

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:37.329 align:middle line:84%
and go with this agenda
you lay out here,

00:43:37.329 --> 00:43:39.120 align:middle line:84%
we can raise the Popsicle
index once again.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Absolutely.

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's totally
in our control.

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: There's no reason
for poverty that I know of.

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: There's no reason.

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:47.260 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:49.880 align:middle line:84%
So another one is
don't spend time

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:54.080 align:middle line:84%
with people and institutions
that drain your energy.

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: You've got to clean
the bad guys out of your life.

00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:57.470 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:59.040 align:middle line:90%
And I see it all the time.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.700 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful
book, a new book,

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:04.875 align:middle line:84%
on what really happened with
the Madoff scandal called

00:44:04.875 --> 00:44:05.675 align:middle line:90%
"JPMadoff."

00:44:05.675 --> 00:44:07.640 align:middle line:90%
A wonderful website, JPMadoff.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Helen Chaitman, who you
should absolutely interview.

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
the lawyers who dug in--

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Helen Chaitman is one of the
leading attorneys representing

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:19.040 align:middle line:90%
Madoff victims.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.800 align:middle line:84%
One of the things she discovered
digging into the documents

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.110 align:middle line:84%
and finding out what
had really happened.

00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:26.810 align:middle line:90%
She was herself a Madoff victim.

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:29.940 align:middle line:84%
She discovered that, in
fact, for the entire--

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:35.510 align:middle line:84%
from 1990 on approximately,
the Madoff investment advisory

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:38.810 align:middle line:90%
operation had one bank account.

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:40.294 align:middle line:90%
One bank account.

00:44:40.294 --> 00:44:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her, well, who
was the securities custodian?

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:43.600 align:middle line:90%
She said, none.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.120 align:middle line:90%
There was none.

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:48.320 align:middle line:84%
So the money went in and
they never bought securities.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And because there was only
one bank, that bank knew.

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.670 align:middle line:90%
And that bank was JPMorgan.

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:53.990 align:middle line:90%
So they knew.

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, according to
her, 50% of Americans

00:44:57.470 --> 00:45:00.140 align:middle line:84%
directly or indirectly have
an account at JPMorgan.

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:01.486 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:45:01.486 --> 00:45:02.485 align:middle line:90%
It was very interesting.

00:45:02.485 --> 00:45:06.830 align:middle line:84%
In 1997, I was
sitting in my office--

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:12.080 align:middle line:84%
1997, '98-- and I was writing
a check on JPMorgan Chase

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:13.640 align:middle line:90%
private wealth account.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:16.151 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, I'm
banking at the bank that's

00:45:16.151 --> 00:45:17.400 align:middle line:90%
doing all this mortgage fraud.

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:18.200 align:middle line:90%
Why am I doing it?

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I said,
I've got to come clean.

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:23.360 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get these guys
out of my bank account.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.860 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get
them out of my mind.

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:26.730 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get them
out of my pocketbook.

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:28.410 align:middle line:90%
I've got to get them out.

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So are you suggesting
that people move their assets

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:35.460 align:middle line:84%
over to locally-owned banks
or more credible financial

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:36.600 align:middle line:90%
institutions, saving--

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: What you need to do--

00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Credit unions?

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: --is make sure
any custodian you have,

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:44.089 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a bank,
a brokerage account--

00:45:44.089 --> 00:45:45.630 align:middle line:84%
first of all, they're
in the business

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:48.400 align:middle line:84%
of serving retail
customers-- you.

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And that they have
a track record that

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:51.800 align:middle line:90%
is both ethical and competent.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: And they have a minimum
or no conflicts of interest.

00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, if they're regulated
by the federal government,

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:02.270 align:middle line:84%
in that is going to be
some conflicts of interest.

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:03.190 align:middle line:90%
So you can't avoid it.

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:08.400 align:middle line:84%
But there are so many
wonderful bankers and people

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:14.820 align:middle line:84%
in the financial community who
have really been discouraged

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:18.270 align:middle line:84%
terribly by the fact that
no matter what they do,

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:19.800 align:middle line:90%
they have a handicap.

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.690 align:middle line:84%
They're honest and
they're competent.

00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And the customer keeps
supporting the criminal.

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:27.150 align:middle line:84%
So the customer is
going to have to choose.

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:31.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The customer has
to be educated first though,

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:33.480 align:middle line:90%
as to who these companies are.

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:35.580 align:middle line:90%
Who the good guys are.

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:37.830 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, up at Solari, we
have a link called--

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.770 align:middle line:84%
and you can pick it up
easily in a search--

00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:45.090 align:middle line:90%
how to find a good local bank.

00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
why I brought it up,

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:46.780 align:middle line:84%
because I know you
have resources.

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: And anyone can do it.

00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And if you feel uncomfortable
doing it by yourself,

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:52.604 align:middle line:84%
get together with a group
of friends and do it.

00:46:52.604 --> 00:46:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Every bank in the world is
going-- if you call up and say,

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.228 align:middle line:84%
I have five people and we're
looking for a good bank.

00:46:57.228 --> 00:46:59.610 align:middle line:90%
Can we come and talk to you?

00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:01.290 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
get coffee, donuts,

00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:02.608 align:middle line:90%
and a great presentation.

00:47:02.608 --> 00:47:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's what they do

00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:04.680 align:middle line:90%
at my little bank in Sacramento.

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.570 align:middle line:84%
There's always a bowl of
chocolates there, too.

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:07.760 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.950 align:middle line:84%
So you know, the
good guys are there.

00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And the more money switches from
the bad guys to the good guys.

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's something
we can all do.

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Also, this whole
area of coming clean.

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:23.995 align:middle line:84%
And you call it 23 areas of
your life that you can improve.

00:47:23.995 --> 00:47:25.359 align:middle line:90%
Should we delve in?

00:47:25.359 --> 00:47:27.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if we'll
have time for all 23,

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:31.020 align:middle line:84%
but let's say with certainly the
top 15 if we can get to them.

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:32.490 align:middle line:90%
You want to do that?

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Here, I would just
focus on the financial areas.

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:39.210 align:middle line:84%
But essentially,
what we've got to do

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:40.710 align:middle line:84%
is we've got to go
through our life

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:43.870 align:middle line:84%
and we've got to move out
of our life anything that's

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:44.670 align:middle line:90%
straining us.

00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:47.776 align:middle line:84%
I always encourage
people, do a time budget

00:47:47.776 --> 00:47:49.650 align:middle line:84%
and look at the things
that are draining you.

00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:51.984 align:middle line:84%
And then figure out, can you
move them out of your life?

00:47:51.984 --> 00:47:52.783 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Time.

00:47:52.783 --> 00:47:53.890 align:middle line:90%
Not just money, but time.

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Time.

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:55.941 align:middle line:90%
Time is your--

00:47:55.941 --> 00:47:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Biggest asset.

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:57.740 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: It's both.

00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.137 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:47:59.137 --> 00:48:00.720 align:middle line:84%
We have an article,
you can pick it up

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.053 align:middle line:90%
in a search called coming clean.

00:48:02.053 --> 00:48:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And it walks you through all the
different aspects of your life.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:08.256 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I
focus on is finance.

00:48:08.256 --> 00:48:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And that is because one of
the biggest strains that

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:14.310 align:middle line:84%
is happening to people is in
their financial life, both

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:17.520 align:middle line:84%
their income, expenses,
and their investments.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And because the economy is
changing, they need to change.

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:22.050 align:middle line:90%
And they need to not let them--

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:25.200 align:middle line:84%
just stop-- one way you
can make the world better

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.660 align:middle line:90%
is to stop feeding the beast.

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: And so
there's a whole bunch

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:33.240 align:middle line:84%
of steps on the financial
system that I would really

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:34.300 align:middle line:90%
encourage you to look at.

00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:36.470 align:middle line:84%
One is get out of debt
if you possibly can.

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:37.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Two, we're
in a controlled--

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:41.070 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a slow
burn accelerating

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:42.810 align:middle line:90%
into a controlled demolition.

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:44.640 align:middle line:90%
Incomes are flat.

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:47.370 align:middle line:90%
And real inflation--

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:49.290 align:middle line:84%
I know you know
Charles Hugh Smith.

00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Real inflation is
running at a 7% rate.

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:54.060 align:middle line:90%
And so you're getting squeezed.

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And there are ways of
jumping the curve on that.

00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:58.620 align:middle line:84%
One of them is going
through your balance sheet

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and looking at where you can
invest money to permanently

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:03.244 align:middle line:90%
lower your expenses.

00:49:03.244 --> 00:49:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You gave me
an example on the phone.

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.810 align:middle line:90%
I loved it about the--

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:09.870 align:middle line:84%
you're paying too much
for water as an example.

00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: So I had a friend who
was complaining that her water

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:15.322 align:middle line:84%
bill was going up and the yields
on her stocks were going down.

00:49:15.322 --> 00:49:16.530 align:middle line:90%
I said, this is a no-brainer.

00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Sell your stocks
and build a well.

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:22.170 align:middle line:84%
She was in a rural
area where she could.

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:25.380 align:middle line:84%
We've been disintermediated
or intermediated

00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:26.500 align:middle line:90%
on our balance sheet.

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And we need to get into our
balance sheet and say, OK.

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:30.960 align:middle line:90%
Where can I do more for myself?

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Or where can I do more--

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.040 align:middle line:84%
I'll see people who
are getting no yields.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.540 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
stay conservative.

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:39.670 align:middle line:84%
They're getting no yields on
their fixed income portfolio.

00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And yet, all their kids have
mortgages with high interest

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:43.440 align:middle line:90%
rates.

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.720 align:middle line:90%
I said, look.

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:46.830 align:middle line:90%
Your kids are good kids.

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:48.201 align:middle line:90%
Don't do this if they're not.

00:49:48.201 --> 00:49:49.200 align:middle line:90%
Your kids are good kids.

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Why not just refinance
them and keep

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:52.740 align:middle line:90%
the interest in the family?

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:55.500 align:middle line:90%
I think that's a wonderful idea.

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.300 align:middle line:90%
One area-- speaking of family--

00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I love is you call
it "Family Wealth."

00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:01.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a book by Jay Hughes.--

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:02.290 align:middle line:90%
And let's talk about that.

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:03.862 align:middle line:84%
How we can help
each other's family.

00:50:03.862 --> 00:50:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Jay Hughes is
a very successful lawyer

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:07.890 align:middle line:84%
who wrote a book about
how wealthy families can

00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:08.730 align:middle line:90%
stay wealthy.

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:14.380 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the
process that he recommends,

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:17.640 align:middle line:84%
it's fabulous for families
who want to get wealthy.

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:19.530 align:middle line:84%
I always end the Solari
Report by saying,

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:21.370 align:middle line:84%
don't ask whether
there is a conspiracy.

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:23.650 align:middle line:84%
If you're not in one,
you need to start one.

00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:25.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's literally
teaching families

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:30.180 align:middle line:84%
how to conspire to help
themselves not just make money,

00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:32.160 align:middle line:84%
but to help each
individual and the family

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.369 align:middle line:84%
be successful and
pursue their dreams.

00:50:34.369 --> 00:50:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
doesn't that really

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:40.350 align:middle line:84%
require an extraordinary
amount of love and altruism?

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Because every family
member is so different.

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.690 align:middle line:84%
An artist might be harder
to justify on paper,

00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:48.510 align:middle line:84%
but what they contribute to
the world offers so much,

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:49.800 align:middle line:90%
has so much value.

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:50.770 align:middle line:90%
How do you work this?

00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, what
Hughes argues--

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:56.940 align:middle line:84%
and I agree totally with him--
is that each person in a family

00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:58.560 align:middle line:84%
brings their dreams
and their skills.

00:50:58.560 --> 00:50:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: And some make money
and some don't, but the family

00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:04.842 align:middle line:84%
is successful when
all are supported.

00:51:04.842 --> 00:51:06.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was
really interesting

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:08.730 align:middle line:84%
because I used to
compete ruthlessly

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:11.270 align:middle line:84%
with a very famous investment
bank in Washington.

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And they would always
nail me because they

00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:17.530 align:middle line:84%
gave so much in terms of to
the art world and the theater.

00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:20.060 align:middle line:90%
And they'd always get you there.

00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was really funny because
it worked very effectively

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:23.510 align:middle line:90%
for them.

00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:26.560 align:middle line:84%
But what Hughes is
saying is, look.

00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:27.820 align:middle line:90%
The world is an ecosystem.

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:29.940 align:middle line:90%
The family is a mini-ecosystem.

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Build your ecosystem to relate
to the world as an ecosystem.

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:36.776 align:middle line:84%
And everybody needs to
do what their passion is.

00:51:36.776 --> 00:51:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: It's interesting.

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:42.960 align:middle line:84%
When I ran Hamilton
Securities in Washington,

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.460 align:middle line:90%
we once did our budget.

00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:45.460 align:middle line:90%
And I said, look.

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:46.260 align:middle line:90%
Do me a favor.

00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:50.070 align:middle line:84%
I want to do a time budget and
make sure this really works.

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:51.096 align:middle line:90%
So we did a time budget.

00:51:51.096 --> 00:51:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And what we
discovered is that we

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:55.704 align:middle line:90%
had allocated 700% of our time.

00:51:55.704 --> 00:51:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And our plan wasn't
going to work.

00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:57.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Unwise.

00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: So I said, OK.

00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's just pretend
that instead of doing

00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:02.610 align:middle line:84%
what you feel we need
you to do and what

00:52:02.610 --> 00:52:06.600 align:middle line:84%
you're obligated to do, you
do next year what you really

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:08.070 align:middle line:90%
want to do.

00:52:08.070 --> 00:52:09.445 align:middle line:90%
We completely reallocated it.

00:52:09.445 --> 00:52:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, we
could get all the work

00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:14.370 align:middle line:84%
done within the time we
really had because everybody

00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:16.811 align:middle line:84%
was working on what was
really in their heart to do.

00:52:16.811 --> 00:52:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
stayed profitable?

00:52:18.310 --> 00:52:19.410 align:middle line:90%
I mean, everything--

00:52:19.410 --> 00:52:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: We stayed profitable
until the Department of Justice

00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:22.580 align:middle line:90%
came down on [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:23.454 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah.

00:52:23.454 --> 00:52:25.480 align:middle line:90%
That's your big back story.

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: But yeah.

00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:29.520 align:middle line:84%
No, the company that year
was very, very profitable.

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.480 align:middle line:90%
And the plan worked.

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:31.522 align:middle line:90%
And we had real teamwork.

00:52:31.522 --> 00:52:32.646 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:52:32.646 --> 00:52:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: But family--
and I would really

00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:36.900 align:middle line:84%
encourage everybody who wants
to work with their family.

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:38.858 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't want to
work with your family,

00:52:38.858 --> 00:52:40.200 align:middle line:90%
create a family.

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm a great believer
that in this environment,

00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:45.626 align:middle line:90%
we're going to have to help.

00:52:45.626 --> 00:52:47.250 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
to help each other.

00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:49.290 --> 00:52:53.250 align:middle line:84%
We are so stuck in
rigid, little cubicles

00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:55.980 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to finance,
and managing your monies,

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:56.790 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:58.050 align:middle line:84%
We really have to
break free of this

00:52:58.050 --> 00:53:00.480 align:middle line:84%
to be able to be open-minded
and -hearted enough to do this.

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.980 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, in
defense of people,

00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:04.270 align:middle line:84%
it's very hard to find
people that you can trust.

00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:06.570 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: And that's
why I encourage

00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:09.870 align:middle line:84%
people to start a circle and
work with others on what you

00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:11.232 align:middle line:90%
can trust them to do.

00:53:11.232 --> 00:53:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can't trust each
other talking about money,

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:16.314 align:middle line:84%
but you can't trust each other
about going and buying food.

00:53:16.314 --> 00:53:17.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm always saying
to people, look.

00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Take turns going down
to the terminal market

00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:24.540 align:middle line:84%
and get big boxes of
organic food and share it.

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:26.910 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's
reducing your expenses,

00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:30.510 align:middle line:84%
or finding ways of generating
revenues, or investing,

00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:33.750 align:middle line:84%
find people that
you enjoy being with

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:36.000 align:middle line:84%
and work with them
on what you can.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.390 align:middle line:84%
I've often done
circles by phone.

00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:43.110 align:middle line:84%
We do circles by phone with
people all over the country.

00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:46.244 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of it is just--

00:53:46.244 --> 00:53:48.660 align:middle line:84%
I have one group where we're
just following our portfolios

00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:50.618 align:middle line:84%
and talking about what
in the world is going on

00:53:50.618 --> 00:53:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and what does it mean
to our portfolios.

00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:54.935 align:middle line:84%
And every time I
get full of myself

00:53:54.935 --> 00:53:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and think I know
what's going on,

00:53:56.310 --> 00:53:59.040 align:middle line:84%
I get on the phone with them and
I'm like, wow, I missed that.

00:53:59.040 --> 00:53:59.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Yeah.

00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:00.680 align:middle line:90%
It's really fun.

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is
that networked economy

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:03.940 align:middle line:90%
of diverse skills?

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:04.740 align:middle line:90%
We need this.

00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:05.550 align:middle line:90%
Not just family.

00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:08.220 align:middle line:84%
We need this in
communities, among friends.

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: We're leaving
the unipolar world.

00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:11.511 align:middle line:84%
We're going to the
multi-polar world.

00:54:11.511 --> 00:54:13.110 align:middle line:90%
It's complicated.

00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:14.140 align:middle line:90%
It's changing.

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:17.890 align:middle line:84%
No one can ever know
really what's going on.

00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why we
have to work together.

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:25.500 align:middle line:84%
It's made more complicated
by fraud, identity theft,

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:26.647 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:54:26.647 --> 00:54:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And you talk a little bit
about how to protect yourself.

00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: The financial
fraud is very, very serious.

00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And you know, for many years,
I've said get the bad guys out

00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:35.760 align:middle line:90%
of your data.

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.320 align:middle line:90%
Get them out of your portfolio.

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:39.760 align:middle line:90%
Don't do business with them.

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And just now, I
think it's finally--

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:44.256 align:middle line:84%
people are finally
beginning to understand, oh,

00:54:44.256 --> 00:54:45.630 align:middle line:84%
if I do business
with these guys,

00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:48.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm much more
susceptible to fraud.

00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:51.960 align:middle line:84%
But you have to take
this very seriously.

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:54.810 align:middle line:84%
We have a great Solari
Report on identity theft.

00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:56.820 align:middle line:84%
There are many
things you can do.

00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:58.260 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
take it seriously.

00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And part of it is by simply
just watching your finances.

00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:04.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and as she
told me off-camera also,

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:08.490 align:middle line:84%
keep all your records separate
from the grid and the system.

00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:09.890 align:middle line:90%
You use USB sticks.

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:12.510 align:middle line:84%
You can do hard copy,
whatever you need to do.

00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:15.780 align:middle line:84%
But make sure you have
records of what you're doing.

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: You need to
have very good archiving

00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:22.860 align:middle line:84%
of your financial records
and documentation.

00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:25.590 align:middle line:84%
If you look at any of the
disasters we've experienced

00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:28.650 align:middle line:84%
in this country from
Katrina to power outages,

00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:30.324 align:middle line:84%
the people who could
come back up fast

00:55:30.324 --> 00:55:31.990 align:middle line:84%
were the people who
had their documents.

00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:37.110 align:middle line:84%
If you had all your
documentation coming out

00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:39.420 align:middle line:84%
of Katrina, you got your
insurance money very fast.

00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:42.344 align:middle line:90%
If you didn't, it was a problem.

00:55:42.344 --> 00:55:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're responsible
for that part of our lives.

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And go to Solari to
find out what they can

00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:48.840 align:middle line:90%
do in terms of identity fraud.

00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
identity theft.

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:53.820 align:middle line:90%
Another one is contribution.

00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:55.172 align:middle line:90%
I know you like crowdfunding.

00:55:55.172 --> 00:55:56.130 align:middle line:90%
You like to contribute.

00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:57.671 align:middle line:84%
You have your little
pet causes where

00:55:57.671 --> 00:56:00.780 align:middle line:84%
you'll spend $100 a
month here and maybe $100

00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:03.390 align:middle line:84%
a month here to help
build a community

00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:05.802 align:middle line:84%
or help build a new
standard of living.

00:56:05.802 --> 00:56:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: It was
really interesting.

00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:08.700 align:middle line:84%
During the
litigation, two things

00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:11.170 align:middle line:84%
happened to me that really
profoundly changed my life.

00:56:11.170 --> 00:56:14.190 align:middle line:84%
One was all my life, I
had wanted to make money.

00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:16.020 align:middle line:90%
And I'd been very successful.

00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:18.217 align:middle line:84%
And whenever anybody in
my close friends or family

00:56:18.217 --> 00:56:20.550 align:middle line:84%
got in trouble and needed
help, I would loan them money.

00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:22.170 align:middle line:90%
I would give them money.

00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And when the litigation hit,
I realized that I had given

00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:28.920 align:middle line:90%
or lent $250,000.

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And the Department
of Justice was--

00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:34.180 align:middle line:84%
a process had begun where
all of my credit and access

00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:34.980 align:middle line:90%
to income--

00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You needed
your money back.

00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Well, my
family got together

00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:40.170 align:middle line:84%
and they said, well, I
guess she needs it back.

00:56:40.170 --> 00:56:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And that money, Regina,
trickled in over 11 years

00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:43.710 align:middle line:90%
and saved my life.

00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:45.210 align:middle line:90%
Without it, I wouldn't--

00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:48.720 align:middle line:84%
I had put it in the
bank, if you will.

00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And it was the one source of
money that couldn't be cut off.

00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:54.360 align:middle line:90%
It was--

00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Family and friends
who you had done for.

00:56:56.610 --> 00:56:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Right.

00:56:57.410 --> 00:56:58.530 align:middle line:90%
So it came back.

00:56:58.530 --> 00:57:00.162 align:middle line:90%
And it literally saved my life.

00:57:00.162 --> 00:57:01.620 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
that used to happen

00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:03.450 align:middle line:84%
was one of the
things I discovered

00:57:03.450 --> 00:57:08.890 align:middle line:84%
was that I would be in
church and some old church

00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:11.040 align:middle line:84%
mother would come up and
put a quarter in my hand

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:13.340 align:middle line:84%
and say, honey, I'm
praying for you.

00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And that little
bit of money was--

00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:17.310 align:middle line:90%
it was like a prayer.

00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:19.620 align:middle line:84%
And there was some
material real to it

00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:21.940 align:middle line:84%
just because that
quarter was real to her.

00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:23.710 align:middle line:90%
That dollar was real to her.

00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And I started to discover
the power of tiny dollars

00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:29.020 align:middle line:84%
to really change the
energy in a situation.

00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:30.700 align:middle line:90%
It's like a vote.

00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And so if you come to Solari
every week or so, we're doing--

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:36.540 align:middle line:90%
it's little donations.

00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:39.370 align:middle line:84%
But we're saying, we think
this person is great.

00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:40.860 align:middle line:90%
We're trying to support them.

00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think that can make
an enormous difference.

00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:44.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm a tither.

00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:45.660 align:middle line:90%
I believe in tithing.

00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And don't worry that
it's not a lot of money,

00:57:50.610 --> 00:57:51.840 align:middle line:90%
because it's a prayer.

00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And energetically, it can
make a huge difference.

00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:57.300 align:middle line:84%
If you see something
you love, just send it--

00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:59.100 align:middle line:90%
if you have $1, send a $1.

00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:00.220 align:middle line:90%
It makes a big difference.

00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:01.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, another area
is really going into our heart.

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Some people feel-- and some
people genuinely don't even

00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:08.894 align:middle line:90%
have an extra dollar to share.

00:58:08.894 --> 00:58:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Or, not very many
dollars at all because

00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:13.830 align:middle line:84%
they're living on a
subsistence kind of income.

00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:14.905 align:middle line:90%
Social Security.

00:58:14.905 --> 00:58:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: But they
could say a prayer.

00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to say.

00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:19.330 align:middle line:84%
But we can give of ourselves
on other levels of our heart

00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:20.130 align:middle line:90%
and mind.

00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And Unitarian Church is
kind of a great example

00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:24.310 align:middle line:90%
with their prayer circles.

00:58:24.310 --> 00:58:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: One of the
things I discovered was,

00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:29.430 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a book for--
first, for the clients,

00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:31.830 align:middle line:84%
and then we put it up, called
"Gifting to the Children

00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:32.940 align:middle line:90%
We Love."

00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:34.560 align:middle line:84%
I would talk to
people in a family.

00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And some people would say,
well, we don't have any time.

00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:39.886 align:middle line:84%
And other people would say,
well, we don't have any money.

00:58:39.886 --> 00:58:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And I realized,
well, wait a minute.

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:42.820 align:middle line:90%
You have time.

00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:43.620 align:middle line:90%
You have money.

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Get together and organize a
plan where you put in the money

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:49.650 align:middle line:84%
and you put in the time
and you help these kids.

00:58:49.650 --> 00:58:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:51.270 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: And it works.

00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:53.192 align:middle line:84%
But you have to talk
about your money.

00:58:53.192 --> 00:58:55.400 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a world where
we were very comfortable--

00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't
talk about it though.

00:58:56.650 --> 00:58:58.620 align:middle line:84%
In most families, you
don't talk about it.

00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:00.966 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: We have to
start talking about this.

00:59:00.966 --> 00:59:01.766 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:59:01.766 --> 00:59:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Because if you
look, for 500 years,

00:59:05.610 --> 00:59:08.280 align:middle line:84%
we've been in the central
banking warfare model.

00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we're going
to globalize--

00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:12.690 align:middle line:84%
the way the central banking
warfare model worked

00:59:12.690 --> 00:59:14.280 align:middle line:84%
is we had a covenant
with each other,

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:18.180 align:middle line:84%
but we financed our covenant by
stealing from everybody else.

00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:20.070 align:middle line:84%
So now if we're
going to globalize,

00:59:20.070 --> 00:59:22.650 align:middle line:84%
it's going to have to
be do unto others as you

00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:24.390 align:middle line:90%
would have them do unto you.

00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:26.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's also going
to be finance unto

00:59:26.310 --> 00:59:28.275 align:middle line:84%
others as you would have
them finance unto you.

00:59:28.275 --> 00:59:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:31.066 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: We're going to
have to get the money.

00:59:31.066 --> 00:59:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And as we look at this choice
between inhuman and human,

00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:37.110 align:middle line:84%
the humans, if they
want a win, have

00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:40.690 align:middle line:84%
no other choice but to get
into the money and say, OK,

00:59:40.690 --> 00:59:43.920 align:middle line:84%
how can we re-engineer the
money so our team wins?

00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:46.616 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, we get to
finance heaven on earth.

00:59:46.616 --> 00:59:47.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:59:47.490 --> 00:59:49.390 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't agree more with you.

00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:50.190 align:middle line:90%
Any final thoughts?

00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:51.900 align:middle line:90%
That was so beautiful.

00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:53.570 align:middle line:84%
Final thought before
we sign-off here?

00:59:53.570 --> 00:59:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: Yeah.

00:59:54.370 --> 00:59:57.460 align:middle line:10%
The one thing I
would say is, I think

00:59:57.460 --> 01:00:00.430 align:middle line:10%
the number one goal of
the entrainment machine

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:02.230 align:middle line:10%
is to persuade you
that it's hopeless.

01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:03.030 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:05.580 align:middle line:10%
>>FITTS: We have far
more power and we're

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:08.410 align:middle line:10%
far closer to turning this
around than anybody knows.

01:00:08.410 --> 01:00:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Couldn't agree more.

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.550 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: And so I
have a concept called

01:00:11.550 --> 01:00:14.220 align:middle line:84%
turtle, where one of
the things I learned

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:16.350 align:middle line:84%
in dealing up against
the entrainment machine

01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:18.180 align:middle line:90%
is never quit.

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:21.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if it
looks hopeless, you

01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:22.404 align:middle line:90%
can always clean your closets.

01:00:22.404 --> 01:00:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And then the next morning,
if your closets are tidy,

01:00:24.570 --> 01:00:26.640 align:middle line:84%
you'll feel better
and you'll keep going.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.181 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you'll
have the energy.

01:00:28.181 --> 01:00:29.700 align:middle line:90%
>>FITTS: And so don't buy it.

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.380 align:middle line:90%
Don't buy into the hopelessness.

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:32.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not true.

01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:35.340 align:middle line:84%
We have the power
to turn this around.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.970 align:middle line:84%
It's been an absolute joy
being with you once again.

01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:41.040 align:middle line:84%
It's always like
such a fast ride.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.330 align:middle line:90%
I just love it.

01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:44.217 align:middle line:84%
And so we'll do this
again down the road.

01:00:44.217 --> 01:00:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much
for your perspectives,

01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:47.925 align:middle line:84%
and for giving people
that kind of hope back.

01:00:47.925 --> 01:00:50.622 align:middle line:84%
>>FITTS: Thank you for
everything you do, Regina.

01:00:50.622 --> 01:00:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I hope
this has given you

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.170 align:middle line:84%
a new sense of the possibilities
that are under your own control

01:00:55.170 --> 01:00:56.190 align:middle line:90%
to implement.

01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:58.510 align:middle line:90%
Change by choice is powerful.

01:00:58.510 --> 01:01:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you
for joining us here on Gaia.
