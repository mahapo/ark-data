It's our good fortune to have
Barbara Hand Clow back with us.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.200 align:middle line:84%
In today's conversation, we're
going to take a step back

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.230 align:middle line:84%
and glimpse into the
foundational cosmic influences

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.170 align:middle line:84%
that have created the
polarization and intransigence

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.330 align:middle line:90%
of today's mass mindset.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.570 align:middle line:84%
How many of us have actually
said, are we going crazy?

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Barbara has some
answers to that and why.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.672 align:middle line:84%
Barbara, it's so good
to see you again.

00:00:42.672 --> 00:00:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BARBARA HAND CLOW: It's
wonderful to be back.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've had so
many good conversations.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.450 align:middle line:84%
We just did a little
Facebook Live thing together,

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.640 align:middle line:84%
so some of you may
have seen that.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: That was
kind of fun, yeah.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
kind of going over

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.908 align:middle line:84%
some of our favorite
interviews together.

00:00:52.908 --> 00:00:56.505 align:middle line:84%
And we both agreed we loved "The
Alchemy of Nine Dimensions,"

00:00:56.505 --> 00:00:58.130 align:middle line:84%
which we shot in your
personal library.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.110 align:middle line:84%
So for whoever
has not seen that,

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.550 align:middle line:90%
go back and take a look at it.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.703 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, today, we're
going to be focusing

00:01:03.703 --> 00:01:05.120 align:middle line:84%
on the work of
another book called

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.680 align:middle line:84%
"Awakening of the Planetary
Mind," written in 2011.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.210 align:middle line:84%
We chose to go back
to that for a reason.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And first, explain to us why
that body of work at that time

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.590 align:middle line:84%
has such a pronounced
message for this time.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.390 align:middle line:10%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.530 align:middle line:10%
Actually, it came out in
2001 as "Catastrophobia"--

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.530 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And rewritten.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.725 align:middle line:10%
>>CLOW: --which means
fear of catastrophe.

00:01:24.725 --> 00:01:27.140 align:middle line:10%
The reason I bring this
up is because, of course,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.840 align:middle line:10%
the book was issued
in September 11, 2001.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And so the book
initially flopped.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.740 align:middle line:84%
But then, about six
months after people

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.370 align:middle line:84%
got over the cataclysm of
that moment in time, then

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.240 align:middle line:90%
the book did well.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And then I revised it in
to 2011 because so much

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.370 align:middle line:84%
has happened in archaeology
and advanced studies

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.180 align:middle line:90%
since the initial--

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So many
discoveries over that decade.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.865 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's right.

00:01:52.865 --> 00:01:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And even intervening
evidence since then, from 2011

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.200 align:middle line:90%
to now.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: What it enabled me to
do is, in the 2001 edition,

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.920 align:middle line:84%
I had to say "if
it is true, then."

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I
got to 2011, most

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.360 align:middle line:84%
of the things that I had
discussed had been proven.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And so it covers the last 20,000
years of human consciousness--

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.510 align:middle line:90%
even the last 100,000 years.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And it focuses on a
series of cataclysms

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and of disasters that have
affected our consciousness,

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.490 align:middle line:90%
affected our hearts.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think it's
very important that people

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.460 align:middle line:84%
are aware and keep in mind that
we are a traumatized species.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And this doesn't matter where
in the world you're from.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.700 align:middle line:84%
These cataclysmic
events have affected

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.850 align:middle line:84%
all regions of the world,
all civilizations, all

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.290 align:middle line:90%
people of the world.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.240 align:middle line:90%
We are traumatized species.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not
just the epigenetics

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.520 align:middle line:90%
of 10 or 15 generations.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.220 align:middle line:84%
In our cells, we
fear for our lives

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.010 align:middle line:84%
when we feel certain
influences happening.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a good
jumping-off place to go into it.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Because first of all,
what you're saying

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.530 align:middle line:84%
is the great deluge was the
last really big mass trauma,

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.330 align:middle line:90%
global trauma.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Yeah, the cataclysm
about 11,500 years ago

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.810 align:middle line:84%
was not only the last
and most recent one

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.040 align:middle line:84%
but also, it was the most
profound one, probably,

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.090 align:middle line:90%
in the history of Earth.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Because the Earth
was almost destroyed.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not just an issue
of the Earth itself.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.400 align:middle line:84%
It's an issue of
the solar system.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And so now, we're at
the opposite point

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.290 align:middle line:84%
to that moment in
time, and we're

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.027 align:middle line:84%
having a resurgence of
ancient memory related

00:03:30.027 --> 00:03:30.860 align:middle line:90%
to these cataclysms.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you say we're
at the opposite point, what

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.830 align:middle line:84%
do you mean, like halfway
through the precession?

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.205 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: That means
the precession

00:03:35.205 --> 00:03:38.360 align:middle line:84%
of the equinoxes, yeah, the
26,000 year precessional cycle,

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.380 align:middle line:84%
which is the main influence on
the change in human cultures

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.235 align:middle line:90%
on our planet.

00:03:43.235 --> 00:03:45.110 align:middle line:84%
So now that we've come
to the opposite point,

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.090 align:middle line:84%
it's like the full
moon, where we're

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.520 align:middle line:84%
having an explosion of inner
consciousness of these events.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.740 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know
what's causing it.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Most people are just feeling
tremendous inner turmoil.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And they think it's
outside politics.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, outside politics
have a huge affect on us,

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.990 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they're
a reflection of it.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a reflection of it.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.960 align:middle line:84%
So everybody in
the political arena

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.200 align:middle line:84%
is being affected by this
level of catastrophobia,

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.370 align:middle line:90%
as well as us, as individuals.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And so, in my case,
I'm part Cherokee

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.390 align:middle line:84%
and have had an indigenous
training as a child.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was taught that
unless we recover our story,

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.720 align:middle line:90%
we will not survive--

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.610 align:middle line:90%
the actual story of our species.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.052 align:middle line:84%
And this is a really
interesting issue at this point.

00:04:31.052 --> 00:04:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to bring up
something for just a moment

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.342 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't stress
in "Awakening,"

00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:36.175 align:middle line:90%
or "Catastrophobia."

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Please.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Because I felt
that it was too scary

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.570 align:middle line:90%
and was an unwise idea.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.200 align:middle line:84%
But at this point, this
particular issue is now,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:84%
basically, something
that's understood

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.340 align:middle line:84%
by people, which is
we are in the middle

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.050 align:middle line:90%
of a mass extinction.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And we've had a series of
mass extinctions over millions

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.460 align:middle line:90%
and millions of years.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And with each mass
extinction, what happened

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.700 align:middle line:84%
was a whole new level
of evolution started.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And so we're in the middle
of a mass extinction

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.557 align:middle line:84%
right now, which was
too scary to talk about.

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:09.140 align:middle line:84%
But at this point,
everybody knows it.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And so now we can bring
that into the dialogue.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.750 align:middle line:84%
The reason it's important
is a mass extinction

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.560 align:middle line:84%
is always a clearing away of
old issues and old species.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.630 align:middle line:90%
And a new species comes in.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the new species
will be enlightened humans.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.110 align:middle line:84%
I do not think we
will survive if we

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.590 align:middle line:84%
don't raise our consciousness
and remember our story.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's the whole
point of "Awakening."

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.340 align:middle line:84%
One thing your book talks about
is how it was so devastating,

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:84%
this last event, roughly
11,500, 11,600 years ago

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.840 align:middle line:84%
that it actually knocked
the Earth off its axis.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.653 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
bring that up is

00:05:47.653 --> 00:05:49.320 align:middle line:84%
because, somewhere
in our consciousness,

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:56.040 align:middle line:84%
also, were times that people
see as idyllic, as Eden,

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.720 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, as a type of
Eden, where there was plenty.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.720 align:middle line:84%
We all have this, at
least in our imagination,

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.750 align:middle line:84%
of this realm where
food was plenty,

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.330 align:middle line:84%
the weather was perfect,
the Earth was verdant.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.630 align:middle line:84%
And we all have this idealized
image of Earth and life

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.060 align:middle line:90%
in our mind somewhere.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Did that come from a
time before the Earth

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.640 align:middle line:90%
was knocked off its axis?

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: I think so and one
of the things that I cover

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.100 align:middle line:84%
in the book is the question
of whether perception actually

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.860 align:middle line:84%
started 11,000 or
12,000 years ago.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.300 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not sure about that.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.990 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that if you go
back to 15,000, 16,000, 17,000,

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:43.890 align:middle line:84%
18,000 years ago, we do have
an idyllic Eden on this planet.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually coming
from other issues that are not

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.480 align:middle line:90%
covered in "Catastrophobia."

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.510 align:middle line:84%
This is actually
coming from some cycles

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.360 align:middle line:84%
that Andrew Collins
talks about, which

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.450 align:middle line:84%
is the issue of the Altai
civilization in Mongolia

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.450 align:middle line:84%
and a very high level
of consciousness

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.810 align:middle line:84%
on this planet about
17,000 years ago.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.600 align:middle line:84%
So since that
whole idea came up,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.340 align:middle line:84%
since I wrote the two books, I'm
exploring that in my trilogy.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.430 align:middle line:84%
Because it's such an
interesting, fascinating idea

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.570 align:middle line:90%
of what is Eden?

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:90%
What were we like?

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.780 align:middle line:90%
What were we in touch with?

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And the only way I could
do that was in fiction.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.110 align:middle line:84%
So my characters are
exploring the issue of Eden

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.320 align:middle line:90%
in the Revelations trilogy.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.750 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.230 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.500 align:middle line:90%
And so because it's within us.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.560 align:middle line:84%
We have that
remembrance, just as we

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.075 align:middle line:84%
have this cellular, unconscious
fear of cataclysmic events--

00:07:42.075 --> 00:07:42.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's right.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:44.987 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --whether
it's tsunamis,

00:07:44.987 --> 00:07:46.980 align:middle line:90%
whether it's a blackening sky.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And fortunately, I
have a little piece of access

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.230 align:middle line:84%
to that, which is
nine-dimensional consciousness.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Because with nine-dimensional
consciousness,

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:59.470 align:middle line:84%
the heart is in the middle,
the fifth dimension.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And so throughout the
ages, since the cataclysms,

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.920 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
last 12,000 years,

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:84%
there have always been
enlightened teachers

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.170 align:middle line:84%
on the planet who were
in touch with nine

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.070 align:middle line:90%
dimensions of consciousness.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And so in my case,
I wrote a book

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.220 align:middle line:84%
about that called "Alchemy
of Nine Dimensions,"

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.930 align:middle line:90%
based on the Pleaidian agenda.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:23.130 align:middle line:84%
But we do have the ability
to get in touch with Eden

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.890 align:middle line:84%
and get in touch with these
levels of consciousness.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And we do have the ability to
go beyond that moment of fear

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.900 align:middle line:90%
and that moment of trauma.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And so where we are
right now is we're

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.240 align:middle line:84%
stuck in our world,
the third dimension,

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.860 align:middle line:84%
dealing with incredible fourth
dimensional polarization trauma

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.660 align:middle line:90%
as these memories come forth.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.600 align:middle line:84%
But we must never forget
that we also have the ability

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.030 align:middle line:84%
to go up to the fifth dimension
or the sixth dimension,

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.840 align:middle line:90%
the level of the soul.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.160 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability to go to
higher dimensions right now.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And the Pleaidians
said, back in 1995,

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.380 align:middle line:84%
that nine dimensions
of consciousness

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.550 align:middle line:84%
would open within the human at
the end of the Mayan calendar.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.570 align:middle line:90%
And it actually has happened.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.930 align:middle line:84%
But because of it,
we're just flooded

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.900 align:middle line:84%
with all these multi-layers
of consciousness.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And we don't know
what's going on.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:15.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And the hard thing about
writing "The Pleaidian

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Agenda" and "The Alchemy
of Nine Dimensions" is you

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.220 align:middle line:84%
don't need anything
beyond the heart.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:27.540 align:middle line:84%
But what goes on in these higher
levels is utterly fascinating.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.550 align:middle line:84%
So we are a strange species
where, on the one hand,

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.570 align:middle line:84%
what we really need to
do is be in the heart.

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.780 align:middle line:84%
But because we have human
intellectual consciousness,

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.310 align:middle line:84%
we're fascinated by
these higher levels.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:41.310 align:middle line:84%
So my fascination kept
me going, but I could

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.810 align:middle line:90%
have just stayed in the heart.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.060 align:middle line:90%
And so could you.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:44.890 align:middle line:90%
And so could Zeus.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:46.220 align:middle line:90%
He could, too.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:46.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: (LAUGHING) Yeah, right.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He absolutely could.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I interviewed someone
yesterday, Joan Walker,

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.080 align:middle line:90%
and she did a live channeling.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And they were saying there
is a new influence coming in.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a new form of
light coming in now

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.630 align:middle line:84%
if you can take advantage
and incorporate this and feel

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.330 align:middle line:84%
it, understand it,
and work with it.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And there is this thing,
this impulse or frequency,

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:07.770 align:middle line:90%
that is called love.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's not what
you think of as love.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.370 align:middle line:84%
It is this sustaining
form of light.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
the quality of how that

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.890 align:middle line:90%
feels inside the being in body.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.030 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing sentimental.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.680 align:middle line:90%
You can't objectify it.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.545 align:middle line:90%
It's like embodying light.

00:10:23.545 --> 00:10:26.573 align:middle line:90%


00:10:26.573 --> 00:10:28.240 align:middle line:84%
There's no way to
describe how it feels.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, and see,
for me, that would

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:84%
be the seventh
dimension coming in.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:32.787 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
why I was asking.

00:10:32.787 --> 00:10:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Yeah And we
really need to start

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.410 align:middle line:84%
integrating these levels, which
is exactly what we're doing.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Because as soon as
you start integrating

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.750 align:middle line:84%
the light levels of the seventh
dimension-- and what they do

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.660 align:middle line:84%
is they quicken your body
and they quicken your mind

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.570 align:middle line:84%
and, most importantly,
they deepen your hope.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And then, as you struggle with
the issue of why am I here,

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.850 align:middle line:84%
which is really a
sixth-dimensional issue

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.190 align:middle line:84%
of the soul, you're
already above

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.900 align:middle line:90%
that fourth-dimensional zone.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And the
fourth-dimensional zone is

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.590 align:middle line:84%
what's giving us all
the trouble because

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.960 align:middle line:84%
of the issue of reptilian
interference and control.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's just kind of dive into
it because that's where we are,

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.520 align:middle line:90%
all right?

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.170 align:middle line:84%
So when we had our discussions,
the two conversations,

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:16.850 align:middle line:84%
"Alchemy of Nine Dimensions,"
the oddest thing happened.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.090 align:middle line:90%
We forgot to talk about--

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:20.620 align:middle line:90%
I forgot to even--

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.820 align:middle line:84%
I think it was in
the script, even--

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.340 align:middle line:90%
and this doesn't ever happen.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Between the two of us, we
simply dropped the ball

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.960 align:middle line:84%
on the fourth dimension,
which is the one causing

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.860 align:middle line:90%
all the problems.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.750 align:middle line:84%
So you came back
at another time,

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.450 align:middle line:84%
and we focused on the
fourth dimension a bit more.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
how weird is that,

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.140 align:middle line:84%
that we would drop the
fourth, the middle,

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.320 align:middle line:84%
dimension in all of this
out of the conversation.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:46.660 align:middle line:84%
But as you say, this is
one that is overseen by,

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.600 align:middle line:90%
you said the Anunnaki.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.210 align:middle line:84%
It's the one in
"Catastrophobia,"

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.310 align:middle line:84%
in "Awakening the
Planetary Mind."

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.600 align:middle line:84%
This is the one that creates
the notions of conspiracy,

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.540 align:middle line:84%
deep state, matrix, new
world order, end times.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:06.880 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the fourth
dimension and its expression

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.960 align:middle line:84%
at this time of
those things people

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.260 align:middle line:84%
have bought into
to such an extent,

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.337 align:middle line:84%
it's creating hatred
between people.

00:12:13.337 --> 00:12:14.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yes, I know.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I guess the
best thing I could do now

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.510 align:middle line:84%
is offer what I've
been experiencing.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And what I've been
experiencing is

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.380 align:middle line:84%
we're in the middle
of such a heavy duty,

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:27.190 align:middle line:84%
intense, fourth-dimensional
influence that that has caused

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:30.160 align:middle line:84%
me to recognize more
and more and more

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.080 align:middle line:90%
where it's really coming from.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm moving more
in the direction

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.880 align:middle line:84%
all the time of
reptilian influence.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't really
discussed that

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.480 align:middle line:84%
very much because,
first of all, David Icke

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.120 align:middle line:84%
did a great job on it and
all that kind of stuff.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.780 align:middle line:84%
But I'm finding that the
Anunnaki issue is just

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.930 align:middle line:84%
kind of a subset of all of
that and that we're really

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:53.770 align:middle line:84%
starting to see that we are
being heavily influenced

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:55.558 align:middle line:90%
by this reptilian influence.

00:12:55.558 --> 00:12:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Barbara, just let
me interject one thing here

00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.760 align:middle line:84%
because I want you to
explain this in detail.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Sure.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm in contact with
all these different people--

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:06.850 align:middle line:84%
all these people that
channel, my own beings

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:09.820 align:middle line:90%
that inform me and guide me--

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:13.333 align:middle line:84%
and in each case, they
will not talk about that.

00:13:13.333 --> 00:13:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Mm-hmm, interesting.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And even
my own beings,

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:16.990 align:middle line:90%
when I've asked about that--

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.960 align:middle line:84%
I said, tell me about this
realm and these beings.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And they always, they
just say, there's

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.100 align:middle line:90%
no need to discuss this.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.670 align:middle line:90%
And they won't talk about it.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.490 align:middle line:84%
So I ask other
people who channel,

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:29.320 align:middle line:84%
and they basically
skirt around it,

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.060 align:middle line:90%
and they won't talk about it.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.460 align:middle line:84%
So we're left here without
any kind of guidebook

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.470 align:middle line:84%
to these influences
that every one of us

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:38.350 align:middle line:84%
can feel coming through
our institutions,

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.660 align:middle line:84%
coming through our media,
our political systems,

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.160 align:middle line:90%
our pharmaceutical industries--

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:43.960 align:middle line:90%
all of it.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:50.327 align:middle line:84%
We feel the influence
inculcated into all of it now.

00:13:50.327 --> 00:13:51.160 align:middle line:90%
Please explain this.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, I'm glad you gave
that little listing of where

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:54.940 align:middle line:90%
the influence is coming through.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Because I think, at
this point, we all

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:01.180 align:middle line:84%
have had enough experience with
what the deep state is doing

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.460 align:middle line:84%
or what the
pharmaceuticals are doing

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.860 align:middle line:84%
or what the war machine
is doing or whatever

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.880 align:middle line:84%
so that we really recognize at
this point that it is a force.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And so this is coming
through as a force.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose one of the
reasons that I'm really

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.150 align:middle line:84%
comfortable talking about it is
I'm, actually, very galactic.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And having an extremely
galactic mindset,

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.930 align:middle line:84%
I believe that everyone in
the universe plays a role.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe that the
reptilians are playing a role.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So OK.

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me ask you, the
reptilians, the cosmology

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:35.150 align:middle line:90%
of what's happening right now--

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:38.710 align:middle line:84%
so where we are in our own solar
system, so how the astrology's

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.420 align:middle line:90%
playing out on Earth--

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.500 align:middle line:84%
tell me the role and the
purpose and the opportunity

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.460 align:middle line:84%
in these beings
influencing us in this way.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: These
beings are the cause

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.380 align:middle line:84%
of fourth-dimensional
polarization, the split

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.870 align:middle line:90%
of reality into dark and light.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.910 align:middle line:90%
And we are electromagnetic.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.520 align:middle line:90%
We are polarized beings.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And so these beings
are influencing us,

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:07.790 align:middle line:84%
but they're basically
physical in this dimension.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.740 align:middle line:84%
There's issues with
them living underground,

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.032 align:middle line:90%
which I think is probably true.

00:15:11.032 --> 00:15:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's issues of them
being in a non-physical

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:14.940 align:middle line:90%
fourth-dimensional space.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.930 align:middle line:90%
So I think all of that's true.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:20.810 align:middle line:84%
But what they do for
us is they polarize us.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And that is just
part of being alive

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:26.450 align:middle line:84%
and part of being an
electromagnetic being.

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:30.770 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, they
have way, way, way too high

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.780 align:middle line:84%
of an opinion of how
much influence they

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.040 align:middle line:90%
should be having.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Looking at it from a
galactic point of view,

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.530 align:middle line:84%
they have way
overreached the domain

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.410 align:middle line:84%
that they have a right
to be involved in.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you get into galactic
politics and stuff like that,

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.680 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that the reptilians
are included because everyone

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.050 align:middle line:90%
is included in the discussion.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they don't
honor, quote, "the--

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Yeah, they're not
honoring boundaries and stuff

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.160 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And they're interfering
in ways that are not

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.760 align:middle line:84%
allowed in the third
dimension-- the ends justify

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.170 align:middle line:84%
the means and all
that sort of stuff.

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And so the ends don't
justify the means, period.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And that's
something that we're living

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:10.190 align:middle line:90%
out day by day right now.

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:12.290 align:middle line:90%
That's third-dimensional law.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And so the reptilians
have overridden it.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:84%
But in my experience
with them, we've

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:23.730 align:middle line:84%
come to the point where it's
time for them to let go.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.030 align:middle line:84%
I need to ask you
a question there.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.530 align:middle line:90%
They're not playing fairly.

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.870 align:middle line:84%
They're not playing
by, as you say,

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.125 align:middle line:84%
cosmic rule, which is you don't
interfere like that, period.

00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: You're right.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:34.280 align:middle line:90%
Right

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
they're interfering.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:39.643 align:middle line:84%
All the other beings
within our galactic society

00:16:39.643 --> 00:16:41.810 align:middle line:84%
are fully aware of what
they're doing here on Earth.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yes.

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
playing from the shadows.

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:46.790 align:middle line:84%
It's a manipulative,
unfair game.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yep-- mind control.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mind control
coming from the shadow,

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.500 align:middle line:90%
so you can't see it.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's right.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I'm not down
with looking for saviors.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:03.750 align:middle line:84%
But at what point can
these beings be reined in?

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:08.119 align:middle line:84%
Or what can we do to,
essentially, hold them,

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:09.890 align:middle line:90%
push them out?

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:12.349 align:middle line:84%
How do we get around
this horrible trap

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:13.940 align:middle line:90%
that we've found ourselves in?

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, to
understand that,

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.349 align:middle line:84%
we have to go back
2,000 years, and we

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:20.540 align:middle line:90%
have to go back to the Archons.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Because what happened
2,000 years ago--

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.609 align:middle line:84%
and this is probably
the most critical thing

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:29.000 align:middle line:84%
that I could ever
explain or create with.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And my whole trilogy
is being created based

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.390 align:middle line:90%
on the following concept--

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:37.700 align:middle line:84%
that 2,000 years
ago, the Gnostics,

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.700 align:middle line:84%
who were early followers
of Christ and Jesus,

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.010 align:middle line:90%
and not only early followers.

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:47.180 align:middle line:84%
There was a whole pile of
spiritual groups at that point

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.010 align:middle line:90%
that were flowering.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The Essenes?

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.190 align:middle line:84%
We were moving out
of the Age of Aries

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:55.160 align:middle line:90%
into Pisces around 100 BC.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.800 align:middle line:84%
So the Gnostics
specialized in the Archons.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
happened to the Gnostics

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.100 align:middle line:84%
is I think that they
just had Archons

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.120 align:middle line:90%
appearing all over the place.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.390 align:middle line:84%
I think that they would
try to sit down and read

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:84%
a book at night, and oh,
no, there's another one.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:15.410 align:middle line:84%
Because the Archons were really
trying to penetrate our reality

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.330 align:middle line:84%
and take over our
reality at that point.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And so the Gnostics
taught, the basic teaching,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000 align:middle line:84%
is that the new Christian
religion, the religion that

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.410 align:middle line:84%
worked with Jesus, should
let go of the age of Aries

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and let go of the issue
of Hebrew teachings.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.690 align:middle line:84%
It's not that the Hebrew
teachings were to go away.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:40.100 align:middle line:84%
It's just that Christianity
was a new religion and needed

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:44.690 align:middle line:84%
to be founded on the
teachings of Jesus.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's a time for
everything in our development

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:47.900 align:middle line:90%
as a species.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yes.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:49.030 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And so that is my really
big message right now.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Because now we're
going into Aquarius.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Now we're at the same point
that we were at 2,000 years ago,

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:03.090 align:middle line:84%
where we need to let go of
the parts of the Age of Pisces

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:05.120 align:middle line:84%
that are not going
to function for us.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And more critically
important, we

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:10.730 align:middle line:84%
need to choose high
levels of Aquarius

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:12.253 align:middle line:90%
versus low levels of Aquarius.

00:19:12.253 --> 00:19:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: First
of all, let's talk

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:16.373 align:middle line:84%
about high and low
levels of Pisces,

00:19:16.373 --> 00:19:17.540 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll go into that.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So if we go back to
the age of Pisces,

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:22.948 align:middle line:84%
the Christian teaching
that Jesus brought through,

00:19:22.948 --> 00:19:24.740 align:middle line:84%
and other teachers--
he's not the only one,

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.740 align:middle line:84%
other teachers were
bringing this through, too--

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.390 align:middle line:84%
but the key teaching that
he was bringing through

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:32.360 align:middle line:84%
was we should let go of
the control of the Archons

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.190 align:middle line:90%
and move into the heart.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And what he was
really saying was,

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.990 align:middle line:84%
let's move out of the
fourth-dimensional control

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.540 align:middle line:84%
into the
fifth-dimensional heart.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And if we could
do that, we would

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.910 align:middle line:84%
have an age of love and
compassion for 2,000 years

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:47.930 align:middle line:90%
up to now.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And we'd be in a very
different place, wouldn't we?

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:52.975 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And we could
have done that.

00:19:52.975 --> 00:19:55.100 align:middle line:84%
That's something that's
always important to realize

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.210 align:middle line:90%
as you go into the past.

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.550 align:middle line:84%
You can't change the past,
but we could have done that.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.795 align:middle line:84%
And so what kind of lesson are
we getting from that transition

00:20:02.795 --> 00:20:04.980 align:middle line:90%
point 2,000 years ago?

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what I'm
working on in the trilogy.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:09.380 align:middle line:84%
My characters are
all struggling with,

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:13.310 align:middle line:84%
what is the really important
meaning of Aquarius,

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.260 align:middle line:84%
and how can we
develop and choose

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.550 align:middle line:90%
higher levels of Aquarius?

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.733 align:middle line:84%
And how can we release
negative Piscean?

00:20:19.733 --> 00:20:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So talk
about the traits

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.970 align:middle line:84%
of the higher and low
levels of Aquarius.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.510 align:middle line:90%
This is where it's really tough.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:28.590 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm slugging my
way right through that

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:30.190 align:middle line:90%
at the present moment.

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:33.400 align:middle line:84%
But I'm using, maybe,
five, six, seven--

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even
classical understandings

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.480 align:middle line:90%
of high and low Aquarian traits.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.080 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Aquarius is ruled by
the planet Uranus.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And the planet Uranus
rules transformation

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and radical levels of change
and deep levels of new creation.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:51.150 align:middle line:84%
It's letting go of the old
and bringing in the new.

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And so when we move out
of Pisces into Aquarius,

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.290 align:middle line:84%
we're at this kind of ultimate
precession point in terms

00:20:58.290 --> 00:20:59.970 align:middle line:90%
of precessional change.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:02.877 align:middle line:90%
And so at that point--

00:21:02.877 --> 00:21:04.710 align:middle line:84%
I guess the best example
that I could give--

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm having to give
five to seven examples

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:09.700 align:middle line:84%
of low Aquarius
versus high Aquarius--

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.510 align:middle line:84%
so let's take
artificial intelligence.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Because right now, all
of us are struggling

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.190 align:middle line:84%
with very, very
negative attributes

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.260 align:middle line:90%
of artificial intelligence--

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:23.620 align:middle line:84%
loss of social cohesion
and political influence

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.500 align:middle line:90%
and interference, et cetera.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:29.790 align:middle line:84%
It's just absolutely horrendous
and, worse than that, just

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:32.250 align:middle line:84%
making more and more
energy all the time

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.610 align:middle line:84%
in order to run computers
and everybody sending photos

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:36.840 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.660 align:middle line:84%
But meanwhile, cell towers
are catching the forests

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.550 align:middle line:90%
on fire in California.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:45.540 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we're just
burning hot, hot energy.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to
find a way to work

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:51.415 align:middle line:84%
with energy that is going to
be in harmony with the planet.

00:21:51.415 --> 00:21:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:53.290 align:middle line:90%
It's already here.

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:55.582 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do is utilize
it and make it a priority.

00:21:55.582 --> 00:21:56.457 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's right.

00:21:56.457 --> 00:21:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what you're
saying is the development

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.180 align:middle line:84%
of the AI, for example, and
its intrusion into our--

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.860 align:middle line:84%
horrid, really, intrusion
into-- our lives

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.890 align:middle line:84%
because now it's taken over
to an extent where it just

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:09.837 align:middle line:84%
doesn't even care what
the end user thinks.

00:22:09.837 --> 00:22:11.670 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to shove
things in your face

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:12.990 align:middle line:90%
you're not interested in.

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:14.970 align:middle line:84%
It's going to ignore
your requests.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:18.280 align:middle line:84%
It has so much hubris,
it's become stupid.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yes.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:19.880 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So would you
say that that, too,

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.690 align:middle line:84%
is still in the service of that
reptilian, fourth-dimension

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:26.490 align:middle line:90%
energy?

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:27.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yes.

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:29.580 align:middle line:84%
The issue here,
the whole spectrum

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:34.290 align:middle line:84%
of artificial intelligence
needs to be multi-dimensional.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Artificial intelligence
could access very high

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:40.780 align:middle line:90%
dimensional consciousness.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And so we, as users of
artificial intelligence,

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:47.370 align:middle line:84%
need to start discerning
what kind of level

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:48.760 align:middle line:90%
we're going to be at.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to be
at a reptilian level

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:54.180 align:middle line:84%
where you're under the
influence of total mind control,

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.830 align:middle line:84%
just play with your
smartphone all day

00:22:56.830 --> 00:23:00.210 align:middle line:84%
and not use your smartphone
for what it could do,

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:02.550 align:middle line:84%
which would be to take
you into many other zones

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:05.160 align:middle line:90%
and many other realities.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.830 align:middle line:84%
So I can't emphasize
enough how much

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:11.820 align:middle line:84%
what the individual is
doing right now matters.

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I totally
agree with you on that.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.433 align:middle line:84%
And let me just give
a couple of examples.

00:23:16.433 --> 00:23:17.850 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking
about what you

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:19.680 align:middle line:84%
could be doing with
your smartphone,

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.050 align:middle line:84%
there was an app I was
exposed to very recently,

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.030 align:middle line:90%
and I haven't downloaded it yet.

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:29.040 align:middle line:84%
What it does is it shows kind of
HeartMath like, in a HeartMath

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:34.860 align:middle line:84%
sense, the field and where
emotions and thoughts

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.420 align:middle line:90%
are rising on a global level.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.140 align:middle line:84%
So you can see where
consciousness is rising

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:43.390 align:middle line:84%
and where consciousness
is falling like a living,

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:47.070 align:middle line:90%
breathing view of the Earth.

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.810 align:middle line:90%
But it's human consciousness.

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
tapping in, they're

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.650 align:middle line:84%
able to tap in now, through
various instrumentation

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:55.530 align:middle line:84%
to the level of consciousness,
the level of fear,

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:58.080 align:middle line:84%
versus peace or calm
that is happening

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.910 align:middle line:84%
within a human and a
collective of humans.

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:05.160 align:middle line:84%
There are other apps similar to
this-- not exactly like that--

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.300 align:middle line:84%
that also serve, are
tapping into, and validating

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.380 align:middle line:84%
the use of our
higher consciousness.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Mm-hmm.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:12.280 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No one knows them.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:13.620 align:middle line:84%
No one knows
anything about these.

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And so people need to
create those kind of apps,

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.260 align:middle line:84%
and they need to use
those kind of apps.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And another one that's coming is
called the Blue Brain Project.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And what's going on with
the Blue Brain Project,

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.980 align:middle line:84%
and I have been
following this as much

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:32.470 align:middle line:84%
as I can because there's some
kind of informational shutdown

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:33.270 align:middle line:90%
on this right now.

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:35.818 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how much people
are going to be able to access.

00:24:35.818 --> 00:24:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us all about it.

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:41.040 align:middle line:10%
So a group of scientists
have found a way to,

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:46.410 align:middle line:10%
with huge computers, to map
the dimensional frequencies

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:47.460 align:middle line:10%
of the human brain.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:50.460 align:middle line:10%
And they're doing this
by means of topology,

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.290 align:middle line:10%
which I call rubber geometry.

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:54.540 align:middle line:10%
It's a whole range
of mathematics

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:57.840 align:middle line:10%
that has to do with all of the
different angles and shapes

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.970 align:middle line:10%
that exist within mathematics.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something
I can explain here.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.660 align:middle line:84%
If you talked to
a topologist, you

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.330 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be able to figure
out what he was talking about.

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:08.190 align:middle line:84%
But these topologists
have managed

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:11.340 align:middle line:84%
to create images of the
different dimensions

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.890 align:middle line:90%
of the human brain.

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And the most important
news is that they

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.290 align:middle line:84%
have been able to
make images of 11

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:21.970 align:middle line:90%
dimensions in the human brain.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is
critically important.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Pleaidians said that
we humans can only access

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.560 align:middle line:90%
nine dimensions at this time.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And so with the issue of 11
dimensions in the human brain,

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:37.620 align:middle line:84%
we now know that our
brains are functioning

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.170 align:middle line:90%
according to string theory.

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, this means
that technologies

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:46.950 align:middle line:84%
and artificial intelligence
can be developed

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:50.460 align:middle line:84%
based on all of the
dimensions of string

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.960 align:middle line:84%
theory and, therefore,
the human brain.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very good example
of the kind of direction

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.000 align:middle line:84%
that we need to go into
with higher Aquarius.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Still, it has to be
at the hand of human creativity.

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, that's
the interesting part.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Looking at it in its
most afflicted way

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.200 align:middle line:84%
is to supplant human
consciousness with something

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.480 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't serve us.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And it takes the
humans to create

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.768 align:middle line:84%
that, or the human-reptilian
collaboration to create.

00:26:23.768 --> 00:26:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Or people
under mind control.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Under mind
control to create that.

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.510 align:middle line:84%
So at what point,
since this is all

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:34.600 align:middle line:84%
a life and a game of illusion,
so to speak, or perception?

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:35.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.260 align:middle line:84%
This is where it goes
back to the individual

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:42.030 align:middle line:84%
again is if we start developing
those higher states of mind

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.580 align:middle line:90%
in our own consciousness.

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I'm
writing the trilogy

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:49.950 align:middle line:84%
is I'm actually trying to show
people doing that in order

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:52.500 align:middle line:90%
to teach how that can be done.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Then the thing that's
critically important to realize

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:58.440 align:middle line:84%
is the fourth-dimensional
mind control

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.200 align:middle line:84%
can't take us over if we're
functioning at those higher

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.000 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It can't.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: As soon as we're in
the heart or in the logos--

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:07.950 align:middle line:84%
the sixth dimension-- or in
the seventh-dimensional light

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.800 align:middle line:84%
or in the mind of the divine
in the eighth dimension

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:15.240 align:middle line:84%
or in the center of the
universe, the galaxy,

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.370 align:middle line:84%
the reptilians can't
control us anymore.

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:19.295 align:middle line:84%
We just move out
of their sphere.

00:27:19.295 --> 00:27:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We move out
of that frequency band.

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:22.712 align:middle line:10%
>>CLOW: And as I
said to you earlier,

00:27:22.712 --> 00:27:24.510 align:middle line:10%
as we go through this
crisis that we're

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:26.730 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of
right now, I'm tuning

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.920 align:middle line:10%
in to them more than usual.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.770 align:middle line:10%
I got a lot of criticism
in "Pleaidian Agenda"

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:34.440 align:middle line:10%
for channeling
positive reptiles.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.050 align:middle line:84%
King Lizard was one
of my favorites.

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:39.900 align:middle line:84%
But the reptiles
want to take a break.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Probably, they want to
take a permanent vacation.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.550 align:middle line:90%
They're tired of it.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And if we can just continue
this beautiful creativity

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.940 align:middle line:84%
that we possess, it's unlimited
the levels that we could go to.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And so this goes back to this
issue of an extinction going on

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.420 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.910 align:middle line:84%
What's happening
is we are living

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:03.880 align:middle line:84%
through the extinction of
the fourth-dimensional mind

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.680 align:middle line:90%
control.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:08.070 align:middle line:84%
We're living with an
extinction of the reptilians

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:10.597 align:middle line:90%
having undue influence on us.

00:28:10.597 --> 00:28:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That means
we're also living

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:14.640 align:middle line:84%
through the extinction of
what we've come to embrace

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.870 align:middle line:90%
is our own self-identity.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Mm-hmm.

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.100 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we have to let
go of the perception of that.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a
person who identifies

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:25.920 align:middle line:84%
with your elite bloodline
and your elite identity,

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.880 align:middle line:84%
you might want to think
a little bit about what

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.020 align:middle line:90%
you're identifying with.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And so, Regina, I'd like to
go to another example that's

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:37.560 align:middle line:84%
going to be very hard
to discuss in public.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.600 align:middle line:84%
But as I come from my heart,
and as I come from my center,

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.950 align:middle line:84%
it's something that I
feel I must speak about

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:45.750 align:middle line:84%
as I've been working
on the trilogy

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:48.000 align:middle line:84%
and also observing
what's going on.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to introduce
some issues connected

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:51.860 align:middle line:90%
with transgender.

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I'd
like to bring that up

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.690 align:middle line:84%
is because for people to
have difficulty understanding

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.960 align:middle line:84%
their identity and to have
difficulty understanding

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.180 align:middle line:90%
their gender from birth.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's just one of the most
difficult and painful issues

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:08.760 align:middle line:84%
because people who
are struggling with it

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.580 align:middle line:84%
are very, very
defensive about it.

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Because it's just so private
and intense for them.

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I would like to just
take this as an opportunity

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:23.310 align:middle line:84%
to suggest what I would do
if I was struggling with this

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:26.940 align:middle line:84%
or if my child was struggling
with it or something like that.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And I just have to
say that I think

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:30.840 align:middle line:84%
it's critically
important for people

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:34.830 align:middle line:84%
to insist on therapy,
particularly past life

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:35.850 align:middle line:90%
regression.

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:40.080 align:middle line:84%
If I had a child who was going
through a gender identification

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.560 align:middle line:84%
issue, I would want them to
have some past life regression

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:48.450 align:middle line:84%
therapy in order to experience
life in another gender.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Because if they were to
experience-- like in my case,

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:54.750 align:middle line:84%
I've been incarnated as
a male almost exclusively

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:57.630 align:middle line:84%
the last 5,000 years
because I couldn't

00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:01.990 align:middle line:84%
do what I need to do on this
planet as a female until now.

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And so by going
back and exploring

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.560 align:middle line:84%
all of these male lifetimes
where I had a lot of power,

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't need male power.

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:11.970 align:middle line:90%
I have female power.

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And my male side is, of course,
very developed because of that.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.540 align:middle line:84%
So I just am kind of taking
this as an opportunity

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:22.590 align:middle line:84%
because I think people are
really in crisis at this point.

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't think
that the medical programs

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:28.760 align:middle line:84%
that are assisting people
are helping people at all.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.980 align:middle line:84%
I think the first
choice needs to be

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:35.480 align:middle line:84%
an exploration of
androgyny and exploration

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:39.120 align:middle line:84%
of what it's like to
be the opposite sex.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the thing that
has kind of flummoxed me

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:45.800 align:middle line:84%
when I look at the
phenomena of transgenderism

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.100 align:middle line:84%
is that when we have
a soul contract, when

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:52.130 align:middle line:84%
we choose an
incarnation or we choose

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:54.920 align:middle line:84%
to incarnate within a
family or within a vehicle

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.830 align:middle line:84%
that we can utilize
for the soul's purpose,

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:02.910 align:middle line:84%
we know which sex our
physical body is at that time.

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:07.910 align:middle line:84%
So how did it happen, suddenly,
where so many people ended up

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:09.860 align:middle line:90%
in the wrong bodies?

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, on a soul level,
that doesn't make sense.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Why would someone choose
the opposite kind of body

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.820 align:middle line:84%
that their soul
contract required

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:21.600 align:middle line:84%
and then have to go to the
extreme, and extremely painful

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.880 align:middle line:84%
processes on many levels, of
trying to switch midstream?

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:27.290 align:middle line:90%
That part I don't understand.

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:28.090 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of people
don't understand that.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's a few
significant answers to that.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.780 align:middle line:84%
First of all,
unfortunately, it could

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:39.530 align:middle line:84%
be hormones that are influencing
people through plastic.

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that has
been explored by scientists.

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And if that is the
case, there needs

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:49.010 align:middle line:84%
to be a lot of work
done with that issue,

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:50.093 align:middle line:90%
regarding plastics itself.

00:31:50.093 --> 00:31:52.385 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's altering
our hormonal balance itself,

00:31:52.385 --> 00:31:54.310 align:middle line:84%
to where it's actually
identifying otherwise.

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.516 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:31:54.516 --> 00:31:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Because I have no
doubt whatsoever

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:57.440 align:middle line:84%
that people who were
dealing with this

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.800 align:middle line:84%
are absolutely
sincere and deeply

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.750 align:middle line:84%
feel the dilemma that
they're dealing with.

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:05.450 align:middle line:84%
But the better answer
that I can offer,

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:09.500 align:middle line:84%
since I can't get into the
issue of hormones and plastics--

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:10.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm not an expert--

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm just
thinking, looking at it

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.710 align:middle line:84%
from a soul level, why would
we choose the wrong body?

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:14.418 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: I'm not an
expert in that at all.

00:32:14.418 --> 00:32:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think we haven't
chosen the wrong body.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:20.120 align:middle line:84%
I think what people are dealing
with who have this feeling--

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.380 align:middle line:90%
many of them--

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:26.690 align:middle line:84%
is Uranus-- back to the
issue of the Age of Aquarius.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And as we move into
Aquarius-- at this point,

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.790 align:middle line:84%
it's been really heavy on
for about 30 or 40 years.

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And now we're really
into it, at this point.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:35.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm an Aquarian.

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:37.220 align:middle line:90%
My husband's an Aquarian.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And we Aquarians are
completely androgynous.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.070 align:middle line:90%
We're half male and half female.

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:48.120 align:middle line:84%
If you get to know us, we're
just completely gender-free.

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I think what's happening
is as Aquarius is coming in

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:54.920 align:middle line:84%
strongly, there's a
great desire to be

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.030 align:middle line:90%
gender-free for all of us.

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:58.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now, that makes sense.

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And I think
what's happening right now

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:05.630 align:middle line:84%
is the lower level of the
issue is what's manifesting.

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is trying
to change the physical body

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:09.855 align:middle line:84%
to match the internal
desire for androgyny.

00:33:09.855 --> 00:33:10.730 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: That's right.

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:11.530 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, some
people are hermaphroditic.

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And some people
have issues-- not

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:18.460 align:middle line:84%
this is not a real
thing for some people,

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.280 align:middle line:84%
but it's an issue
of how many people.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think for those
who were born, clearly,

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:28.070 align:middle line:84%
into a male or
female body, I think

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:32.210 align:middle line:84%
that you've got to understand
that this Uranian influence is

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.683 align:middle line:84%
causing you to want to
be the opposite sex.

00:33:34.683 --> 00:33:35.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: And yet you can be both.

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:41.420 align:middle line:84%
You can keep your
physical body as it is,

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:44.780 align:middle line:84%
and you can have a completely
male presence in the world.

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
do it with your hair

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:48.440 align:middle line:90%
or your physical body.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.560 align:middle line:84%
You can do it with the
way you live your life

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.856 align:middle line:84%
and the way you
choose what you do.

00:33:53.856 --> 00:33:54.656 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:54.656 --> 00:33:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Because it's been
well established

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:56.570 align:middle line:90%
you can love who you wish.

00:33:56.570 --> 00:34:00.110 align:middle line:84%
That's already well established
and accepted on the planet,

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:02.330 align:middle line:84%
in most of the
Western world, anyway.

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And so you can have that
experience on the heart

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.330 align:middle line:90%
level, relationship-wise.

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:12.407 align:middle line:84%
But to anatomically
change the body--

00:34:12.407 --> 00:34:14.449 align:middle line:84%
and the extra step, it
sounds like you're saying,

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:18.520 align:middle line:84%
is not necessary to the
process of if I'm a female

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:22.540 align:middle line:84%
and want to be a man, I
embrace the man inside me,

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.610 align:middle line:84%
and I can live as a
man, make decisions

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:28.250 align:middle line:84%
as a man, love someone
as a man would.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:29.375 align:middle line:90%
That's my right as a human.

00:34:29.375 --> 00:34:30.175 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:34:30.175 --> 00:34:31.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a good way to express it.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:32.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:33.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So I think these are two good
examples, one very emotional,

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:39.010 align:middle line:84%
because transgender
is very emotional,

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:41.389 align:middle line:84%
and then the issue of
artificial intelligence.

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:45.739 align:middle line:84%
It's an issue of the Aquarian
Uranian influence, which

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:47.870 align:middle line:90%
is just so intense for people.

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And whenever we change an age,
which is what we're doing now,

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:56.420 align:middle line:84%
it's just as intense now
as it was 2,000 years ago,

00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:00.560 align:middle line:84%
when we see people struggling
with that Archon influence.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Every time we go
through this, we

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:05.600 align:middle line:84%
go into almost a
fourth-dimensional chaos,

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:06.620 align:middle line:90%
you could say.

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Because what explains the
fact that almost every country

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.737 align:middle line:84%
in the world right now
is completely polarized?

00:35:11.737 --> 00:35:13.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not just the United States.

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, no this is global.

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:14.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Everywhere.

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And everybody in every country
is going, what happened?

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.280 align:middle line:84%
We're all split in
two, and we used

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.580 align:middle line:90%
to be able to work together.

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.140 align:middle line:90%
We can't work together.

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:25.400 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens when
you move into a new age.

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And so if we go
back 10,000 years,

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Regina, the precessional
teaching of moving from one age

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.990 align:middle line:84%
to the other was a high
spiritual teaching.

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And there were schools
of spiritual teachers

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:42.290 align:middle line:84%
who taught people about
letting go of the old age

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:44.820 align:middle line:84%
and how to adopt
the new frequencies.

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And so 2,000 years ago,
unfortunately, the Archons

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:50.750 align:middle line:90%
got their way.

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And they continue to
influence way, way too

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:56.210 align:middle line:90%
much into the age of Pisces.

00:35:56.210 --> 00:36:00.140 align:middle line:84%
They've influenced us way too
much the last 2,000 years.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they co-opted
our realms of perception

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:06.710 align:middle line:84%
and then started shifting
and intentionally interfering

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:08.260 align:middle line:90%
with the way our mind adopts.

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.010 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, I'll be
more clear about it.

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:11.310 align:middle line:90%
Here's what they did.

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:15.410 align:middle line:84%
They completely destroyed all
of the philosophical schools

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:16.730 align:middle line:90%
that teach about precession.

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:17.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very true.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:19.112 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: So they
destroyed the Stoics.

00:36:19.112 --> 00:36:22.340 align:middle line:84%
The main teachers 2,000
years ago about precession

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.600 align:middle line:90%
were the Stoics.

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And they destroyed the
Gnostics because they

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:29.750 align:middle line:84%
knew that if people
wised up, so to speak,

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:33.860 align:middle line:84%
understanding precession and
how to work with it consciously

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:36.590 align:middle line:84%
is a very, very,
very wise teaching.

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what my
trilogy is all about.

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:42.560 align:middle line:84%
It's such a complicated
thing that the only way

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.240 align:middle line:84%
I could imagine
describing it was

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:47.150 align:middle line:84%
through a group of very,
very bright characters.

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:52.430 align:middle line:84%
So I created a group of, really,
genius-level people to watch

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:54.320 align:middle line:90%
what's happening right now--

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.637 align:middle line:90%
basically, 2011 to 2020.

00:36:56.637 --> 00:36:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I've known you
through this whole journey.

00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And I've known what
it's taken from you

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:05.060 align:middle line:84%
to have to get down and
live in that reality

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:08.330 align:middle line:84%
to be able to express through
each of these characters.

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:10.773 align:middle line:84%
And I know just a little
bit about where it's going.

00:37:10.773 --> 00:37:12.440 align:middle line:84%
But I certainly do
know where it's been,

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.900 align:middle line:84%
and we've done interviews
on those books.

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is coming to terms
with the darkest in our psyche.

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Because it's happening
now in pop culture.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.980 align:middle line:84%
There's even an series,
a TV Showtime show

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:27.020 align:middle line:84%
called "Ray Donovan,"
what you speak

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.390 align:middle line:84%
of-- the influence
of the institutions,

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:32.540 align:middle line:84%
of the Church, of the dark
arts, the fallen angels.

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And all of this is speaking
to something in ourselves.

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:46.490 align:middle line:84%
How do we gracefully,
compassionately hold

00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:50.240 align:middle line:84%
that part of our
collective psyche

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.780 align:middle line:84%
that has succumbed
to such dark things?

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, first of all,
in the third dimension,

00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:00.210 align:middle line:84%
we all need to do anything
that any one of us can do,

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:03.500 align:middle line:84%
such as issues of sexual
slavery or issues--

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To stop it.

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:06.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Stop it.

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:07.400 align:middle line:90%
My whole trilogy--

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On the ground,
that's what we do.

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:10.652 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: --the first book,
in particular, stop it.

00:38:10.652 --> 00:38:14.420 align:middle line:84%
The point is, as we let go
of that kind of influence

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:16.310 align:middle line:84%
and that kind of
control, we need

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:17.550 align:middle line:90%
to understand how it works.

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:18.350 align:middle line:90%
We need to--

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:19.725 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:38:19.725 --> 00:38:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Because it's hard to hold that
with some kind of compassion

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:29.380 align:middle line:84%
if we don't even understand
how it got there.

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:31.700 align:middle line:90%
So that's called sleuthing.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.980 align:middle line:84%
The first issue is, in
the third dimension,

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:36.830 align:middle line:84%
if you have a chance to
help somebody or give

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:39.640 align:middle line:84%
money or change something,
you've got to do it.

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:40.550 align:middle line:90%
You have to.

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And I know I do, and
I know you do, too.

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:46.260 align:middle line:84%
But then, the next level is
what's going on in our minds.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, our minds are
11-dimensional teleprompters.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And in our minds, when we
study what a person like,

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:57.680 align:middle line:84%
let's say, Jeffrey
Epstein was doing,

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:02.390 align:middle line:84%
when we take responsibility
for taking a cold, clear look

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:06.180 align:middle line:84%
at what was going on there
and what happened with that--

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.970 align:middle line:84%
and there's many,
many other examples,

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:11.345 align:middle line:90%
that's just one example--

00:39:11.345 --> 00:39:13.760 align:middle line:84%
this is very
important in the world

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.310 align:middle line:84%
that we're in now,
just by exploring

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:20.090 align:middle line:84%
difficult, dark thoughts
and difficult, dark energy,

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:22.940 align:middle line:84%
you are actually
changing things.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By being willing
to take the wool off it

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:27.140 align:middle line:90%
and look at it.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:27.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Our minds.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:29.590 align:middle line:90%
Ours minds change reality.

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:32.570 align:middle line:84%
The fact that millions
and millions of people

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:35.602 align:middle line:84%
know what Jeffrey Epstein
was doing makes a difference.

00:39:35.602 --> 00:39:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it does.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.143 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: It makes a
very big difference

00:39:38.143 --> 00:39:42.170 align:middle line:84%
to the young girls, who are
now women, who were abused.

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:45.410 align:middle line:84%
What changes the abuse
factor, like, for example,

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:48.560 align:middle line:84%
with somebody like Harvey
Weinstein, is enough

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:51.020 align:middle line:84%
people just continue
to tell the truth.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And I've told the
truth about abuse

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.350 align:middle line:84%
that I experienced
as a young child.

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:59.870 align:middle line:84%
We have to continue to tell the
truth until this finally stops.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:03.830 align:middle line:84%
This is a key issue
going into Aquarius.

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when you
go back to Epstein,

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:09.560 align:middle line:84%
the primary procurer of the
girls was another woman.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And now, this is something that
I haven't ever really talked

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:17.060 align:middle line:84%
with anyone about, but I think
maybe this is a conversation

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:17.900 align:middle line:90%
to bring it up.

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:21.230 align:middle line:84%
When we're looking at the darkly
afflicted aspects of self,

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:25.250 align:middle line:84%
the shadow, I've seen a
prevalence of a situation

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:29.870 align:middle line:84%
in which women, and young
women in particular,

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:34.700 align:middle line:84%
who have moved out of the
traditional nuclear family with

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:37.010 align:middle line:84%
a mother and father-- which
we've known for thousands

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:42.470 align:middle line:84%
of years, and it had its own
affliction, certainly, a lot--

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:44.010 align:middle line:90%
but we've moved away from that.

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:46.280 align:middle line:84%
We're moving out of the
patriarchal paradigm.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.290 align:middle line:90%
We're consciously choosing to.

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:51.590 align:middle line:84%
But the women, if you've
been dominantly incarnating

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:55.430 align:middle line:84%
as a female, you've only
had certain survival tools

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:57.740 align:middle line:90%
at your disposal--

00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:01.190 align:middle line:84%
manipulation, right?
that's a big one,

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:05.900 align:middle line:84%
to operate in secrecy and in
the shadows, and to undermine

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and such to be able to move
things in an unconscious way

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.330 align:middle line:90%
to get what you want.

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Because you couldn't
do it overtly.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.260 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't take
on power overtly.

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.120 align:middle line:84%
So these are highly
developed skills

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:20.480 align:middle line:84%
within the being
that has dominantly

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.120 align:middle line:90%
incarnated as female.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And now that those restrictions
are being taken off and women

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.600 align:middle line:84%
can stand up-- they can
become professional, doctors,

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:32.450 align:middle line:84%
run for office, everything in
the third dimension that a man

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:35.210 align:middle line:84%
can do, essentially,
women can do now--

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:38.030 align:middle line:90%
there is a dark thing happening.

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:40.660 align:middle line:90%


00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:42.110 align:middle line:90%
I am seeing it up close.

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, other people
talk to me, come to me.

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing it
everywhere where

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:51.710 align:middle line:84%
these young women are taking
into life and partnerships

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:55.400 align:middle line:84%
and not knowing
how to use energy

00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:01.850 align:middle line:84%
in a positive, powerful way,
and use extreme manipulation

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:06.590 align:middle line:84%
and delusion and control
in their relationships

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:09.380 align:middle line:84%
with other people, particularly
with men who have kind of been

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.197 align:middle line:90%
raised by women.

00:42:11.197 --> 00:42:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And see, this is
a very powerful statement

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.330 align:middle line:90%
on your part.

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Because what you've just
described is a waking up.

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:21.150 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't have probably been
able to make that statement

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:23.452 align:middle line:84%
and describe that so
well 10 or 20 years ago.

00:42:23.452 --> 00:42:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, because I couldn't
see the phenomena so much.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: So what
we're talking about,

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:30.740 align:middle line:84%
the things we're talking
about, have always gone on.

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:34.038 align:middle line:84%
The difference--
well, let me say--

00:42:34.038 --> 00:42:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it was
operating under the surface.

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.705 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: --this is
the last 5,000 years.

00:42:37.705 --> 00:42:39.350 align:middle line:84%
This is more the
patriarchal phase.

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:41.540 align:middle line:84%
But now what's happening
is we're coming out

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:43.070 align:middle line:90%
of the patriarchal phase.

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:45.830 align:middle line:84%
What's happening is
the real exposure

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:48.260 align:middle line:90%
of how this functions, works.

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And so for a young woman who
would be inclined to manipulate

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:56.420 align:middle line:84%
and use sexual power and
all that to get someplace,

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.970 align:middle line:84%
she's not going to be as likely
to do that anymore now as she

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:00.530 align:middle line:90%
would have 10 or 20 years ago.

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:03.770 align:middle line:84%
She's seeing all
kinds of other ways

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:09.127 align:middle line:84%
to be who she is without
having to revert back to those.

00:43:09.127 --> 00:43:10.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's half the story.

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.200 align:middle line:84%
The other half is
the one who is not

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.810 align:middle line:84%
seeing how to fully
empower oneself yet,

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:18.760 align:middle line:84%
who is still using those but
in more overt ways than ever.

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah, it's true.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:20.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and this is what I
think is really shifting fast,

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:23.840 align:middle line:90%
Regina.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.300 align:middle line:84%
I really do, as we
shift out of the control

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.530 align:middle line:90%
of the nuclear family.

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:30.980 align:middle line:84%
I think that there's
many more women every day

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:33.530 align:middle line:84%
who might have taken
that option who now

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:35.693 align:middle line:90%
get to see what happens to you.

00:43:35.693 --> 00:43:37.610 align:middle line:84%
See that's this exposure
of what has happened.

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:39.193 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the
glory side of it.

00:43:39.193 --> 00:43:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: The power of these
women coming forth and telling

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:44.540 align:middle line:84%
their story and what
happened to them is just

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:45.860 align:middle line:90%
such a critical piece.

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And I've done it, and
other people have done it.

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:50.030 align:middle line:84%
It's critically
important at this point.

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:51.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:53.598 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for sharing that.

00:43:53.598 --> 00:43:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to show the
high and the afflicted part.

00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:58.307 align:middle line:84%
Because there is an afflicted
part going on, and it's more

00:43:58.307 --> 00:43:59.631 align:middle line:90%
pronounced because you can.

00:43:59.631 --> 00:44:01.923 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And then, also, let's
bring Uranus back into it

00:44:01.923 --> 00:44:02.190 align:middle line:90%
for a minute--

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
bring it back, yeah.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: --going into Aquarius.

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And Uranian energy
rules Kundalini energy.

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:10.850 align:middle line:84%
The planet Uranus rules
Kundalini, which is something

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:13.040 align:middle line:90%
that I wrote a book about.

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:16.870 align:middle line:84%
But at any rate, Kundalini
energy is very sexual.

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And so right now because of the
heavy duty influence of Uranus,

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:26.163 align:middle line:84%
we're in a
hypersexualized field.

00:44:26.163 --> 00:44:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And as we move
more deeply into Aquarius,

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Aquarius is also cool
and intellectual and

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.790 align:middle line:90%
transformational.

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:36.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: More
androgynous, as you say.

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah, and androgynous.

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you'll see these
energies transform.

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:41.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.160 align:middle line:84%
No one has actually
explained that.

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.993 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, there's
only one way to do it.

00:44:43.993 --> 00:44:46.410 align:middle line:84%
It's what each one of us is
doing in this act, basically.

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:47.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:48.740 align:middle line:90%
True.

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:51.420 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about a little bit.

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:55.180 align:middle line:84%
So again, because I'm trying to
bring forward the ways in which

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:57.950 align:middle line:84%
we have succumbed to this
kind of mind control.

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:01.910 align:middle line:84%
So we go back to a time of
the story of fallen angels.

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And we talk about how the
cabal, the bloodlines,

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:10.820 align:middle line:84%
have been able to use forbidden
or secret arts against humanity

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:12.410 align:middle line:90%
instead of for humanity.

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I want us to be
able to walk away

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:15.620 align:middle line:84%
from this and
every single person

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:19.310 align:middle line:84%
watching this say, oh,
I've been manipulated

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:20.720 align:middle line:90%
in this way, this way, this way.

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.310 align:middle line:90%
These are the mechanisms.

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:23.430 align:middle line:90%
I can unplug from that.

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Mm-hmm.

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:27.830 align:middle line:84%
I've been an astrologer for 40,
50 years, something like that.

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And the last thing
anybody with any decency

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.740 align:middle line:84%
would ever do is be an
astrologer, right, or be a palm

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.630 align:middle line:84%
reader or whatever
you're going to do.

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And what I've noticed
over the years

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:45.050 align:middle line:84%
is the elite Cabal controllers
using astrology like crazy.

00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:48.520 align:middle line:84%
An astrologer can tell whether
a government is using astrology.

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And most of them do.

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:51.230 align:middle line:90%
Most of them do, right.

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:53.030 align:middle line:84%
What we do as
astrologers, who watch

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:57.380 align:middle line:84%
the timing of a particular
event that they create, the best

00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:01.670 align:middle line:84%
example being the invasion of
Iraq at the spring equinox in,

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:05.780 align:middle line:84%
I think, it was 2003, where
Bush planned the whole invasion

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:09.200 align:middle line:84%
right at the spring equinox,
which is the most powerful time

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:12.050 align:middle line:90%
to create a new paradigm.

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:14.450 align:middle line:84%
So we watch to see when
they create things,

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and then we know
they use astrologers.

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:18.200 align:middle line:90%
Reagan had 12 astrologers.

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:19.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and they
were famous for that.

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: People thought
he had only three.

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:21.920 align:middle line:90%
He had 12 astrologers, OK?

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:25.860 align:middle line:84%
So at this point, OK, we
know they use astrologers.

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So why are they acting like
every astrologer out there

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:30.560 align:middle line:90%
is an idiot?

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:36.110 align:middle line:84%
So what they do is they
put down the magical arts

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:39.650 align:middle line:84%
that they're using to
control the planet to keep us

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:41.335 align:middle line:90%
from using them ourselves.

00:46:41.335 --> 00:46:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For tools
for our own growth.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:43.072 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:46:43.072 --> 00:46:43.970 align:middle line:90%
These are our tools.

00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:45.230 align:middle line:90%
We need divination.

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:46.490 align:middle line:90%
We need astrology.

00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:48.980 align:middle line:90%
We need channeling.

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:50.430 align:middle line:90%
We need all of these things.

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And we need to understand that
if the elite can't control

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.560 align:middle line:84%
those things anymore,
if we take them back,

00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:00.022 align:middle line:84%
then our reality again
is going to shift.

00:47:00.022 --> 00:47:01.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is changing
pretty dramatically.

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:03.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, otherwise,
Gaia wouldn't exist.

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:04.553 align:middle line:90%
It would have no traction.

00:47:04.553 --> 00:47:06.470 align:middle line:90%
It would have no membership.

00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:08.815 align:middle line:90%
And so it is changing.

00:47:08.815 --> 00:47:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at the
same time, to me,

00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:12.860 align:middle line:84%
it's still galling to
see the mainstream media,

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:16.730 align:middle line:84%
that these things are put
down as jokes, essentially,

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:21.680 align:middle line:84%
as infantile instruments of
wish, a world of wishing.

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:24.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And the best example
is the fall of Atlantis.

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of what we're talking
about today and the cataclysm.

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:32.960 align:middle line:84%
The whole cataclysmic issue is
actually the fall of Atlantis.

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And so what has happened
for the last 150 years

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:39.940 align:middle line:84%
is if you were a historian,
paleontologist, archaeologist,

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:44.090 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, who even mentioned
the word Atlantis, even

00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:48.500 align:middle line:84%
though we've got the Atlantic
Ocean, et cetera, that was it.

00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:51.360 align:middle line:90%
It was the end of your career.

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And so that is what has kept
us from remembering our story.

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:59.500 align:middle line:84%
By continuing to make
it look like anybody

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:02.030 align:middle line:84%
who talked about
Atlantis was an idiot,

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:07.220 align:middle line:84%
that kept people, for 150
years, away from the fact

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:11.120 align:middle line:84%
that Atlantis was destroyed
and Atlantis ended,

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:14.330 align:middle line:84%
which may be a cycle, or it
may be an actual destruction.

00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:15.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not really clear.

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.590 align:middle line:90%
And so we lost our story.

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And we lost our understanding
of the higher arts,

00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:25.070 align:middle line:84%
for the most part,
except for the few.

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And then the good
thing in all this

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:29.180 align:middle line:84%
is Freddy Silva wrote in
his book called "The Missing

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Lands," he speaks about the ones
called the Shining Ones, which,

00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:36.920 align:middle line:84%
at the end of a devastation,
all these different indigenous

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.020 align:middle line:84%
cultures refer to
them, essentially,

00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:42.170 align:middle line:84%
in one way or another, leading
back to the term of the Shining

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:43.970 align:middle line:90%
Ones, the illuminated ones.

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:48.110 align:middle line:84%
The knowledge does survive,
and the knowledge is reseeded,

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:51.560 align:middle line:84%
and the knowledge from Atlantis
went in many directions

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:55.970 align:middle line:84%
to reseed into the Yucatan,
into the British Isles,

00:48:55.970 --> 00:49:01.460 align:middle line:84%
southern Europe, Africa,
the west coast of Africa

00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:05.870 align:middle line:84%
and even arguably
the Americas, right?

00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:09.540 align:middle line:84%
So this knowledge was
reseeded all over the planet,

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:13.130 align:middle line:84%
the understanding of
what we ultimately lost

00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:16.080 align:middle line:84%
of the higher arts, of
agriculture, and so forth.

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:18.620 align:middle line:90%
So it doesn't all die.

00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:22.010 align:middle line:84%
There are those who come
to reseed knowledge.

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:25.400 align:middle line:84%
But does it have to
go down at all again?

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Well, for me,
the Shining Ones--

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:30.440 align:middle line:84%
and I'm curious to see
what you think about this,

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:33.440 align:middle line:84%
actually-- but for me, they
are eighth-dimensional beings.

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.103 align:middle line:90%
And they're very, very tall.

00:49:35.103 --> 00:49:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, they
are noted as taller.

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: And they do shine.

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:38.515 align:middle line:90%
They do shine.

00:49:38.515 --> 00:49:40.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And their
eyes are different,

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:40.870 align:middle line:90%
and their eyes shine.

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:42.995 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And the best
descriptions I've read of them

00:49:42.995 --> 00:49:45.890 align:middle line:84%
in some literature is,
like, in Iranian literature

00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:47.390 align:middle line:90%
and Enochian--

00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:49.250 align:middle line:90%
the issue of the Book of Enoch.

00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:51.890 align:middle line:90%
And so they do appear.

00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And they're, actually,
in the eighth dimension,

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:55.377 align:middle line:90%
as far as I can tell.

00:49:55.377 --> 00:49:56.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, interesting.

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Yeah.

00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And they appear periodically
to different cultures.

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Different cultures have
a very long lineage

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:05.450 align:middle line:84%
of teaching about
the Shining Ones.

00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:06.875 align:middle line:84%
And I think you
went to Sardinia--

00:50:06.875 --> 00:50:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: --and picked up
some information about that.

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because I was
intrigued with the Shining

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:12.580 align:middle line:90%
Ones.

00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:15.013 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: I'm curious
what you picked up.

00:50:15.013 --> 00:50:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
it was interesting

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:18.470 align:middle line:84%
because I went into
each of the caves

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:20.455 align:middle line:84%
and did a private
meditation after we

00:50:20.455 --> 00:50:22.970 align:middle line:84%
were done shooting,
or sometimes before,

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:25.460 align:middle line:84%
and just tried to tap
into what was going on.

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And there were several
viewings I had.

00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:30.200 align:middle line:84%
But the one that I thought
was the most interesting,

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:33.020 align:middle line:84%
we were in the Nuraghi,
the beehive type

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:36.980 align:middle line:84%
of beautiful structure
that Freddy Silva, I think,

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:40.340 align:middle line:84%
calculated to be roughly
9,500 years old or so.

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And as I was in there
by myself meditating,

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:48.250 align:middle line:84%
what I saw is the lore is
that these giant people built

00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:49.125 align:middle line:90%
these for themselves.

00:50:49.125 --> 00:50:50.810 align:middle line:90%
This is all for them.

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:53.180 align:middle line:84%
These are their places,
where they did their thing.

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:54.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's not what I saw.

00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:58.070 align:middle line:84%
I saw that these
illuminated beings

00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:00.620 align:middle line:84%
had gone to this
devastated region

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and, among the people
that were there,

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:05.420 align:middle line:84%
they would choose the
ones that had the highest

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:08.660 align:middle line:90%
mind, the highest potential.

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And they would train
them into the arts,

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:15.290 align:middle line:84%
for example, of seeing so that
they had knowledge of what

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:18.350 align:middle line:84%
was to come, so that
they had the ability

00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:22.220 align:middle line:84%
to see around the corner out
at sea or see into the future

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:23.450 align:middle line:90%
and to know.

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And so these edifices were
to train the local people

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:33.590 align:middle line:84%
in these sacred spaces
to bring this knowledge

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:36.830 align:middle line:84%
to their own people and help
their own cultures flourish

00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:39.200 align:middle line:84%
before they moved on and
would do this elsewhere

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.110 align:middle line:90%
when needed again.

00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: And see, this is
just fascinating to me.

00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Because you mentioned
that Freddy Silva thinks

00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:47.030 align:middle line:90%
it's, like, 9,500 years old.

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And you just cued
me into something

00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:52.760 align:middle line:84%
that I hadn't put
together, really.

00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:55.650 align:middle line:84%
I think these are the beings who
came back after the cataclysms.

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:59.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: Probably from,
like, 11,000 years ago--

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's what I think.

00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: --7,000,
8,000 years ago.

00:52:03.310 --> 00:52:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And they manifested from
very high dimensions, which,

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:07.830 align:middle line:90%
by the way, is very hard to do.

00:52:07.830 --> 00:52:09.880 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to manifest
from a high dimension.

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, into a lower one.

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:12.663 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: You have to
really love the person

00:52:12.663 --> 00:52:13.580 align:middle line:90%
that you're assisting.

00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I think
what you picked up

00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:17.990 align:middle line:84%
on there was that they were
actually helping people

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:20.518 align:middle line:90%
in the Sardinian region--

00:52:20.518 --> 00:52:22.893 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and I think
this is what happens all over.

00:52:22.893 --> 00:52:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CLOW: --in one of
those structures.

00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:24.980 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating.

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
when they reseed,

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:29.570 align:middle line:84%
they're there to teach and to
help grow, not to dominate,

00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:33.830 align:middle line:84%
live alongside, but to
help educate and enlighten

00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:36.080 align:middle line:84%
the local people that
already have it in them

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:36.920 align:middle line:90%
but have forgotten.

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:37.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CLOW: Mm-hmm.

00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, I brought
them in one time.

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:42.830 align:middle line:10%
I was doing a
nine-dimensional activation

00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:45.890 align:middle line:10%
in the forest in New
Hampshire with a group

00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:47.620 align:middle line:10%
of a couple of hundred people.

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And so we awakened
nine dimensions.

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:52.380 align:middle line:90%
This is about 20 years ago now.

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:55.700 align:middle line:10%
And the whole forest
filled with beings--

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:59.330 align:middle line:10%
tall beings of light that
were taller than the trees.

00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:02.170 align:middle line:84%
They must have
been 100 feet tall.

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:03.640 align:middle line:90%
And we all could see them.

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And they just manifested
for just a little

00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:08.660 align:middle line:84%
while for us to somehow tell
us that what we were doing

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:11.180 align:middle line:90%
was good, connected to them.

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This world
is so much more

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:15.740 align:middle line:84%
magnificent than we give
ourselves and this planet

00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:16.700 align:middle line:90%
credit for.

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:17.900 align:middle line:90%
All of this is here.

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:19.410 align:middle line:90%
All of this is possible.

00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:22.610 align:middle line:84%
But it really requires our
taking back our own higher

00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:26.110 align:middle line:84%
heart, as Zeus calls it,
our own higher minds,

00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:28.370 align:middle line:84%
and engaging in life
in a positive way

00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:31.680 align:middle line:84%
to literally construct
this new reality.

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.540 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
to do it together.

00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:34.910 align:middle line:90%
And it starts with us.

00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:37.040 align:middle line:90%
And Barbara, we are out of time.

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And we could continue-- we
didn't get to most of this.

00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:44.270 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have our next
discussion if not before

00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:47.700 align:middle line:84%
but certainly when the third
of the trilogy of the books

00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:48.500 align:middle line:90%
comes out.

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Because what you're
living right now,

00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:53.460 align:middle line:84%
embodying, and working up
toward, is fascinating.

00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:54.260 align:middle line:90%
