>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Judy Wood is not

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.980 align:middle line:84%
concerned with politics
nor conspiracy theory.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.590 align:middle line:84%
This is confounding to many
people who find her book

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.070 align:middle line:84%
to be perhaps the most
controversial portrayal

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.520 align:middle line:84%
of the events of 9/11, an event
that has not found closure

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.020 align:middle line:90%
for those with inquiring minds.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.840 align:middle line:10%
As a scientist with an
insatiable curiosity,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.820 align:middle line:10%
Judy has carefully
compiled data that

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.270 align:middle line:10%
points to something
that leaves us

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.510 align:middle line:10%
breathless in its implications.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.920 align:middle line:10%
She says that the
buildings were destroyed

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:10%
with the most advanced
technology known

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.560 align:middle line:10%
to man, technology that was
withheld from the public

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.890 align:middle line:10%
by Tesla himself for fear
of its devastating effects

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.860 align:middle line:10%
if placed in the wrong hands.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.190 align:middle line:90%
And welcome, Judy.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, it seems to have been
placed in the wrong hands.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.680 align:middle line:84%
But before we even
get into what it is,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.380 align:middle line:84%
I want to run one
tape that shows

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.290 align:middle line:84%
what happened that day and
then some obvious questions

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.980 align:middle line:84%
follow which is why
did we not see this?

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.209 align:middle line:84%
Why did the public not see
what actually happened?

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very big
question because that

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.190 align:middle line:84%
gets into a lot of
other events of history.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.850 align:middle line:84%
First of all, let's take
a look at this video

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see the buildings
beginning to simply,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.869 align:middle line:90%
what you call, dustify.

>>REGINA: Now what
we want to watch

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.810 align:middle line:84%
for here is that little
beam on the right-hand side

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.210 align:middle line:90%
of the screen.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.260 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>JUDY WOOD: It's
like 700 feet tall.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 700 feet tall.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.646 align:middle line:84%
And as you start watching
it, look at this.

00:01:46.646 --> 00:01:47.354 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: It fades.

00:01:47.354 --> 00:01:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Poof.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.250 align:middle line:90%
Poof.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.310 align:middle line:90%
Gone.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we didn't look at
anything else but that one

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.250 align:middle line:84%
piece of evidence, it's telling
a completely different story

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.644 align:middle line:84%
than what everyone
was told that day.

00:02:01.644 --> 00:02:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Something
different is going on.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And you've got the
right statement

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.827 align:middle line:90%
in there, what they were told.

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: We were told
what we were to see.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.220 align:middle line:10%
And what I've learned
about this problem

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.630 align:middle line:10%
of why don't people
see it, I've found

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.830 align:middle line:10%
that there's three
different reasons.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.720 align:middle line:10%
One is problem solving skills.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.670 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of people
say, oh, I have

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.070 align:middle line:10%
good problem solving skills.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.680 align:middle line:84%
But the most important
thing is to first determine

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.810 align:middle line:90%
what happened.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And you must determine
what happened

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.264 align:middle line:84%
before you can tell
how it happened.

00:02:33.264 --> 00:02:33.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Which is before
you can tell who did it.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And they have to
go in that order.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.480 align:middle line:84%
If you do them in
any other order,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.730 align:middle line:90%
you never get to the answer.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet, the
way it was actually

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.070 align:middle line:84%
carried out within the media,
there are so many anomalies

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.924 align:middle line:84%
within the media that
day that we won't even

00:02:48.924 --> 00:02:50.590 align:middle line:84%
have time in an hour
to get to all those

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.660 align:middle line:84%
because we want to
stick with the evidence.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.380 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is that the
names of the players involved

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.160 align:middle line:84%
in everything were there
seemingly within minutes.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.570 align:middle line:84%
That's not how a
normal investigation

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.220 align:middle line:84%
would progress under
any circumstances.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And when that
happens, people then

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.562 align:middle line:84%
assume the problem
that's being solved.

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Once you give them
the answer, they

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.660 align:middle line:84%
assume what the problem is, so
they're now no longer dealing

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.590 align:middle line:84%
with the real problem
but an imagined one.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is
something that you-- you're, I

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.690 align:middle line:84%
think, the beauty of the
way your mind works is

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.205 align:middle line:84%
that when something
isn't jiving for you,

00:03:24.205 --> 00:03:26.820 align:middle line:84%
you cut out the
audio portion of it.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And you were talking
with another person

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.605 align:middle line:90%
I've interviewed, Neil Kramer--

00:03:30.605 --> 00:03:31.105 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yes.

00:03:31.105 --> 00:03:35.614 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -who is a very alert,
intelligent, astute individual.

00:03:35.614 --> 00:03:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And you were telling
me off camera

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.960 align:middle line:84%
he was in France when
this occurred, right?

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yes.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And they're showing it on TV
and without English subtitles.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.280 align:middle line:84%
So if you didn't know
French very well,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.789 align:middle line:84%
which I think he
didn't, he didn't

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:50.580 align:middle line:84%
know what they were
saying so he was trying

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.520 align:middle line:84%
to make out the story
from the images.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.704 align:middle line:84%
So he was looking
at what happened.

00:03:55.704 --> 00:03:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Other people were
looking at what happened, too,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.310 align:middle line:84%
before the story started
being managed and groomed

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.790 align:middle line:84%
into a consistent
story no matter

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:90%
which channel you turned on.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And in that little
interim, there

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.630 align:middle line:84%
was a period of
about 24 to 48 hours

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.980 align:middle line:84%
where you would have some
uncontrolled comments that

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.910 align:middle line:84%
came up, and one of
them was in an interview

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.050 align:middle line:90%
with Peter Jennings.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.820 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.959 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.325 align:middle line:84%
And Peter Jennings, this is just
almost exactly 24 hours later.

00:04:24.325 --> 00:04:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.035 align:middle line:84%

George, I don't know if you
heard a little earlier we

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.530 align:middle line:84%
raised this question which was
actually raised by ABCs Jackie

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.402 align:middle line:84%
Judd as we look at
these areas down below.

00:04:45.402 --> 00:04:47.235 align:middle line:84%

00:04:47.235 --> 00:04:49.390 align:middle line:84%
and where has all
the rubble gone?

And have you been
able to-- is there

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.660 align:middle line:10%
any way you can
answer that question?

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.410 align:middle line:10%
-I'm sorry, Peter.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.730 align:middle line:10%
I didn't get the question.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.040 align:middle line:10%
-OK, I apologize.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.140 align:middle line:10%
Jackie Judd and
several other people

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.550 align:middle line:10%
keep asking us when you look at
where the towers used to stand,

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.890 align:middle line:10%
there is surprisingly
so little rubble.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.270 align:middle line:90%
Where did all the rubble go?

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.669 align:middle line:84%
-Well, it's a very
good question, Peter.

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And I have asked
some people who have

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.490 align:middle line:84%
been doing some of the rescue
and recovery work this morning.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.900 align:middle line:84%
If you look behind me, you
can see the very remains,

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.540 align:middle line:84%
the skeletal remains of
the World Trade Center.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.264 align:middle line:84%
And one volunteer,
Robert Galinsky,

00:05:23.264 --> 00:05:24.680 align:middle line:84%
explained to me
the reason there's

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.470 align:middle line:84%
so little rubble
is that all of it

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.863 align:middle line:84%
simply felt down into the ground
and was pulverized, evaporated.

so significant about what

00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:36.640 align:middle line:84%
just happened in
that conversation?

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: That they
were struggling

to determine what happened.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.287 align:middle line:84%
And poor George Stephanopoulos,
he's a reporter.

00:05:43.287 --> 00:05:45.620 align:middle line:84%
He's supposed to be telling
the world what he sees there

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.980 align:middle line:90%
and what's happening.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.304 align:middle line:84%
And how do you explain
where's the building?

00:05:50.304 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.495 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: It's nowhere to be seen.

00:05:52.495 --> 00:05:54.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, very
little debris left.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Not zero, but very
little debris.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.105 align:middle line:84%
And he was doing
the best he could.

00:05:58.105 --> 00:05:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
nonetheless, it was

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.271 align:middle line:84%
one of those spontaneous
conversations that

00:06:01.271 --> 00:06:02.360 align:middle line:90%
asked the question.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not as though
the question wasn't coming up.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.805 align:middle line:84%
I mean when I was
watching it, it

00:06:05.805 --> 00:06:07.510 align:middle line:84%
was what happened
to the buildings?

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.470 align:middle line:90%
Where's the debris?

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.720 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's right there.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.170 align:middle line:84%
It was obvious if you
were paying attention.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And I want to say
something about you

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.436 align:middle line:90%
first before we go any further.

00:06:15.436 --> 00:06:16.810 align:middle line:84%
I think it's
important to realize

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.790 align:middle line:84%
that Judy is very
highly-qualified to be talking

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.330 align:middle line:90%
about this subject.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Even though you're a
lone wolf out there

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.470 align:middle line:84%
in this world regarding 9/11
and have been very brave

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.020 align:middle line:90%
bringing your evidence forward.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.110 align:middle line:84%
But just to give
you an idea of Judy,

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm just grabbing a few
words from a bio about you.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Professor of
mechanical engineering,

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.150 align:middle line:84%
stress analysis,
structural mechanics,

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.970 align:middle line:90%
deformation analysis.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.440 align:middle line:84%
Expertise involves
interferometry

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.970 align:middle line:90%
and forensic science.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:84%
You've co-authored
over 60 peer reviewed

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.825 align:middle line:90%
papers in journal publications.

00:06:48.825 --> 00:06:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And it goes on and on about
complex material systems

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.880 align:middle line:84%
and optical and image
analysis methods.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.820 align:middle line:84%
So you're not doing
this blind, you

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.560 align:middle line:84%
were looking at this
from the first moment.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Observation.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Observation
as a scientist.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.419 align:middle line:84%
So when you first
saw these images,

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:09.710 align:middle line:84%
forget all the rest of what
was happening that morning,

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.610 align:middle line:84%
what was the first thing
that popped into your mind?

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: What's going on here?

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.560 align:middle line:84%
This building
looks like somebody

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.530 align:middle line:84%
pulled a yarn from a sweater and
just unraveled the whole thing.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Buildings don't
collapse like that.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Also a pancake
collapse, or kind that

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.770 align:middle line:84%
go boomity, boomity,
boomity, boom.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.570 align:middle line:90%
It's intervals.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.871 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't just all turn
to dust as a progression.

00:07:31.871 --> 00:07:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, that's where
we begin on this story, which

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.340 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the
lack of debris.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.571 align:middle line:84%
And do we have some images
that take a look at that?

00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:39.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yes.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.861 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's look
at the lack of debris.

00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And we've just talked
about it a bit.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Where did the towers go?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.375 align:middle line:84%
That's the title of your book,
"Where Did the Towers Go?"

00:07:46.375 --> 00:07:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Actually, it
was that conversation

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.478 align:middle line:84%
between Peter Jennings and
George Stephanopoulos that

00:07:49.478 --> 00:07:50.580 align:middle line:90%
inspired this title.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.670 align:middle line:84%
You know, where's
all the rubble?

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:53.695 align:middle line:90%
Where did it go?

00:07:53.695 --> 00:07:56.525 align:middle line:84%
And I was eager that
day, like yeah, I'm

00:07:56.525 --> 00:07:57.890 align:middle line:90%
glad somebody's asking that.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.790 align:middle line:10%
So we have this image
of before and after.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:07.200 align:middle line:10%
The little yellow box
on the bottom corner

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.600 align:middle line:10%
is all that's left
of the buildings.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.010 align:middle line:10%
And you've got to remember
what used to be there,

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.620 align:middle line:10%
these huge buildings.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.320 align:middle line:10%
And now they're gone and
just this little stub

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.020 align:middle line:10%
of a part of a building
is all that's left.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.520 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I mean that,
looking at it logically,

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.050 align:middle line:10%
there's a complete disconnect.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Having this official story
perpetrated on the public has,

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's done more
than just obscure facts.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.640 align:middle line:84%
It puts people in a direct
conflict with themselves

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.570 align:middle line:84%
and their own powers
of observation.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: When you're
told to see something--

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:50.420 align:middle line:84%
we're told collapse,
we're told pile.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a level debris field.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.007 align:middle line:84%
And what kind of
collapse was that?

00:08:55.007 --> 00:08:56.840 align:middle line:84%
It was already determined
it was a collapse,

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.298 align:middle line:84%
so people are told
it's a collapse,

00:08:58.298 --> 00:09:00.214 align:middle line:84%
so then they try to
see it as a collapse.

00:09:00.214 --> 00:09:00.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And again, giving the
conclusion before you study

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.310 align:middle line:84%
the problem is--
you never get there.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and it
deflects attention away

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.540 align:middle line:90%
from what actually happened.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And you know, right
after that, one

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:17.586 align:middle line:84%
of the videos that was making
its way around the internet

00:09:17.586 --> 00:09:18.960 align:middle line:84%
had to do with a
group of people,

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.090 align:middle line:84%
I think was basketball
players as I recall,

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and you were told
as a viewer to count

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:90%
how many passes of the ball.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.890 align:middle line:84%
So your attention was on
the passes of the ball,

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:33.410 align:middle line:84%
and in the end it revealed
that a gorilla had walked right

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.300 align:middle line:84%
through the middle of the scene
and we were so busy focusing

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.070 align:middle line:84%
on the ball and the
passes no one saw

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.150 align:middle line:84%
a gorilla walking
through the middle of it.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure many of
you have probably

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.100 align:middle line:90%
already seen that video.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.570 align:middle line:84%
That to me was one of the
most startling displays

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:51.250 align:middle line:84%
of how our attention can be
diverted to an absurd extent.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well,
what's a magic show?

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: You're told to look here
while the trickery is going on

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:56.664 align:middle line:90%
over here.

00:09:56.664 --> 00:09:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And it's
diverting attention.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.950 align:middle line:84%
So if attention gets
diverted away from something,

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.619 align:middle line:90%
you tend not to see it.

00:10:03.619 --> 00:10:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Now the story started
almost immediately,

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:09.030 align:middle line:84%
and one of the things-- one
of the stories that came out

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.030 align:middle line:84%
was about how this
debris had to be analyzed

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:17.750 align:middle line:84%
and was quickly
whisked away to China.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this happened
within a day to two days.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.857 align:middle line:84%
You would even argue that
it happened that day, right?

00:10:23.857 --> 00:10:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.340 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing there.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.860 align:middle line:84%
It was gone before noon,
if it was taken away.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.060 align:middle line:10%
Let's say on a nice
summer day, you

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.920 align:middle line:10%
go in to work across the
street from these towers.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.597 align:middle line:10%
And when you get
into your office,

00:10:36.597 --> 00:10:37.680 align:middle line:10%
what are you going to see?

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.870 align:middle line:10%
You're going to look
across the street.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.560 align:middle line:10%
Bankers Trust was directly
across from Tower Two.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.600 align:middle line:10%
And when you get
into your office

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:50.170 align:middle line:10%
and to look across the
street, there it is.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:50.856 align:middle line:90%
Where did it go?

00:10:50.856 --> 00:10:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.563 align:middle line:90%
Well, where are the beams?

00:10:52.563 --> 00:10:55.464 align:middle line:84%
I mean, supposedly we were
sending beams off to China.

00:10:55.464 --> 00:10:56.630 align:middle line:90%
That's what the report said.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.330 align:middle line:90%
But there are no beams.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:58.746 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It's down
at ground level.

00:10:58.746 --> 00:11:02.402 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing there except for
just a couple of outer walls.

00:11:02.402 --> 00:11:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you look out--
this is looking out

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:05.470 align:middle line:90%
of an air-conditioned office.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:05.850 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.070 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: The building
across the street,

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.070 align:middle line:10%
you're looking out of an
air-conditioned office,

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.680 align:middle line:10%
and it's still somewhat intact.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.040 align:middle line:10%
It was damaged, but
it was still intact.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you look the
other direction,

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.960 align:middle line:84%
you see most of
Building Four is gone.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and the reason
we bring this up is, again,

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.870 align:middle line:84%
this story was-- there
was a cover up story

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.420 align:middle line:84%
that was very carefully
orchestrated before this even

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:30.920 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.150 align:middle line:90%
It had to have been.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.810 align:middle line:84%
There are many anomalies having
to do with the media that day,

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:36.630 align:middle line:84%
some of which we'll
get to in a little bit.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.213 align:middle line:84%
But this whole thing
about the saying,

00:11:38.213 --> 00:11:40.870 align:middle line:84%
yes, we need to get the
debris out, go to China

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.540 align:middle line:84%
for, I don't know,
analysis or whatever.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.030 align:middle line:84%
When, in fact,
really there were no

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.207 align:middle line:84%
beams to send
anywhere at that time.

00:11:46.207 --> 00:11:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.347 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Virtually
nothing, right?

00:11:48.347 --> 00:11:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:52.130 align:middle line:84%
It was there in
that-- but that story

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:54.937 align:middle line:84%
kept you from seeing that
there was nothing much left.

00:11:54.937 --> 00:11:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.310 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Because that gave an
explanation for what it was.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.080 align:middle line:10%
Here's an image
of what was left.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.330 align:middle line:10%
And, you know,
another funny thing

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.620 align:middle line:10%
is we're told about
buildings collapsing.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.650 align:middle line:10%
That's One Liberty Plaza.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.070 align:middle line:10%
It was announced that
it was about to collapse

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:14.937 align:middle line:10%
or just collapsed
several times that day.

00:12:14.937 --> 00:12:15.770 align:middle line:10%
It's still standing.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:15.824 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:15.824 --> 00:12:16.490 align:middle line:10%
And it's still standing.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:17.281 align:middle line:10%
It never collapsed.

00:12:17.281 --> 00:12:21.530 align:middle line:10%
So I think a lot of
people have heard

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.950 align:middle line:10%
that there were these
inconsistencies, let's

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.860 align:middle line:10%
call them, in media
reports, but there's

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.020 align:middle line:10%
much more to that story.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:28.232 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:12:28.232 --> 00:12:29.648 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
going on that day,

00:12:29.648 --> 00:12:30.900 align:middle line:90%
nobody knew what was going on.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:31.790 align:middle line:84%
They were just doing
the best they could

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.080 align:middle line:90%
with the information they had.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.704 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
they were being fed.

00:12:34.704 --> 00:12:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And then-- as we
were being fed it.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.610 align:middle line:84%
We started buying into
the story as well.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.617 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, we had the face
of the perpetrator up there.

00:12:42.617 --> 00:12:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.710 align:middle line:90%
And then we started having--

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: The bad guy.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Get your pitchfork,
go get the witch.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's right,
go get the witch.

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.460 align:middle line:84%
So we're not going to
get into any of that

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.622 align:middle line:90%
because we don't need to.

00:12:50.622 --> 00:12:52.580 align:middle line:84%
We really need to stick
with the evidence here.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.152 align:middle line:90%
And so now--

00:12:53.152 --> 00:12:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, here's
what was left.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:13:00.260 align:middle line:10%
And if you get down and
look from ground level here,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.790 align:middle line:10%
we're going to look at that
view standing right down

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:04.487 align:middle line:10%
there in front of Tower One.

00:13:04.487 --> 00:13:06.070 align:middle line:84%
There was an ambulance
that was parked

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.270 align:middle line:84%
there right in
front of Tower One.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.000 align:middle line:90%
The ambulance was still there.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't look like it
was clobbered even.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's the outer walls, the
North and South wall, maybe six

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:18.850 align:middle line:90%
or eight stores worth.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:20.525 align:middle line:84%
That is it of a
110 story building.

00:13:20.525 --> 00:13:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:22.300 align:middle line:90%
No, it doesn't make sense.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: This picture was
approximately around midday

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.310 align:middle line:90%
on 9/11.

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:30.030 align:middle line:84%
How could they have
sent that all to China?

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:31.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:31.810 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Not possible to send
it all to China,

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.260 align:middle line:84%
if there was anything
to begin with.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Not possible, would
never happen in any kind

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.930 align:middle line:84%
of normal situation
of devastation.

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
bathtub, and tell us

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.040 align:middle line:90%
what the bathtub is.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
speaking about this

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.990 align:middle line:84%
is because if you have a
building that is collapsing,

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.960 align:middle line:84%
it will have a seismic
impact on that area

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.565 align:middle line:90%
and be measured, right?

00:13:53.565 --> 00:13:54.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Well, not just that.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:14:02.020 align:middle line:84%
But you know, when it
slams down to the ground--

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.790 align:middle line:84%
the towers were built on bedrock
70 feet below the water table.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:09.165 align:middle line:84%
They were built in the Hudson
River with a dike around them.

00:14:09.165 --> 00:14:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you're slamming
two 500,000 ton buildings

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:17.705 align:middle line:84%
down onto this dike, it's
going to be busted somehow.

00:14:17.705 --> 00:14:19.730 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
cracked, damaged.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And all the subway tunnels
that open up into the bathtub,

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.290 align:middle line:84%
lower Manhattan
would be flooded.

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: And that didn't happen.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, also if it slammed down,
the people in Stairwell B

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:35.740 align:middle line:90%
would've been crushed.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's all that was left.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you looked
up and saw blue sky.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:42.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And why
weren't they crushed?

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Out of 110 stories,
106 stories above them

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.590 align:middle line:84%
went away and didn't crush
them and they walked out.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:54.165 align:middle line:84%
14 people survived
there and walked out.

00:14:54.165 --> 00:14:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which they
shouldn't have, theoretically.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:01.590 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about those
graphs, which you also

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:04.030 align:middle line:10%
have in your book,
I've seen them,

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:10.490 align:middle line:10%
and about the complete lack
of a signature of any noise

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:14.390 align:middle line:10%
or any earth disturbing
types of activity.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.300 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Up above
at the top, there's

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:20.070 align:middle line:10%
WTC One's impact on the ground.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:23.340 align:middle line:10%
And what's below
that, that blue data,

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.730 align:middle line:10%
that was an earthquake that
was in midtown Manhattan

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:26.370 align:middle line:10%
that same year.

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:30.350 align:middle line:10%
It's approximately
the same magnitude.

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:34.040 align:middle line:10%
And it was a 2.4
instead of a 2.3.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.280 align:middle line:10%
But you notice the signals
are very, very different.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.910 align:middle line:10%
Notice the high frequency
in the blue signal.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:40.750 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.670 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: But notice
that you first

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:46.050 align:middle line:10%
get the primary wave arriving,
that little it's kind

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:48.080 align:middle line:10%
of like snout leading
up to the big wave.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.680 align:middle line:10%
And then the secondary
wave is that bigger one.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.060 align:middle line:10%
And the timing between
those two tells you

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.610 align:middle line:10%
how far away the epicenter is.

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.520 align:middle line:10%
Those two signals travel
through the Earth,

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.970 align:middle line:10%
but travel at different speeds.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:02.250 align:middle line:10%
That's how come they're
different arrival times.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.870 align:middle line:10%
But you can't see
those same signals

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.470 align:middle line:10%
from when the towers hit.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:10.494 align:middle line:10%
If the towers are slamming
down into bedrock,

00:16:10.494 --> 00:16:11.910 align:middle line:10%
shouldn't you be
getting a signal?

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.660 align:middle line:84%
They should be ringing
like a tuning fork.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: And it did not.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Right, here is the
signal for Tower One.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.430 align:middle line:90%
It lasted eight seconds.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.120 align:middle line:84%
It takes 9 and 1/2 seconds
to throw a bowling ball

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.180 align:middle line:84%
off the roof and have
it hit the ground below.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.732 align:middle line:90%
The ground shook for less time.

00:16:29.732 --> 00:16:31.190 align:middle line:84%
The building didn't
hit the ground.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:32.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Than freefall speed.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.849 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:16:33.849 --> 00:16:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: The building
went away faster

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.814 align:middle line:90%
than it could have fallen.

00:16:36.814 --> 00:16:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It didn't
hit the ground,

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:39.516 align:middle line:90%
didn't slam into the ground.

00:16:39.516 --> 00:16:41.700 align:middle line:84%
That's why there's
no S and P waves.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.637 align:middle line:90%
There's only surface waves.

00:16:43.637 --> 00:16:44.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.595 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And that's
what you would

00:16:45.595 --> 00:16:48.550 align:middle line:84%
get if you lifted the
building off the ground.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Think of two people sleeping
together in the same bed.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.040 align:middle line:84%
One person gets up,
the other person--

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.950 align:middle line:84%
on a conventional
mattress, the other person

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:56.914 align:middle line:90%
feels the disturbance.

00:16:56.914 --> 00:16:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: If you lift a 500,000
ton building off the ground,

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.470 align:middle line:84%
it's going to cause a
surface disturbance.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:03.136 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:03.136 --> 00:17:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: That's all
that was recorded.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Not anything going
boom on the bedrock.

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.089 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now was any
of this brought up

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:16.329 align:middle line:84%
when they did the big
investigative report on 9/11?

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:18.829 align:middle line:84%
Did they look into any
of this activity at all?

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They didn't
investigate the collapse.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.180 align:middle line:84%
They investigated a
hypothetical situation.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.560 align:middle line:84%
They investigated up
until before the buildings

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.930 align:middle line:90%
came apart.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:33.020 align:middle line:84%
When I filed a request
for correction with them,

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:37.410 align:middle line:84%
I said your explanation does not
abide by the laws of physics.

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh, it doesn't
violate the laws of physics

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.910 align:middle line:84%
because the building
was standing

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.550 align:middle line:84%
as long as it was
still standing,

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.080 align:middle line:84%
It was obeying the
laws of physics.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.520 align:middle line:84%
They didn't investigate
the collapse.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Instead, what they did is bring
about a hypothetical situation

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.630 align:middle line:90%
and just talk about that.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And so it wasn't the
actual event itself

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:55.910 align:middle line:90%
that was discussed.

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:58.044 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you first have
to look at what happened.

00:17:58.044 --> 00:17:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And they didn't
do that first step.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.870 align:middle line:84%
If you assume what
happened and then go on,

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.344 align:middle line:90%
you never get to the answer.

00:18:06.344 --> 00:18:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: So they
couldn't get there

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.540 align:middle line:90%
from where they started from.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But then at the
same time, rather quickly,

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:15.840 align:middle line:84%
another movement
started sprouting up

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.980 align:middle line:84%
where architects had joined
together, a Truth for 9/11,

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:24.140 align:middle line:84%
saying that this was a
controlled demolition.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's not where you're
going with this either.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.340 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they've had
problems with you

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.789 align:middle line:90%
bringing this evidence--

00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Because I--

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: -to the table.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I deal
with the evidence.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.160 align:middle line:90%
Nobody can refute the evidence.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.411 align:middle line:90%
The evidence is the truth.

00:18:36.411 --> 00:18:38.160 align:middle line:84%
As I say, the evidence
is the truth theory

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.680 align:middle line:84%
must mimic That's actually a
quote from a famous person,

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.180 align:middle line:90%
but--

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Theory must mimic.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:43.760 align:middle line:90%
That's a very good quote.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.301 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:18:44.301 --> 00:18:46.070 align:middle line:84%
You have to start
with the evidence.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.680 align:middle line:90%
Empirical evidence is the truth.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what is the hole
in the controlled demolition

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.430 align:middle line:90%
story then?

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.075 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what are the holes?

00:18:53.075 --> 00:18:56.247 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, if you start out
and say this is what did it,

00:18:56.247 --> 00:18:57.330 align:middle line:90%
you know, thermite did it.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:58.240 align:middle line:90%
What's it?

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.125 align:middle line:90%
They haven't defined what it is.

00:19:00.125 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:84%
You have to first
define what it is.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And, for example, if you're
blowing up the building,

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.415 align:middle line:84%
why doesn't the seismic
chart show that?

00:19:10.415 --> 00:19:13.670 align:middle line:84%
There's no-- like
especially Building Seven,

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:19.030 align:middle line:84%
and you can see in this chart
the very last row down there,

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:24.760 align:middle line:84%
the cluster of anomalies you
see is earthquakes in the Fox

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Islands, in the
Aleutian Islands.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.519 align:middle line:84%
But there's basically no seismic
event for Building Seven.

00:19:30.519 --> 00:19:32.060 align:middle line:84%
If a building slammed
to the ground--

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:35.770 align:middle line:84%
it's a 47 story building,
if it slammed to the ground,

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.460 align:middle line:84%
it it should have
shaken the earth.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.410 align:middle line:84%
To say nothing of the
absurdity of what was going on

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:46.360 align:middle line:84%
at that time when Larry
Silverstein was saying,

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.210 align:middle line:84%
yeah, everything gone on, we
have to pull the building.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:50.880 align:middle line:90%
And that--

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:51.220 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Well, that came--

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -it was
a total disconnect.

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:52.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: -a year later.

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it was a
total disconnect, though,

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.493 align:middle line:90%
for him to say that.

00:19:55.493 --> 00:19:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Why would you pull a building
because of surrounding events?

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:01.880 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you can't
pull a building quickly.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Do firefighters
fight fires

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:05.150 align:middle line:84%
with sticks of dynamite in
their back pocket, just in case?

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.350 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:09.340 align:middle line:84%
So this whole notion of pulling
a building was patently absurd.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And you notice in
this conversation

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:13.586 align:middle line:84%
we're not talking at
all about airplanes.

00:20:13.586 --> 00:20:14.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:15.961 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're not
talking about airplanes

00:20:15.961 --> 00:20:17.030 align:middle line:90%
going into a building.

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, we
should probably talk

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.386 align:middle line:84%
about the Pentagon
at this time as well.

00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And we're not talking
about it because you're

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:26.160 align:middle line:84%
saying it's absolutely
scientifically

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.710 align:middle line:84%
impossible that even
with airplanes flying

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:31.980 align:middle line:84%
into buildings, this
kind of devastation

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:32.814 align:middle line:90%
could have occurred.

00:20:32.814 --> 00:20:35.104 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: If you start out with
looking at what happened,

00:20:35.104 --> 00:20:37.080 align:middle line:84%
what happened is the
buildings did not burn up,

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.840 align:middle line:84%
nor did they slam to the ground,
but they turned into dust

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.260 align:middle line:90%
in midair.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:43.040 align:middle line:90%
Airplanes can't do that.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Real airplanes can't do that,
and neither can fake airplanes.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.080 align:middle line:90%
So airplanes are a non-issue.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I'm just
saying that because that's

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.993 align:middle line:84%
why we're not bringing
it up, because that's

00:20:52.993 --> 00:20:54.920 align:middle line:84%
the only theory that
absolutely has no legs.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.890 align:middle line:84%
You can't even find anything
to stick around that one.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Well, none of it has.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.800 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't deal
with the evidence.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And so you have to
start with the evidence.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the
evidence is the truth.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And whatever theory
you're going to come up

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.900 align:middle line:84%
with better incorporate
all the evidence.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And so, I don't
even look at theory.

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:14.634 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to have a theory
if you have the evidence.

00:21:14.634 --> 00:21:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.885 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: The evidence
tells you what happened.

00:21:16.885 --> 00:21:18.426 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It will
tell you the story.

00:21:18.426 --> 00:21:21.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, now again, when
we're talking about some

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:23.970 align:middle line:84%
of the other theories,
one of the things

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.540 align:middle line:84%
that came up in the notion
of the controlled demolition

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:30.010 align:middle line:84%
was that there were
explosion sounds that

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.180 align:middle line:84%
were happening from
the basement up.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.981 align:middle line:84%
And you have a
different explanation

00:21:33.981 --> 00:21:35.230 align:middle line:90%
for what that might have been.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.510 align:middle line:84%
It didn't mean it was a
detonation device necessarily,

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:38.010 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well,
people heard booms.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.182 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:41.182 --> 00:21:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Bombs go boom,
but not everything

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:44.480 align:middle line:90%
that goes boom is a bomb.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So just because somebody heard
a boom doesn't mean a bomb.

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Think of your egg in
your microwave oven.

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:52.320 align:middle line:84%
It goes boom, but it doesn't
mean you put a bomb in there.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.986 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what do
you say those booms

00:21:53.986 --> 00:21:57.610 align:middle line:84%
where that the firemen
stated they heard?

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, some
of the firemen even

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.690 align:middle line:84%
commented that they
saw the Scott tanks.

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:04.410 align:middle line:84%
That's the oxygen
tanks or the air tanks

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:07.210 align:middle line:84%
that the firefighters wear so
they can breathe clean air when

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:08.680 align:middle line:90%
they're fighting fires.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.190 align:middle line:84%
They have extra tanks
on their fire truck.

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:12.829 align:middle line:84%
They were exploding
at ground level.

00:22:12.829 --> 00:22:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They were
exploding outside

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:15.990 align:middle line:90%
of the building on the trucks.

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:18.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Outside the
building at ground level.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And you think about it, if the
building is turning into dust,

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:84%
if steel's turning to dust,
if something's degrading,

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:28.190 align:middle line:84%
it's got to get to a certain
point on a pressure vessel

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:31.830 align:middle line:84%
where it can no longer
hold the pressure in.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And think of all the water
tanks in the building.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:36.420 align:middle line:84%
They can't pump
water all the way up.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.970 align:middle line:84%
They have to pump it in
stages, because otherwise it

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:40.220 align:middle line:90%
would all drain down.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.196 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: But think of
those water tanks.

00:22:43.196 --> 00:22:44.820 align:middle line:84%
When they had gotten
to the point where

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.020 align:middle line:84%
they could no longer
hold the pressure,

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.320 align:middle line:90%
they're going to burst.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And so you'd expect to see
squirts of water shooting

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:53.370 align:middle line:84%
out of the building
every so many floors.

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:84%
So, again, that suggestion
when people start out

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.620 align:middle line:84%
assuming that this
is bombs, then that's

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.000 align:middle line:84%
what they're looking
for rather than

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.370 align:middle line:84%
what is the evidence
telling you.

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet, you're
saying that this is essentially

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.560 align:middle line:84%
an energy directed
weapon, right?

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It's energy
that is directed.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.031 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Directed.

00:23:14.031 --> 00:23:15.320 align:middle line:90%
And used as a weapon.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:20.537 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, we're not
necessarily talking heat here.

00:23:20.537 --> 00:23:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.490 align:middle line:90%
Heat is a kinetic energy.

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And we can rule out heat, we
can rule out a projectile,

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.650 align:middle line:84%
you know, like a
missile or something

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:36.290 align:middle line:84%
flying through space and hitting
something else, or like bombs.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Those are kinetic
energy devices.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.007 align:middle line:84%
And so it has to
be something else.

00:23:41.007 --> 00:23:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one of the
pieces of evidence, which

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:45.700 align:middle line:84%
we don't have in a slide here
but you can maybe just talk

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.640 align:middle line:84%
about a little bit-- you have
it in your files somewhere,

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.230 align:middle line:84%
but we're not using
it today, and that

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:53.560 align:middle line:84%
is the patterns in which the
windows were blowing out.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.810 align:middle line:84%
For example, it
wasn't a normal blow.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.960 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't just a
shattering from the inside.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.460 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Oh, it was
just round holes.

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.320 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Little round
holes in the windows.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.350 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: And sometimes
only in the outer pane,

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.070 align:middle line:10%
not both panes of window.

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.410 align:middle line:10%
And glass is a brittle material.

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:11.070 align:middle line:10%
How it breaks when you throw
a rock or a baseball at it,

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:12.730 align:middle line:10%
it bends the window.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.910 align:middle line:10%
And because it's a brittle
material, it's weak in tension.

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:19.940 align:middle line:84%
So when you bend it, the
outer surface is in tension

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.627 align:middle line:90%
and it fractures there.

00:24:21.627 --> 00:24:22.585 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And instead--

00:24:22.585 --> 00:24:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: And it propagates.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what would
account for having

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:29.250 align:middle line:90%
little holes blasted out?

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:31.500 align:middle line:90%
Circular holes blasted out.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Longitudinal
waves do that.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:34.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: For reproducing
all these effects in a lab,

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.685 align:middle line:90%
I would use longitudinal waves.

00:24:39.685 --> 00:24:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Longitudinal waves.

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, these
effects were reproduced.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: These are energy waves.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:44.763 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:44.763 --> 00:24:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And these effects were
reproduced in a lab

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:47.840 align:middle line:90%
and much more.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
evidence you have

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:51.900 align:middle line:84%
regarding the lack
of heat, but what

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.837 align:middle line:84%
appears to be almost heat-type
damage is really astounding.

00:24:55.837 --> 00:24:57.670 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get to
that in just a minute.

00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:59.790 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about toasted cars.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:02.200 align:middle line:84%
We need to eventually
talk about the people that

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.410 align:middle line:84%
were involved also, which
is a very difficult part

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:08.720 align:middle line:84%
to talk about, but we need to
because the evidence really

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.560 align:middle line:90%
speaks for itself.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.160 align:middle line:84%
So we'll be back
in just a moment.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:18.640 align:middle line:90%


00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We are back with more
astounding evidence and visuals

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.240 align:middle line:84%
that you have
managed to compile,

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.520 align:middle line:84%
showing that this was nothing
like what the media's told us.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.730 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about
buildings dustifying.

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:31.890 align:middle line:10%
Let's go to this image
we have right now.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:35.850 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: Imagine you're on
the 100th or 110th floor

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:38.890 align:middle line:10%
at the restaurant, and you
cover yourself with flour

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:40.760 align:middle line:10%
and jump out the window.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.080 align:middle line:10%
Is the person on
ground level going

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.162 align:middle line:10%
to see much dust
coming off of you?

00:25:45.162 --> 00:25:46.870 align:middle line:10%
No, it's going to be
blown off instantly.

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:47.760 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Blown off, yeah.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:50.280 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: OK, let's say you take
a couple of armloads of flour

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.290 align:middle line:10%
and eject them as
you're jumping out.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:54.500 align:middle line:10%
Are they going to
see much of this?

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.540 align:middle line:10%
How much extra flour
or dust or whatever

00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:00.960 align:middle line:10%
do you need to carry to be able
to heave off opaque levels?

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.411 align:middle line:10%
This is opaque, you can't
see light through it.

00:26:03.411 --> 00:26:04.910 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, and
you've been very

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:10.480 align:middle line:10%
clear in saying when people
use words like evaporation

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.827 align:middle line:10%
and so forth, you're saying
no, it's not evaporation.

00:26:12.827 --> 00:26:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: That implies heat.

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:15.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That implies heat.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.840 align:middle line:90%
It's none of the above.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.256 align:middle line:90%
It implies--

00:26:18.256 --> 00:26:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: It's becoming dust.

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Becoming-- it's
disappearing before our eyes.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.487 align:middle line:90%
It's dematerializing almost.

00:26:23.487 --> 00:26:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:25.945 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean just
shy of dematerializing.

00:26:25.945 --> 00:26:29.332 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: We need a new word
for it, dustification.

00:26:29.332 --> 00:26:31.290 align:middle line:10%
We haven't seen a building
turn to dust before,

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:34.060 align:middle line:10%
and this is clearly turning
to dust as it falls.

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:39.440 align:middle line:10%
Not only that, when
this comes down further,

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.300 align:middle line:10%
you can see the parts
of it dissolving.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And we can look at the
intersection below that

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:47.330 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see that people
come out of their hiding places

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:48.800 align:middle line:90%
and the building's gone.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:49.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.430 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they're commenting
where did the building go?

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Like you say, the people
that were in Stairwell B, one

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.120 align:middle line:84%
of the men commented looking
up, where's the building,

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.380 align:middle line:90%
and they were looking at sky.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It was blue sky, and
where did the building go?

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When,
theoretically in a pancake,

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.830 align:middle line:84%
if it were a
controlled demolition,

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:06.627 align:middle line:90%
they should've been crushed.

00:27:06.627 --> 00:27:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything inside
would have been crushed.

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: In this
image, they'd just

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:12.700 align:middle line:90%
came out of their hiding places.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:16.890 align:middle line:84%
That's the intersection where
those steel beams were falling

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:19.760 align:middle line:84%
towards, that were turning
to dust, they didn't land.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.410 align:middle line:84%
They became dust
before they landed.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And there's a hole
in the sky there

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.050 align:middle line:90%
where you can't see a building.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now another
thing they talked about

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:31.770 align:middle line:84%
in coming out of Building
Four, one of the people

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:36.776 align:middle line:84%
commented that there was almost
a strange tornado effect.

00:27:36.776 --> 00:27:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Yeah, it
sounded like a tornado.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.146 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:39.146 --> 00:27:41.664 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They're describing
various experiences.

00:27:41.664 --> 00:27:43.080 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like a
bangity, bangity,

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.890 align:middle line:84%
crunch of a building
collapsing above.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:45.390 align:middle line:90%
It was--

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:46.806 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Weren't
things levitated

00:27:46.806 --> 00:27:50.460 align:middle line:84%
and then simply something
just landed upside down?

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And elsewhere, there
were some things

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:55.710 align:middle line:84%
that just seemed to be caught
up almost as in a tornado

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:56.887 align:middle line:90%
and just landed somewhere.

00:27:56.887 --> 00:27:57.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:00.960 align:middle line:84%
There was an EMT who was
carried down the stairs.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, you're
trying to put it together

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:05.460 align:middle line:84%
with your life's
experience, and how could

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.480 align:middle line:84%
she explain how she
levitated down the stairs,

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.520 align:middle line:84%
so she decided
she must have died

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and God carried her
down the stairs.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Because how else could she
have gotten down the stairs?

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have to find some
known context for it, right?

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.770 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have
this kind of context,

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:22.310 align:middle line:84%
where one guy dove underneath
an emergency vehicle.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:24.060 align:middle line:90%
I think it was Michael Macko.

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And one of the towers
was coming apart

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and dove under an
emergency vehicle

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.190 align:middle line:90%
and then everything went black.

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:32.660 align:middle line:84%
When the sunlight
finally shone through,

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.180 align:middle line:84%
the vehicle was not
above him anymore.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.200 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't remember
it being blown off

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.450 align:middle line:90%
or rolling off or lifting off.

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:39.680 align:middle line:90%
It was just gone.

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well you
can see if we are not

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.990 align:middle line:84%
studied in this particular
technology, how the brain has

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:49.400 align:middle line:84%
to scramble to try to
put pieces together

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.390 align:middle line:84%
to make some sense
of it, so you would

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:54.040 align:middle line:84%
have had some awfully strange
testimony coming right

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.760 align:middle line:90%
after the event I would imagine.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Oh, yeah.

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:56.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And some of the first
responders have contacted me

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:01.580 align:middle line:84%
since because
they've read my book,

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:05.010 align:middle line:84%
and it's given them so
much relief because that's

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:07.550 align:middle line:84%
what they thought they saw,
but who'd ever believe them?

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:11.152 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And that part
is part of the torment.

00:29:11.152 --> 00:29:13.610 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the reasons why
people have trouble seeing what

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:17.160 align:middle line:84%
happened because
if they're alone,

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.350 align:middle line:84%
it's very uncomfortable
to go off on your own.

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:21.680 align:middle line:90%
You tend to go with the herd.

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:24.476 align:middle line:84%
Probably it's
instinctive for survival.

00:29:24.476 --> 00:29:26.600 align:middle line:84%
But that's one of the things
that also keeps people

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.040 align:middle line:90%
from seeing what's going on.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like no, it can't be
because that's not normal.

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Well this book is just
packed with images

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:38.910 align:middle line:84%
that really make you feel almost
ignorant if you didn't already

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:42.970 align:middle line:84%
have kind of an inkling that
something else had transpired.

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:44.630 align:middle line:90%
Each page is a revelation.

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:47.260 align:middle line:84%
You go through it and think,
how did I not see that?

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.835 align:middle line:84%
How come no one
reported on that?

00:29:48.835 --> 00:29:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Because you
weren't told to see it.

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:50.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:52.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and that's how
I'm sure most people that

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.970 align:middle line:84%
go through the
book feel about it.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
I think many of us

00:29:56.090 --> 00:30:01.640 align:middle line:84%
found very intriguing was the
notion of the toasted cars.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.870 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about burnt
cars, there was no heat.

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:06.740 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
about toasted cars,

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.530 align:middle line:90%
which is a different process.

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: This is a car that
was found on FDR Drive.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it got
toasted there or not.

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.010 align:middle line:84%
There were vehicles
there that we're

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:17.060 align:middle line:84%
seeing the first
responder-- talk

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.785 align:middle line:84%
about people needing
to explain things.

00:30:18.785 --> 00:30:21.970 align:middle line:84%
The first responders saw the car
go into spontaneous combustion

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:25.209 align:middle line:84%
and assumed that there must
have been a fireball that

00:30:25.209 --> 00:30:27.000 align:middle line:84%
rolled down the street
and hit the vehicle,

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.416 align:middle line:84%
because why else would it have
suddenly burst into flames?

00:30:29.416 --> 00:30:32.317 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's talk
about where that location is.

00:30:32.317 --> 00:30:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It's on the
other side of Manhattan.

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:34.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:36.380 align:middle line:84%
So how many blocks
are we talking about?

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Oh, seven blocks or so.

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: These vehicles
are seven blocks away

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:42.360 align:middle line:90%
from the towers?

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: The ones that this
first responder witnessed.

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:48.700 align:middle line:84%
These may have been
towed there, maybe not.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about
this particular one.

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:50.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't know which--

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:51.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: -one this fellow saw.

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.887 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But seven blocks
away, there were cars.

00:30:53.887 --> 00:30:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And these particular-- the
damage pattern on these though,

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.350 align:middle line:90%
is what is so intriguing.

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.960 align:middle line:84%
This one, you see
on one side of it,

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.460 align:middle line:84%
the front end is
completely toasted.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.060 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by toasted is
it's toast, it's history.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.600 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
happened to it.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.360 align:middle line:84%
Don't want to say burnt because
that's making an assumption.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:15.340 align:middle line:84%
When you call it something,
you bias your observation.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.960 align:middle line:90%
You assume it's burnt.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And this could have been
something entirely different.

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.539 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example, look
at the lights on the top.

00:31:21.539 --> 00:31:22.330 align:middle line:90%
They're not melted.

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:23.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Intact.

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: They're not
melted, so could there

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:26.350 align:middle line:90%
have been heat involved?

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.185 align:middle line:84%
And why did it abruptly
stop at the door?

00:31:28.185 --> 00:31:29.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why did it?

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:33.427 align:middle line:84%
How can-- again, is this the
longitudinal wave patterns

00:31:33.427 --> 00:31:35.010 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about,
or what is this?

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Well, it's
important to just observe.

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:39.140 align:middle line:84%
But one thing we
do know about this

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.490 align:middle line:84%
is that you have rubber
gaskets around the door.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:45.410 align:middle line:10%
Maybe there's some
electrical component to it.

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.310 align:middle line:10%
And on the other side, yet you
notice that the gas tank is

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.240 align:middle line:10%
intact and the tires
are intact there

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.390 align:middle line:10%
and you have this
circular spot, it's

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:56.451 align:middle line:10%
almost like it was
photographically masked off.

00:31:56.451 --> 00:31:56.950 align:middle line:10%
Ah-ha!

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:59.540 align:middle line:10%
You start thinking of
energy interference

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:01.675 align:middle line:10%
and why you get something
abruptly happening

00:32:01.675 --> 00:32:03.490 align:middle line:10%
in one place and not another.

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:06.002 align:middle line:10%
Fire does not have
an abrupt stop like.

00:32:06.002 --> 00:32:08.210 align:middle line:10%
You have black, white, and
shades of gray in between.

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:09.080 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.470 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: But to have an
abrupt thing, it's usually

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.857 align:middle line:10%
some kind of energy
interfering that does that.

00:32:14.857 --> 00:32:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are we
looking at here on this bus?

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: This is
on West Broadway.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.439 align:middle line:90%
This bus got toasted.

00:32:20.439 --> 00:32:21.480 align:middle line:90%
Something happened to it.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.396 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How far is
West Broadway from there?

00:32:23.396 --> 00:32:25.439 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It's just
north of the complex.

00:32:25.439 --> 00:32:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: You can see Building
Seven off in the distance.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:29.728 align:middle line:84%
But what is
interesting is, can you

00:32:29.728 --> 00:32:32.069 align:middle line:84%
find any scorch
marks on this bus?

00:32:32.069 --> 00:32:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:33.250 align:middle line:90%
Not really.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:36.942 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Where did the
flames happen from?

00:32:36.942 --> 00:32:38.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did anyone
witness flames

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.500 align:middle line:90%
coming out of most of these?

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.800 align:middle line:84%
You said that first
one, they saw--

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Or it
appears like flames.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It appears
to be flames.

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.105 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: But you see also
flames coming out of paper

00:32:45.105 --> 00:32:46.610 align:middle line:90%
while the paper's not burning.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now that
was interesting.

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:52.250 align:middle line:84%
When I looked at that picture,
you're talking about one

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:54.370 align:middle line:84%
of the things recovered
was a compressed filing

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:55.870 align:middle line:90%
cabinet, right?

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:57.120 align:middle line:90%
From Ben and Jerry's?

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in it,
you see this metal,

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.085 align:middle line:84%
which has been compressed
down into a ball.

00:33:04.085 --> 00:33:05.611 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: With colored paper.

00:33:05.611 --> 00:33:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Colored paper.

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:08.390 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't it even dollar bills?

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:10.415 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: That was a
blue and a red divider.

00:33:10.415 --> 00:33:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:13.186 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: But the money, there
was like $20 bills that

00:33:13.186 --> 00:33:15.019 align:middle line:84%
were in there, and they
were able to call up

00:33:15.019 --> 00:33:18.000 align:middle line:84%
the owner of Ben and Jerry's and
say, here, come get your money.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you have
totally intact money sticking

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:25.380 align:middle line:84%
out, corners sticking out, of
a completely compressed ball

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.830 align:middle line:90%
of metal.

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:27.516 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:33:27.516 --> 00:33:28.330 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So again,
how does that work?

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:33.970 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: It wasn't
crushed by being smashed.

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:34.950 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't burned up.

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:35.810 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't melted.

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:37.950 align:middle line:10%
It was-- something
else happened to it.

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:42.199 align:middle line:10%
If we resist the temptation
to make assumptions and just

00:33:42.199 --> 00:33:44.240 align:middle line:10%
look at what the evidence
is, something did this,

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:44.850 align:middle line:10%
we know that.

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:46.710 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Something
compressed it.

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Or caused
it to crinkle up.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: And to shrivel up.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.766 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wouldn't
that necessarily mean

00:33:52.766 --> 00:33:55.750 align:middle line:84%
you have to have an
altered atomic structure

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:57.270 align:middle line:90%
of these materials?

00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:58.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yes.

00:33:58.010 --> 00:33:59.165 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:59.165 --> 00:34:02.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, plastic when you put
in near a flame, near heat,

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.225 align:middle line:90%
it tends to change.

00:34:04.225 --> 00:34:07.840 align:middle line:84%
You know how it shrivels
up and crinkles up.

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.270 align:middle line:84%
So that's heat
changing something.

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:13.570 align:middle line:84%
This is some other form
of energy changing it.

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:17.723 align:middle line:84%
So energy was manipulated
in this material.

00:34:17.723 --> 00:34:20.139 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're also talking
about something else that

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:24.020 align:middle line:84%
was intriguing and that is the
boots, the steel-toed boots.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think we have
imagery for this right here.

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:27.095 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:34:27.095 --> 00:34:28.345 align:middle line:90%
There is-- well, it's a video.

00:34:28.345 --> 00:34:28.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you have
something in here?

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:29.434 align:middle line:90%
A little video?

00:34:29.434 --> 00:34:30.100 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: A video.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:32.420 align:middle line:84%
But here's a bunch
of the toasted cars.

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.940 align:middle line:84%
The difference between
the toasted cars of 9/11

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:40.630 align:middle line:84%
and of fire damage, the lower
left hand corner is from 9/11.

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:45.489 align:middle line:84%
Notice that the lip that you
put the windshield on that it

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:49.060 align:middle line:90%
seats into is completely clean.

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And the car looks like it
was almost sandblasted,

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:53.820 align:middle line:90%
ready for a new paint job.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:55.900 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have
black scorch marks,

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:59.412 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have a bunch of broken
glass left in the corners.

00:34:59.412 --> 00:35:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again,
that's a hallmark.

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:01.953 align:middle line:90%
There are no scorch marks.

00:35:01.953 --> 00:35:04.100 align:middle line:90%
There are no marks of fire.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right, right.

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a different type of thing.

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Here's another set where
the inside of a burnt car

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.435 align:middle line:84%
is there's a lot
of stuff left over,

00:35:14.435 --> 00:35:16.300 align:middle line:90%
you know, half burnt inside.

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:21.120 align:middle line:84%
But the toasted cars from
9/11 is absolutely nothing

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:24.480 align:middle line:84%
left inside, except maybe trash
that somebody later tossed in.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, it's like in
another parlance, evaporated.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.440 align:middle line:90%
It simply disappeared.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:29.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.232 align:middle line:90%
Just gone.

00:35:31.232 --> 00:35:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's talk
about, if you don't mind,

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.432 align:middle line:84%
can we talk about the
metal boots for a bit?

00:35:35.432 --> 00:35:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Oh, yeah.

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
that's interesting.

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:37.886 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: It's another--

00:35:37.886 --> 00:35:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Metal-toed--
metal-toed boots

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.100 align:middle line:90%
for some of the workers there.

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:41.683 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:35:41.683 --> 00:35:46.860 align:middle line:10%
It's another story that came
up like all steel shipped

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.050 align:middle line:10%
to China.

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:50.290 align:middle line:10%
We heard this story about
the steel-toed boots

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:53.250 align:middle line:10%
were melting because it
was so hot out there.

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:55.950 align:middle line:10%
But-- and it was they'd melt.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:58.940 align:middle line:10%
It was over 1,000 degrees
is what they said,

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:02.990 align:middle line:10%
and they would melt after
just a couple hours.

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:06.472 align:middle line:84%
If your steel oven
was melting, don't you

00:36:06.472 --> 00:36:08.680 align:middle line:84%
think the turkey inside
would be more than well done?

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:09.305 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:09.305 --> 00:36:10.140 align:middle line:90%
You would think.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:13.370 align:middle line:84%
But there's no
reports of burnt feet.

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And 1,000 degrees,
if you're walking

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:19.170 align:middle line:84%
on a grill-- your
barbecue grill,

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:20.599 align:middle line:90%
that's not even 1,000 degrees.

00:36:20.599 --> 00:36:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it doesn't.

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.077 align:middle line:84%
It's over a couple thousand
to melt steel, isn't it?

00:36:24.077 --> 00:36:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:29.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like 2,700 degrees
Fahrenheit, or 1535 centigrade.

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:30.890 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:33.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yet, there's evidence
that the steel-toed boots

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.350 align:middle line:90%
were melting.

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Or disintegrated.

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Disintegrating.

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Melting by heat.

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:38.347 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the
toes weren't burned.

00:36:38.347 --> 00:36:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:42.280 align:middle line:84%
That something was causing
the boots to deteriorate.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.800 align:middle line:90%
That's what we get from that.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Not that-- you know, they were
assessing the best they could.

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:49.800 align:middle line:84%
They assumed it was
melting, but it wasn't hot.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:53.240 align:middle line:84%
But they saw these fumes coming
up, so they were thinking heat.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:56.690 align:middle line:84%
But if you have people walking
out on that, in the debris

00:36:56.690 --> 00:37:00.860 align:middle line:84%
field, and they're not
cooked, it can't be that hot.

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.317 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Impossible.

00:37:02.317 --> 00:37:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: So we know
it wasn't that hot.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.919 align:middle line:84%
And you see paper
that's not burnt.

00:37:05.919 --> 00:37:06.710 align:middle line:90%
And so we know it--

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Lying on the street
next to the toasted cars.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:09.956 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:09.956 --> 00:37:10.830 align:middle line:90%
A lot of paper.

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's one thing
people did comment on

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:15.170 align:middle line:84%
was how did this happen,
all of this fire,

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:18.770 align:middle line:84%
yet you have paper fluttering
out from these buildings

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:20.960 align:middle line:90%
and lying intact on the street.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I'd like
to show this, where

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:29.640 align:middle line:84%
this is a car park a couple
blocks from the towers.

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.790 align:middle line:84%
The white you see on the ground,
looks like snow, that's paper,

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:34.060 align:middle line:90%
unburned paper.

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And you see some flames,
it looks like flames,

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:39.540 align:middle line:90%
coming out of the vehicles.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And those vehicles
weren't towed there.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:45.010 align:middle line:90%
You can see where they were.

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:48.150 align:middle line:10%
They were at that
distance from the towers

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:50.330 align:middle line:10%
there before they're toasted.

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:51.330 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:53.720 align:middle line:10%
>>WOOD: And then
they became toasted.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.260 align:middle line:84%
There's a closer
view of them again.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:00.174 align:middle line:84%
And there's a black car out
on the drive-- the aisle there

00:38:00.174 --> 00:38:02.340 align:middle line:84%
that I thought was a white
car later because I first

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:03.790 align:middle line:90%
saw the toasted one.

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And there, the people are
running from there the scene.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:08.550 align:middle line:84%
The cars still
aren't toasted yet.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:10.141 align:middle line:90%
And then there, they're toasted.

00:38:10.141 --> 00:38:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you have any
idea what the time lapse was

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.181 align:middle line:84%
from the time that
people were running away

00:38:14.181 --> 00:38:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and the towers
disintegrating and then

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:18.370 align:middle line:90%
the toasting of the cars?

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: The vehicles,
according to first responders

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and also the various images
I've looked at, they lit up,

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:29.760 align:middle line:84%
appeared to be on fire,
they lit up immediately

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.709 align:middle line:90%
after the towers turned to dust.

00:38:31.709 --> 00:38:32.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Not while, but
immediately afterwards.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So something
was expanding outward?

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Or an after
effect occurred.

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:43.265 align:middle line:84%
Without making assumptions
as to what caused it,

00:38:43.265 --> 00:38:45.210 align:middle line:84%
it was while the dust
cloud was rolling down.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:48.470 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't necessarily
the dust cloud that did it.

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at how
this has been replicated

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:56.390 align:middle line:84%
in John Hutchison's lab, he's
got a video of a toy boat

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:58.790 align:middle line:84%
on water and you can tell
when he has his gizmo turned

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:00.280 align:middle line:84%
on because the
water is jumping up.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's levitating
and dropping back down.

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And when he turns the
gizmo off, the plastic boat

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:08.030 align:middle line:84%
goes into spontaneous
combustion.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.584 align:middle line:90%
It lights up.

00:39:08.584 --> 00:39:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.291 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It's like right
after it turns off,

00:39:11.291 --> 00:39:13.431 align:middle line:84%
sort of like something is
left out of equilibrium.

00:39:13.431 --> 00:39:15.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he's been
working with free energy

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and free energy devices
for a long time.

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.460 align:middle line:84%
We'll get into that
in a little bit.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:19.560 align:middle line:90%
He's not the only one.

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.555 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing that was
going on at that time, which

00:39:22.555 --> 00:39:25.180 align:middle line:84%
was very, very strange, I mean,
you hear of these strange fires

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:28.430 align:middle line:84%
but there was no heat,
paper intact and so forth.

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Another thing was that
there was weather,

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.530 align:middle line:90%
serious weather going on.

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm imagining if
people haven't heard you

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:37.460 align:middle line:84%
before, no one's
aware of this either.

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:42.140 align:middle line:84%
There was weather going on
right off the coast of New York,

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:45.060 align:middle line:90%
and this was a hurricane.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Was this a hurricane that
was approaching New York?

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now that's
big, big news.

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:50.540 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do
is look back a few--

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And the media likes
to milk it for all it's worth.

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You bet.

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:54.030 align:middle line:90%
Hurricanes are big news.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:55.430 align:middle line:90%
We always-- we track it.

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:58.140 align:middle line:84%
We have break-ins to, you know,
live programming break-ins

00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.070 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:01.009 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about what
was going on and maybe

00:40:01.009 --> 00:40:03.300 align:middle line:84%
we can look at some of those
images of what was sitting

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.633 align:middle line:84%
right off the coast when this
happened and why wasn't it

00:40:05.633 --> 00:40:06.190 align:middle line:90%
reported.

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It was a category three
hurricane, and for four days

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:12.630 align:middle line:84%
it went in a straight line
towards New York City.

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And each day, the forecasted
weather was not on the news,

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.710 align:middle line:84%
but offline, the Weather
Service was forecasting

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:24.445 align:middle line:84%
it's going to turn
around sometime today.

00:40:24.445 --> 00:40:25.100 align:middle line:90%
It didn't.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Day two, it's going to turn
around some time today.

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:27.235 align:middle line:90%
Didn't.

00:40:27.235 --> 00:40:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Day three, it's going to
turn around some time.

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:29.440 align:middle line:90%
Didn't.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Day four, it's going to
turn around some time.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Thank goodness it did, because
there was no more leeway.

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:36.400 align:middle line:84%
It was right outside
of Manhattan.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
sitting off the coast

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:40.850 align:middle line:84%
and no media is talking
about it in fact.

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: It's huge.

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I've seen
some clips of a video

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:45.536 align:middle line:84%
that you have where one of
the local weather casters

00:40:45.536 --> 00:40:47.305 align:middle line:84%
would say, oh, and
another sunny day here

00:40:47.305 --> 00:40:50.024 align:middle line:84%
in New York with this
looming right off the coast.

00:40:50.024 --> 00:40:50.940 align:middle line:90%
Now, I don't get that.

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:53.770 align:middle line:84%
We'd have to be getting into
a lot of conspiracy theory

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:56.310 align:middle line:84%
at this point to even
continue that conversation.

00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:59.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm only bringing it up
as yet another anomaly

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:03.270 align:middle line:84%
of very controlled
media that day,

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:05.270 align:middle line:84%
because that should've
been first up in the news

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:06.070 align:middle line:90%
that morning.

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:08.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Or the information
the announcers were given

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:09.880 align:middle line:90%
was so played down.

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was so
played down, yeah.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.260 align:middle line:84%
For what reason, we won't
even begin to speculate.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:17.200 align:middle line:84%
But just another one
of those strange events

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.140 align:middle line:90%
surrounding that day.

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:20.210 align:middle line:84%
That was sitting off the
coast, no mention of it,

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:21.085 align:middle line:90%
no one knew about it.

00:41:21.085 --> 00:41:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Most of you probably
didn't know about it

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.550 align:middle line:90%
until right now, I'm imagining.

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:27.670 align:middle line:84%
This is something-- I find
this part the most difficult

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:30.540 align:middle line:84%
and I would certainly say
if anybody watching had

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:33.270 align:middle line:84%
any connection with
somebody who was involved

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:36.180 align:middle line:84%
in those buildings, certainly
someone who may have jumped

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:40.290 align:middle line:84%
from that building,
I think I wasn't

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:43.730 align:middle line:84%
clear on the number of
people, number one, that

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:46.450 align:middle line:84%
had jumped that day
from the buildings.

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:48.630 align:middle line:90%
And, in fact, it was over 1,000.

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:51.340 align:middle line:90%
It was close to 1,200 people.

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:53.827 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know that
that was common knowledge.

00:41:53.827 --> 00:41:55.035 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't aware of it, anyway.

00:41:55.035 --> 00:41:57.740 align:middle line:90%


00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:00.390 align:middle line:84%
That's not normal for people
to jump out of buildings even

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:03.440 align:middle line:84%
if you feel there's
impending danger behind you,

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.190 align:middle line:84%
it wouldn't be your instinct
to jump to a certain death

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.060 align:middle line:90%
necessarily.

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:07.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying.

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm just talking about
basic human nature,

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:12.300 align:middle line:84%
trying to fathom
it in my own mind.

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:15.660 align:middle line:84%
But you say they jumped for
an entirely different reason.

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:16.347 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:42:16.347 --> 00:42:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you-- we
need to talk about it

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.870 align:middle line:84%
because it is
important evidence.

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:22.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: I'm not convinced
that they jumped.

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:24.070 align:middle line:90%
They went out the windows.

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:26.180 align:middle line:90%
They were out of the building.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:29.980 align:middle line:84%
There's a variety of things
that could have happened.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:35.380 align:middle line:84%
One, where if your hand's on a
stove burner, a red hot stove

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:37.130 align:middle line:84%
burner, you don't stop
and think about it.

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:38.660 align:middle line:90%
That hand's off of there.

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:39.874 align:middle line:90%
It's reflex.

00:42:39.874 --> 00:42:40.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: So if there's
some sort of energy

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.560 align:middle line:84%
field within the building
that's so painful

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.730 align:middle line:84%
you just have to
get away from it,

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:48.440 align:middle line:84%
then suddenly they're
out the window,

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.660 align:middle line:90%
like how did I get here?

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Or is there some kind
of an energy field

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.850 align:middle line:90%
that pulled them out?

00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:54.710 align:middle line:90%
Or threw them out?

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:55.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or pushed them?

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:55.941 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:42:55.941 --> 00:42:57.040 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the thing that
was anomalous about this,

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:03.650 align:middle line:84%
first responders have to deal
with all kinds of tragedies.

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And certainly someone leaping
from a building in a suicide

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:10.420 align:middle line:84%
attempt has a certain
characteristic.

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:13.100 align:middle line:84%
You have a body that's
lying on the ground broken,

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:15.242 align:middle line:90%
maybe crumpled and broken.

00:43:15.242 --> 00:43:17.200 align:middle line:84%
That's not what was
happening with these bodies

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.340 align:middle line:84%
and if you could explain what
some of the firemen were saying

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:22.940 align:middle line:84%
and what they were seeing,
that would be very helpful.

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It was, you know,
body parts all over the place

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.510 align:middle line:90%
and they're just mush often.

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:33.110 align:middle line:84%
I've got a picture here
of the 105th floor.

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:36.370 align:middle line:84%
You see above the
gash in the building

00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:38.490 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of people hanging
outside of the building.

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And if we look
closer, a lot of them

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:42.971 align:middle line:84%
don't have many clothes
on, and the one--

00:43:42.971 --> 00:43:44.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they've
started stripping.

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.719 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: The one with the
arrow pointing at looks

00:43:46.719 --> 00:43:48.570 align:middle line:90%
like he's taking his pants off.

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:51.630 align:middle line:84%
So why would somebody be
hanging from the 105th floor

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:55.380 align:middle line:84%
outside the building
taking their pants off?

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
presumably by this time,

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:03.351 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't be thinking clearly
if what you're saying happened

00:44:03.351 --> 00:44:03.850 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:06.087 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: But it takes
thinking clearly

00:44:06.087 --> 00:44:08.170 align:middle line:84%
to be hanging on to the
building while doing this.

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:10.135 align:middle line:84%
That's a pretty
complicated maneuver--

00:44:10.135 --> 00:44:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: -to be hanging
by the hand and a foot.

00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:14.370 align:middle line:84%
But if there was
smoke inside, you'd

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:17.747 align:middle line:84%
take in a big deep breath, step
inside, take the pants off,

00:44:17.747 --> 00:44:18.330 align:middle line:90%
step back out.

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: But it is indicative
of some kind of energy field.

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Something going on
internally inside their bodies.

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Inside the
building, it was much worse.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:29.609 align:middle line:84%
And if you think of an
analogy to this, microwave.

00:44:29.609 --> 00:44:30.900 align:middle line:90%
You know, the microwave crowds.

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
a first thought.

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:33.380 align:middle line:90%
Microwave crowds.

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And we see these horrible
little YouTube videos

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and such where someone
is doing something

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:41.970 align:middle line:84%
horrible to a little animal and
putting it inside a microwave

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:45.290 align:middle line:84%
oven, essentially the way
these people were coming down,

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:50.030 align:middle line:84%
the way they were exploding
like a watermelon on impact,

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:52.734 align:middle line:84%
and even breaking
apart before impact,

00:44:52.734 --> 00:44:54.150 align:middle line:84%
would indicate
there was something

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:56.700 align:middle line:84%
that was changing their
molecular structure.

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you hit a
deer on the highway,

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.650 align:middle line:84%
you don't find a hoof
over here and an ear down,

00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:05.090 align:middle line:84%
and a tooth over,
you find a busted

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:08.090 align:middle line:84%
up deer kind of in
the same vicinity.

00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:12.234 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- there's
something else going on.

00:45:12.234 --> 00:45:13.900 align:middle line:84%
There's various
descriptions, especially

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:16.510 align:middle line:90%
of things being mush.

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:18.052 align:middle line:90%
Like they're liquefied kind of.

00:45:18.052 --> 00:45:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
firemen saying it

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:21.540 align:middle line:84%
was raining bodies
and body parts.

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yes.

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:24.374 align:middle line:84%
So we just need to
put that in there

00:45:24.374 --> 00:45:25.790 align:middle line:84%
along with all the
other evidence,

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:28.248 align:middle line:84%
even though it's very grisly
because these are human beings

00:45:28.248 --> 00:45:29.825 align:middle line:90%
and it's very, very difficult.

00:45:29.825 --> 00:45:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And it must have been so
terrible for the firefighters.

00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:33.408 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Can't fathom.

00:45:33.408 --> 00:45:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Because they're
so geared to saving lives.

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And there's
nothing they could do.

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:38.981 align:middle line:90%
They were helpless.

00:45:38.981 --> 00:45:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing worse
than feeling helpless.

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:43.261 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we bring it
up because, again, this

00:45:43.261 --> 00:45:45.470 align:middle line:84%
is not anything that
was reported to us.

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: No.

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People don't
understand the nature of that.

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: We know of one
or two, or three or four,

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:52.330 align:middle line:84%
maybe up to six people
that came out the windows.

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:54.720 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking
about three or four

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:58.630 align:middle line:84%
per minute out of each face of
the building for 100 minutes.

00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: About 1,200.

00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:02.010 align:middle line:90%
Roughly 1,200.

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:04.310 align:middle line:84%
OK, and we can get
into-- do you want

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:07.680 align:middle line:84%
to get into the thermite and
the iron-rich microspheres

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:10.010 align:middle line:90%
and what that is saying?

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And also maybe even get into
the Tes-- this is a good time

00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:16.470 align:middle line:84%
to get into the Tesla
technology and the event

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:21.530 align:middle line:84%
that there's not a
definitive answer to it yet.

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:26.050 align:middle line:84%
But back in Tesla's day,
there was the Tunguska affair

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:28.490 align:middle line:84%
in Siberia and maybe you
can talk a little bit

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:31.250 align:middle line:84%
about that and some of the
components of that that

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:34.039 align:middle line:84%
are similar to
what happened here.

00:46:34.039 --> 00:46:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: We don't know for
sure what happened back then,

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:38.540 align:middle line:84%
but the sampling
of the vegetation

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:42.370 align:middle line:84%
there, they found these
iron-rich microspheres

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:46.970 align:middle line:90%
in the plant life at Tunguska.

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:48.755 align:middle line:84%
Also, there's
iron-rich microspheres

00:46:48.755 --> 00:46:51.270 align:middle line:90%
found in crop circles.

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:52.310 align:middle line:90%
Pretty strange.

00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:55.060 align:middle line:84%
How do you do that
without burning the crops?

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:58.080 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty odd.

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Again, those aren't indicative--
if you find one little detail

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:04.870 align:middle line:84%
and you make a
conclusion of it, you're

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:06.750 align:middle line:84%
assuming the problem
you're solving.

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:08.410 align:middle line:90%
That's not a real problem.

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:10.460 align:middle line:84%
That's an imagined
problem you're solving.

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:11.960 align:middle line:84%
You need to start
with the beginning

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:13.680 align:middle line:84%
and figure out what
happened instead

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:16.990 align:middle line:84%
of cherry-picking evidence
to support whatever

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:20.020 align:middle line:84%
idea that-- you know, whatever
answer that you come up with.

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:23.514 align:middle line:84%
If I told you the answer
is 27, am I right?

00:47:23.514 --> 00:47:24.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:26.140 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's see the evidence.

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: What's the
problem that I'm solving?

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's the
problem, exactly.

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: You've got to
know what the problem is

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:30.720 align:middle line:90%
to know if it's right or wrong.

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And so saying it
was thermite, what's it?

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:36.990 align:middle line:84%
We saw the buildings
turn to dust.

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we know that these
three events you were talking

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:42.670 align:middle line:84%
about all happen to have
this anomaly, crop circles,

00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:45.610 align:middle line:84%
this particular event, and back
at the turn of the last century

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:47.470 align:middle line:90%
with Tesla.

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:48.967 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Weird energy effects--

00:47:48.967 --> 00:47:49.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: -that could occur.

00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:51.763 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about that energy

00:47:51.763 --> 00:47:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and let's talk about
John Hutchison.

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:55.010 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he's a brilliant man.

00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:57.510 align:middle line:84%
He's been working with
free energy and magnetism

00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:59.240 align:middle line:90%
and such for quite a long time.

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk
about what happened

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:04.510 align:middle line:84%
in his apartment
following all of this.

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:06.012 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Various things occurred.

00:48:06.012 --> 00:48:07.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know which aspect
you're talking about,

00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:09.700 align:middle line:84%
but when he does an
experiment, sometime

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.450 align:middle line:84%
in the neighbor's
apartment things happen.

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:12.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.067 align:middle line:84%
I've seen some of
the videos too.

00:48:14.067 --> 00:48:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: And there's a
particular photograph.

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:18.200 align:middle line:90%
They discovered his work.

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:18.970 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:22.650 align:middle line:84%
This person's produced
all the same phenomenon

00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:24.940 align:middle line:84%
that I've discovered
at World Trade Center.

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And so when I
contacted him, there's

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.110 align:middle line:84%
a particular picture
I sent him that has

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:31.460 align:middle line:84%
a toasted car and in front
of it, and upside down car.

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.710 align:middle line:84%
It's parked in the right
place, but the tires

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:36.550 align:middle line:84%
are aimed up rather than down,
in front of a building where

00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:39.470 align:middle line:84%
the facade is OK except
all the marble is gone

00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:42.150 align:middle line:84%
and it has these weird
holes in the windows.

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And it just kind of sums
up the whole situation.

00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
did he do exactly?

00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:46.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
sent him this picture

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.504 align:middle line:84%
and I said, does your
neighborhood ever

00:48:48.504 --> 00:48:49.710 align:middle line:90%
get to looking like this?

00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:53.810 align:middle line:84%
Because it captured so
much of the information.

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:56.240 align:middle line:84%
What he does is
create a static field,

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.790 align:middle line:84%
and within that static field,
he interferes various radio

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:01.440 align:middle line:90%
frequency signals.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:03.450 align:middle line:84%
He used to use a
Tesla coil, but then

00:49:03.450 --> 00:49:06.626 align:middle line:84%
later years, started using
a Van De Graaff generator.

00:49:06.626 --> 00:49:08.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, those things
that you put your hand

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:09.860 align:middle line:84%
on the top and your
hair stands on end.

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: You know, just creating
a whole lot of static field.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And within that--
microwave is one

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:21.370 align:middle line:84%
of the most frequently used
signals that he would use,

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:25.730 align:middle line:84%
and weird things would happen,
depending on how it's used

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:28.785 align:middle line:84%
and what combination of signals
and what shape of the waves.

00:49:28.785 --> 00:49:35.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, square wave versus
pointed wave versus spikes.

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.870 align:middle line:84%
There's other weird
combinations he would come up

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:39.940 align:middle line:84%
with that would do
different things.

00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.497 align:middle line:84%
And he'd get things
levitating, flying.

00:49:42.497 --> 00:49:43.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.880 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Something just
take off and fly away.

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:49.960 align:middle line:84%
He'd get metals just
deteriorating, just crumbling

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:52.290 align:middle line:90%
into powder.

00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:55.850 align:middle line:84%
There's a video I
have where it-- he's

00:49:55.850 --> 00:50:01.010 align:middle line:84%
got this iron block that
just doubles over and fumes.

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Just like the door handles--

00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:03.676 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:03.676 --> 00:50:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: -from 9/11.

00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:05.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From 9/11.

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:08.110 align:middle line:84%
So he's able to do
this, and this is not

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:11.480 align:middle line:84%
a man who has his Ph.D. in
physics or anything else,

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:12.020 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:12.603 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Right.

00:50:12.603 --> 00:50:14.890 align:middle line:84%
He's got an eighth grade
education formally.

00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:18.000 align:middle line:84%
He was kind of home
schooled after that.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:24.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's good that he's
outside of the normal system,

00:50:24.310 --> 00:50:27.750 align:middle line:84%
free to explore
into other things.

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Like Ed Leedskalnin, I
understand, had a fourth grade

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.660 align:middle line:90%
education formally.

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.780 align:middle line:90%
And look what he created.

00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:40.350 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, this gets down to
if a man with an ima-- not just

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:42.850 align:middle line:84%
an imagination, who knows
what else is involved.

00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's some deep
memory, whether it's

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:47.820 align:middle line:84%
some connection with the
unified field of information

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:51.710 align:middle line:84%
or whatnot, that people come
about this kind of information

00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:56.370 align:middle line:84%
and are able to put it
together is not necessarily

00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:57.630 align:middle line:90%
a complete anomaly.

00:50:57.630 --> 00:51:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Many, many people have put these
pieces together, I suppose.

00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And I remember you
saying to me once before

00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:08.260 align:middle line:84%
that the Pentagon was fully
aware of Hutchison's work

00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and this technology
20 years ago.

00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: 1983, the--

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Almost 20 years ago.

00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Almost-- I mean, and
maybe even prior to that.

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:18.880 align:middle line:84%
But you know for a fact
they were at that time.

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.255 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: For four
months they were

00:51:20.255 --> 00:51:22.630 align:middle line:84%
at his place filming
everything he did.

00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:26.140 align:middle line:90%
But it's the mindset of people.

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:30.840 align:middle line:84%
There's, I think, a different--
stuff that's gone underground,

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:32.770 align:middle line:90%
it's not known.

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And people understand
that it's not known

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:37.550 align:middle line:90%
and they don't look for it.

00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And you have a very
specific piece in this

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:42.522 align:middle line:90%
that you want to say.

00:51:42.522 --> 00:51:44.730 align:middle line:84%
We have only a few minutes
left and before we finish,

00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:47.320 align:middle line:84%
I want to read an email
your father sent you,

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:49.130 align:middle line:84%
your 90-year-old
father sent you today

00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:51.120 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's
really a perfect way

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:52.530 align:middle line:90%
to end this discussion.

00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:57.870 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about what you
see in terms of the future.

00:51:57.870 --> 00:52:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, as tragic as 9/11 was,
you see hope in the technology

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:04.590 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:07.040 align:middle line:84%
There's living proof
that free energy works.

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:10.460 align:middle line:84%
We just saw its devastating
consequences, apparently,

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:11.430 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:13.415 align:middle line:84%
And look at your
well-loved book, this is--

00:52:13.415 --> 00:52:13.956 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Yeah.

00:52:13.956 --> 00:52:15.340 align:middle line:84%
On the cover of
the book, you see

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:17.690 align:middle line:90%
the buildings turning to dust.

00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:20.095 align:middle line:84%
With John Hutchison,
to see his technology,

00:52:20.095 --> 00:52:22.130 align:middle line:84%
you have to go to
his lab to see it.

00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:24.790 align:middle line:84%
But this is something
the entire planet saw.

00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Everyone can then understand
that free energy technology

00:52:27.810 --> 00:52:28.670 align:middle line:90%
exists.

00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:30.364 align:middle line:90%
It was demonstrated before us.

00:52:30.364 --> 00:52:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: This is-- I'm not
saying that free energy powered

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:36.180 align:middle line:90%
some other gizmo.

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:37.920 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is
there's something

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:41.550 align:middle line:84%
that exists that can turn
buildings into dust in midair.

00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:44.540 align:middle line:84%
That technology can provide
us with free energy.

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:47.740 align:middle line:84%
So 9/11 is evidence that free
energy technology exists.

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's where you
see the hope in all of this.

00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:52.920 align:middle line:84%
You're hoping to alert people,
just look at the evidence,

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:54.410 align:middle line:90%
understand what happened.

00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:57.170 align:middle line:84%
Because then maybe we can start
educating ourselves differently

00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:58.170 align:middle line:90%
and move in a new direction.

00:52:58.170 --> 00:52:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: Exactly.

00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now I want to read
what your father wrote to you.

00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:02.893 align:middle line:84%
Your father was a
naysayer and thought

00:53:02.893 --> 00:53:05.350 align:middle line:84%
you were a little
bit out there when

00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:06.925 align:middle line:84%
you started this
whole exploration.

00:53:06.925 --> 00:53:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: Because
nobody agreed with me.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.375 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nobody
agreed with you.

00:53:09.375 --> 00:53:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Here he says, "Dear Judy,
another anniversary date

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.520 align:middle line:90%
of 9/11.

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Listening to the
news broadcast, it

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:16.520 align:middle line:84%
seems striking that the
scientific community remains

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:18.100 align:middle line:90%
so silent of what happened.

00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Political discussion
passes over what

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:22.210 align:middle line:84%
happened with a
single word, fire.

00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Like look at all
that smoke, never

00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:26.980 align:middle line:84%
mind the streets full
of unburned paper.

00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:29.100 align:middle line:84%
This all reminded me
again of how basic

00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:31.470 align:middle line:84%
your book is to the
understanding of what happened.

00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:33.940 align:middle line:84%
It also points out the fact
that no official study of what

00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:35.870 align:middle line:84%
happened ever took
place, and the world

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:38.510 align:middle line:84%
goes on without an official
finding of the event.

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:41.830 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest events
in history to go unexamined,

00:53:41.830 --> 00:53:44.600 align:middle line:84%
and no one else had the courage
to carefully examine the events

00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:48.150 align:middle line:84%
with a singular position
you have in world-- what

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:51.650 align:middle line:84%
a singular position you
have in world history.

00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:54.450 align:middle line:84%
As you have often
said, you have not

00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:57.320 align:middle line:84%
written about your opinions,
you just reported what happened.

00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And your report still stands
without successful challenge.

00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:05.020 align:middle line:84%
So, on this anniversary
date, congratulations

00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:06.130 align:middle line:90%
are still in order.

00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Hope you have a
nice day, my dear.

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:10.033 align:middle line:90%
Love, Dad."

00:54:10.033 --> 00:54:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WOOD: It's wonderful.

00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is wonderful,
and it makes me teary, too,

00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:15.004 align:middle line:90%
because it's been hard.

00:54:15.004 --> 00:54:16.170 align:middle line:90%
You've been out there alone.

00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Everybody from every
angle has slammed you.

00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:21.770 align:middle line:84%
The conspiracy theorists
have slammed you.

00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, the people
in official circles

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:26.642 align:middle line:84%
have slammed you and you've
just stood your ground

00:54:26.642 --> 00:54:28.100 align:middle line:84%
with your truth
about the evidence.

00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:29.558 align:middle line:84%
>>WOOD: It's right
before our eyes.

00:54:29.558 --> 00:54:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, to further
familiarize yourself

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:38.860 align:middle line:84%
with Judy's work, you can go to
her website and drjudywood.com,

00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:40.790 align:middle line:84%
and look at the
array of evidence.

00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:42.480 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely stunning.

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thanks for
joining us here at Gaiam TV.
