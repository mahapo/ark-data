>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Harvey Bigelsen

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.130 align:middle line:84%
is what I call a
rebel with a cause.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.035 align:middle line:84%
Having spent his life swimming
upstream as a medical doctor,

00:00:23.035 --> 00:00:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Harvey has not backed
down in his commitment

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.810 align:middle line:84%
to bringing subtle therapies
to the public at large.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.400 align:middle line:84%
One of the pioneers in
homeopathic philosophy

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.650 align:middle line:84%
in the US, Harvey wrote the
Homeopathic Medical Practice

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Act in the state
of Arizona, which

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.070 align:middle line:84%
allowed MDs who wanted to
practice outside of the box

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.140 align:middle line:90%
to do so without repercussions.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Sadly, this brought
the wrath of the AMA

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.180 align:middle line:84%
down on Harvey's
head, which forced

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.490 align:middle line:90%
him to leave the country.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Harvey is with us
today to tell us

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:84%
about the journey
of doctors who wish

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.950 align:middle line:84%
to practice beyond the extremely
limited confines of AMA

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:54.721 align:middle line:90%
regulations.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And Harvey, I have to say,
of all the people I've met,

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.990 align:middle line:90%
you've been through the ringer.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.114 align:middle line:90%
You've been through it all.

00:00:59.114 --> 00:01:00.950 align:middle line:90%
They've taken your license away.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.730 align:middle line:84%
They forced you south of the
border and everything else.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.990 align:middle line:10%
But you always find a way
to still continue growing,

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.100 align:middle line:10%
not only your knowledge, your
ability to work with people.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.050 align:middle line:10%
I mean avant garde
therapies-- and here you

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.091 align:middle line:10%
are in the United States.

00:01:13.091 --> 00:01:16.250 align:middle line:10%
But you can't prick people with
pins or anything or needles.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.030 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.050 align:middle line:90%
You can't touch us.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.782 align:middle line:90%
But you can certainly guide us.

00:01:19.782 --> 00:01:21.032 align:middle line:90%
>>HARVEY BIGELSEN: Yes, I can.

00:01:21.032 --> 00:01:21.532 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:01:21.532 --> 00:01:23.710 align:middle line:10%
In the United States, I
don't follow their laws,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.669 align:middle line:10%
so they don't like me.

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:25.210 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: No.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.280 align:middle line:10%
And the interesting thing
to me in all of this

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.500 align:middle line:10%
is you genuinely tried
through writing this act

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.840 align:middle line:10%
to bring something
together that would allow

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.660 align:middle line:10%
for an open sharing
of this knowledge.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.836 align:middle line:84%
And it did not go the
way you planned at all.

00:01:39.836 --> 00:01:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: No, not at all.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.400 align:middle line:90%
I was really naive.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.590 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize how nasty
they were, how controlling they

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.090 align:middle line:90%
were.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.670 align:middle line:90%
It never entered my mind.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.275 align:middle line:84%
I thought we lived
in a free country.

00:01:51.275 --> 00:01:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, so now you know.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.630 align:middle line:90%
And in certain ways we do.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.910 align:middle line:90%
Others we don't, certainly.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, what I'd like
you to do-- because to me,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.989 align:middle line:84%
you represent that
journey of all the doctors

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:03.030 align:middle line:90%
who've been through this.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.696 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
wanted to bring you on.

00:02:04.696 --> 00:02:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Because you've been through
so many aspects of what

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.380 align:middle line:84%
happens from the moment you
decide to go out of the box.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, you left
allopathic medicine in 1976.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.070 align:middle line:84%
I remember reading
in your book that you

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.240 align:middle line:84%
had in medical school
said, OK, yeah, I

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.970 align:middle line:84%
can see we have
to cut this colon.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.210 align:middle line:84%
But how did it become
diseased in the first place?

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.880 align:middle line:90%
They didn't like the question.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.312 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what you
really get in medical school.

00:02:32.312 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: First year of
medical-- really frustrated

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.216 align:middle line:90%
medical school.

00:02:36.216 --> 00:02:37.590 align:middle line:84%
The first year of
medical school,

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.380 align:middle line:84%
you're taught all the
normals of the body.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Second year, you're
taught all the diseases.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.920 align:middle line:84%
They make no connection between
the first and second year, OK?

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And most important,
of course, they

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.520 align:middle line:84%
don't teach you how you
get from the second year

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.530 align:middle line:90%
back to the first year.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.460 align:middle line:90%
I'd ask questions.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.410 align:middle line:84%
How did you get from a normal
colon to ulcerative colitis?

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And they just told me
to read the books, OK?

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.526 align:middle line:84%
And the books didn't
tell you anything.

00:02:58.526 --> 00:02:59.650 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing in between.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.120 align:middle line:84%
You're either perfectly
healthy or you're severely ill.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.450 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And everything is categorized
with no understanding

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.349 align:middle line:90%
of how one led to the other.

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so,
of course-- I mean,

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.348 align:middle line:84%
I think most of
the people watching

00:03:12.348 --> 00:03:14.820 align:middle line:84%
this know that-- in
terms of wellness,

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.969 align:middle line:84%
in terms of nutrition,
that's not really

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:18.760 align:middle line:84%
a large part of the
course of study at all.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.745 align:middle line:84%
It's--what-- a
couple hours maybe?

00:03:20.745 --> 00:03:22.411 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Firs oft
all, we didn't even

00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:24.360 align:middle line:90%
have nutrition, number one.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.121 align:middle line:84%
Number two, wellness
is never ever taught.

00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:29.870 align:middle line:84%
How you get a person
well is never taught.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.390 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that's
taught is what drugs to use

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.382 align:middle line:84%
and how to cut a
person open, OK?

00:03:34.382 --> 00:03:36.590 align:middle line:84%
You're never taught how to
get a person better, which

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.850 align:middle line:84%
is-- it so frustrated
me, by the time

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.280 align:middle line:84%
I got out of medical
school, I was

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.600 align:middle line:84%
major depressed because it
never told you anything.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.230 align:middle line:90%
I just kept on asking questions.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.191 align:middle line:90%
And I never got an answer.

00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the
thing is, because they

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.050 align:middle line:84%
went through the
same system, they

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.290 align:middle line:84%
weren't trained to
give you an answer.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.070 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have the answers
you were looking for.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: No, yeah, right.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.370 align:middle line:90%
They did not have the answers.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And they were such
a prejudiced group.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.020 align:middle line:84%
I remember the first
day of medical school,

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:84%
the first word out--
distinguished professor

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.040 align:middle line:90%
was a Nobel Prize nominee.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Wrote the word
homeopathy on the board.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about all these
little funny invisible things

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.430 align:middle line:90%
that attack us.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And we thought that was
so funny and stupid.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.141 align:middle line:84%
And we went through
every other profession.

00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:16.170 align:middle line:84%
By the end of three hours,
we were the greatest.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.050 align:middle line:90%
We were the kings.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.760 align:middle line:90%
We were the anointed ones.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
medical school was.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:90%
They worked your tail off.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.520 align:middle line:90%
And you were the anointed ones.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How many of the
people, in your own observation

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.420 align:middle line:84%
in this world-- it seems
that most of the people that

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.710 align:middle line:84%
go into it do want
to do some good.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.010 align:middle line:84%
They want to be of
help, of service.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And is it simply
ignorance of what else

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.910 align:middle line:84%
exists that makes them believe
this is the only way to do it?

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.625 align:middle line:84%
Or is there an
allure beyond that?

00:04:44.625 --> 00:04:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: They're
going through

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.565 align:middle line:84%
and, actually, nowadays,
most people more

00:04:48.565 --> 00:04:51.130 align:middle line:84%
are going into it because
you can make a living on it.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Originally, when I
went to medical school,

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.731 align:middle line:84%
everyone was there
that was at top, OK?

00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:84%
If you were the top
student in your class,

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.502 align:middle line:84%
you were going to be
called a doctor, OK?

00:04:58.502 --> 00:04:59.460 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing else.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.690 align:middle line:90%
And they went into it.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was stunned at the
very, very bright people

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.160 align:middle line:90%
in medical school.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.000 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't ask questions.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.430 align:middle line:84%
They just spouted
out what was given.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.370 align:middle line:90%
And no one asked a question.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And medical school was
such a rigorous training

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.590 align:middle line:84%
that by the time you
came out, got out

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.019 align:middle line:84%
of school and
everything, you just

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:21.060 align:middle line:84%
wanted to make money and
live happily ever after.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And now pay off
your student loans

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.960 align:middle line:84%
because you have a couple
hundred thousand of debt

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.520 align:middle line:90%
on your back just getting out.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.480 align:middle line:90%
And that is a problem.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you do have to
go where the money is.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what was happening

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.520 align:middle line:84%
earlier in the
20th century, where

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.242 align:middle line:84%
we had a plethora of
alternatives to medical school.

00:05:39.242 --> 00:05:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what
that environment was like

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.700 align:middle line:84%
and what was available
if you wanted

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.880 align:middle line:90%
to go into the field of healing.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.392 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Going back to the
beginning of the 20th century,

00:05:47.392 --> 00:05:49.100 align:middle line:84%
there were several
different professions.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And most of them were
natural type of professions.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.350 align:middle line:84%
The AMA themselves, they
actually started in 1847.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.691 align:middle line:90%
And they went out.

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:00.482 align:middle line:84%
One of the first things
they did was set up

00:06:00.482 --> 00:06:01.607 align:middle line:90%
a department of propaganda.

00:06:01.607 --> 00:06:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And they went out to
eliminate all the competition.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And in 1910, Rockefeller
sponsors them, OK?

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And his sponsoring
really, step by step,

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.440 align:middle line:84%
slowly gets rid of
the alternative people

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.550 align:middle line:84%
and makes these
people the king, OK?

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And the irony of
Rockefeller-- to tell you

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.635 align:middle line:84%
the whole true story of
it-- he was a vegetarian.

00:06:22.635 --> 00:06:26.160 align:middle line:84%
He lived to the age of
94, never saw a doctor.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And he worked with a homeopathic
physician all the time.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.780 align:middle line:84%
But yet he sponsored the
pharmaceutical companies

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.520 align:middle line:84%
because that's where money
was made, plain and simple.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.740 align:middle line:84%
That tells you a lot
about the country.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, you told me off
camera about another person.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.880 align:middle line:84%
They had access to a
document or something that

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.190 align:middle line:84%
had to do with the
field of chiropractic,

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.810 align:middle line:84%
that there was a specific
effort to eradicate

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.874 align:middle line:84%
the country of
chiropractors at one point.

00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: I hired
a private detective.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Because when they started
coming after me, after a while,

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.710 align:middle line:90%
there was a reality to it.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.210 align:middle line:84%
I was almost living a
Kafkaesque novel over there.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.459 align:middle line:84%
And I hired a private
detective to find out

00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:11.500 align:middle line:90%
what was really going on.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.710 align:middle line:84%
He was an interesting
private detective.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:19.280 align:middle line:84%
He, back in the
'60s actually-- I

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.210 align:middle line:84%
think it was the
'60s or early '70s--

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.170 align:middle line:84%
he goes into the
AMA headquarters

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.830 align:middle line:84%
with phony credentials
as a newspaper man.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And he wants to go after
alternative medicine

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:28.430 align:middle line:90%
supposedly.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.630 align:middle line:90%
So they let him into the files.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And he finds in the
files in the minutes

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.342 align:middle line:84%
of a meeting in
November of 1963--

00:07:37.342 --> 00:07:40.610 align:middle line:84%
the meeting says that
basically they're

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.000 align:middle line:84%
going to go out for the
containment of chiropractic,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.670 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, the elimination
of chiropractic.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.330 align:middle line:90%
That was step one by the AMA.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.750 align:middle line:84%
The concept-- they
were going out

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.080 align:middle line:84%
first to organize to
smear the chiropractors,

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.810 align:middle line:84%
to make them lowly, and then
eliminate them and get them out

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:56.810 align:middle line:90%
of the system.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And the chiropractors--
what happened-- actually,

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.180 align:middle line:90%
the chiropractors sue the AMA.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.285 align:middle line:84%
And the AMA paid them off $10
million behind the scenes.

00:08:04.285 --> 00:08:05.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: They paid them
off, because the chiropractors

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:07.254 align:middle line:90%
were right.

00:08:07.254 --> 00:08:08.170 align:middle line:90%
So they kept it quiet.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:09.530 align:middle line:90%
An they just paid them off.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.940 align:middle line:90%
And the chiropractors went away.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And now they're not really
covered by insurance,

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.770 align:middle line:90%
though AMA is.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.420 align:middle line:84%
They are secondary
physicians completely.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.794 align:middle line:84%
So for $10 million, they bought
out the chiropractic system.

00:08:20.794 --> 00:08:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's important
to know too-- a lot of people

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.280 align:middle line:90%
think, oh, chiropractors.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.779 align:middle line:84%
They probably go
to a week-- I mean,

00:08:25.779 --> 00:08:27.500 align:middle line:84%
if you don't know
anything about it,

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.250 align:middle line:84%
you think, oh,
back crackers, they

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.549 align:middle line:84%
must go to some kind of a
trade course to do that,

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:35.130 align:middle line:84%
not understanding these
guys go through virtually

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.140 align:middle line:84%
the same number of years of
medical school that an MD does.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And these are highly
proficient practitioners.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Yeah,
they learn structure.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Structure is a real
key in the body.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.330 align:middle line:84%
We're never taught
how one bone is

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.830 align:middle line:90%
aligned against another bone.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not for the cracking
of the chiropractors.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.760 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot
of chiropractors

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.530 align:middle line:90%
that don't crack--

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:52.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --that manipulate.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.094 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: --that
just manipulate,

00:08:54.094 --> 00:08:55.135 align:middle line:90%
and get the body aligned.

00:08:55.135 --> 00:09:00.790 align:middle line:10%
And to me, the structure
of the body is holy, OK?

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.416 align:middle line:10%
One famous physician said,
"Disease cannot exist where

00:09:04.416 --> 00:09:05.645 align:middle line:10%
there are no obstructions."

00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:08.161 align:middle line:84%
If you have an obstruction
in the flow of things,

00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:09.160 align:middle line:90%
you get a stagnant pond.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.000 align:middle line:84%
In the stagnant pond,
the garbage happens.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.410 align:middle line:84%
The key is to open
that structure up.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:15.150 align:middle line:90%
This is holy.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.330 align:middle line:84%
I look at the human body
as an eight-cylinder car

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.819 align:middle line:90%
created by God, OK?

00:09:20.819 --> 00:09:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And things like Lyme
disease, they're

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.443 align:middle line:90%
running on four cylinders.

00:09:23.443 --> 00:09:25.180 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to
do with the germ.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.582 align:middle line:84%
I try to figure out why the
cylinders aren't working.

00:09:27.582 --> 00:09:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah so this gained
you a lot of popularity

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.420 align:middle line:84%
in medical school, as
we already talked about.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes, it did.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.733 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so the
propaganda department--

00:09:33.733 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:84%
is-- what exactly-- how did
they express themselves?

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.612 align:middle line:84%
How were they
utilized at the time?

00:09:39.612 --> 00:09:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't know the AMA
had a propaganda department.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.695 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: No.

00:09:42.695 --> 00:09:44.520 align:middle line:90%
That started in 1847.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.589 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And does it
still exist on some level,

00:09:46.589 --> 00:09:48.380 align:middle line:84%
or does it happen just
through advertising?

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: It exists on more
of not an open level, OK?

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.870 align:middle line:90%
The AMA, they won their show.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.240 align:middle line:84%
They got their kingdom
that they want.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.330 align:middle line:84%
So basically, they
got all the things.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.750 align:middle line:84%
They don't need to have that
propaganda as much anymore.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.110 align:middle line:90%
But they still do.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you watch all
the commercials on TV.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.040 align:middle line:90%
And everything's propaganda.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of the
things that I talk about--

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.250 align:middle line:84%
if they're so good,
what's their cure rate?

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.341 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Do you how many
chronic diseases they found

00:10:15.341 --> 00:10:16.790 align:middle line:84%
a cure for in the
last 100 years?

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:17.290 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:17.915 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Zero.

00:10:17.915 --> 00:10:18.856 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Zero.

00:10:18.856 --> 00:10:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:20.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.500 align:middle line:84%
So they've shut down the
non-allopathic schools

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.310 align:middle line:90%
for the most part.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.330 align:middle line:90%
They marginalize chiropractors.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Homeopathic schools
were over 40%

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.865 align:middle line:84%
of the schools at the time
in the early 1900s, right?

00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes, they were.

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And the last two homeopathic
schools became medical schools.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.690 align:middle line:90%
It was in 1944.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Samuel Hahnemann-- Hahnemann
Medical School-- the founder

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.716 align:middle line:84%
of homeopathy became
a medical school.

00:10:42.716 --> 00:10:44.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:45.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's had to
turn over in his grave

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:46.860 align:middle line:90%
for that old philosophy.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He has to.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: And then
Flower and Fifth

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.807 align:middle line:84%
Avenue in New York
became the last one

00:10:50.807 --> 00:10:53.100 align:middle line:84%
to become a medical
school in 1947.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yeah,
it's ironic, as you say,

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:58.020 align:middle line:84%
that Rockefeller himself,
certainly people that

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.812 align:middle line:84%
have the know-how-- and
they have the knowledge.

00:11:01.812 --> 00:11:04.020 align:middle line:84%
They have the history with
it-- even the royal family

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.910 align:middle line:84%
of England, they all
choose homeopathy

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.390 align:middle line:90%
as their primary medicine.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.270 align:middle line:90%
That's primary medicine.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.450 align:middle line:84%
This would be--
allopathic medicine

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.270 align:middle line:84%
would be-- more
of a last resort.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And yet-- and I know you
have a real bug about this--

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.580 align:middle line:84%
it's been flipped
around in our mind.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:22.850 align:middle line:84%
The natural is now secondary to
what, essentially, should be--

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.360 align:middle line:84%
well, allopathic
is a knocked down

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.740 align:middle line:84%
version of what
nature creates, right?

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:28.650 align:middle line:90%
Reverse engineered.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: It's totally
stopping all of nature.

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:32.810 align:middle line:84%
The word antibiotic
means anti-life.

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.209 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's right there.

00:11:35.209 --> 00:11:36.250 align:middle line:90%
But people don't realize.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:37.666 align:middle line:84%
They think you
take an antibiotic,

00:11:37.666 --> 00:11:38.996 align:middle line:90%
it's gonna kill one nasty germ.

00:11:38.996 --> 00:11:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've got
billions of germs in us

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:41.536 align:middle line:90%
that are very helpful.

00:11:41.536 --> 00:11:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:42.795 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: OK.

00:11:42.795 --> 00:11:44.279 align:middle line:90%
No, that's--

00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.430 align:middle line:90%
So they won that battle.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, another way they do it--
I have this written down here.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.246 align:middle line:84%
And this is something you
dealt with-- the Committee

00:11:51.246 --> 00:11:52.160 align:middle line:90%
on Quackery.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
various committees

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.590 align:middle line:84%
that are out there to make
sure that anyone who does

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.490 align:middle line:90%
go outside the box is contained.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: They formed
the National Council

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Against Health Fraud, which
is a committee on quackery.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:09.310 align:middle line:84%
That committee was really
designed to smear others,

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:13.210 align:middle line:84%
to go out and try to eliminate
them with the state agencies.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, they actually had
someone assigned in Arizona

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.020 align:middle line:84%
from the University of
Arizona to go after me

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:23.500 align:middle line:84%
and to try to smear me because
I had so much power in Arizona.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And the irony of
what went on with him

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:29.890 align:middle line:84%
was not that long ago, he
died on an operating table.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.500 align:middle line:84%
He died in their
hands, which is just

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.260 align:middle line:90%
exactly what I'm telling people.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.748 align:middle line:90%
And he's fighting against that.

00:12:34.748 --> 00:12:35.622 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my god.

00:12:35.622 --> 00:12:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Ironically,
that happens to him.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.084 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The great irony--

00:12:38.084 --> 00:12:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --because that is what
you've been saying all along.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Once you turn yourself over,
especially surgery-- what?--

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.000 align:middle line:84%
that the doctors'
care or mistakes--

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.482 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to
call it-- is-- what?--

00:12:50.482 --> 00:12:52.440 align:middle line:84%
the third leading cause
of death in the US now.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Third
leading cause of death.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:54.905 align:middle line:84%
First leading cause of
death is heart attack.

00:12:54.905 --> 00:12:56.960 align:middle line:90%
700,000 people die every year.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Cancer-- 500,000
people die every year.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And 200,000 people die every
year from doctors' errors.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:84%
So this man, who went after
you, died of doctors' error

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:06.900 align:middle line:90%
on the table.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes, on the table.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.640 align:middle line:84%
The irony of it, the
serendipity of it--

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.430 align:middle line:84%
I didn't wish
anything against him.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.120 align:middle line:84%
But you know, the universe
works in fascinating ways.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it is amazing.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:20.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I would like to
get a little more now

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.420 align:middle line:90%
into what happened.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.010 align:middle line:84%
I know there's
some other doctors

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I have a tremendous amount of
respect for who have ended up

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.530 align:middle line:90%
on the quack list as well.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.780 align:middle line:84%
In fact, probably most of
them I have a lot of respect

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.390 align:middle line:84%
for are somewhere
on the quack list.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: By the way,
if you go to Quackwatch

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:38.395 align:middle line:84%
on the internet, and you
Google my name into it,

00:13:38.395 --> 00:13:39.770 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that
I got sanctioned

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.140 align:middle line:90%
for illegible handwriting.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.277 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:42.277 --> 00:13:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to go on
that part of the journey.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've talked a
little bit about how

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:47.890 align:middle line:90%
the system is structured.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.780 align:middle line:84%
But I want to talk about
your particular case

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.060 align:middle line:84%
so people can see just
how crazy it gets.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what happened
initially with you?

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.190 align:middle line:90%
Where did the trouble begin?

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: The trouble
began-- a patient came in to me

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:03.570 align:middle line:84%
with a severe iritis, a
severe problem with one eye.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And he had been to six doctors
who could not fix that.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And I did my treatments using
what's called neural therapy.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.470 align:middle line:10%
I used my formulas.

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:14.070 align:middle line:10%
And I injected behind they
eye a standard thing that's

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.100 align:middle line:10%
done in Europe.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.360 align:middle line:10%
In 24 hours, he was better.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.290 align:middle line:10%
So he calls up the
physicians to tell them

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:21.790 align:middle line:10%
the story of what happened.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.669 align:middle line:84%
Well, they got so upset
that they turned me in.

00:14:24.669 --> 00:14:26.960 align:middle line:84%
They called up the medical
board to tell them about me.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.769 align:middle line:84%
So the medical board
comes after to me

00:14:28.769 --> 00:14:30.310 align:middle line:84%
to bring up charges
against me that I

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:33.610 align:middle line:84%
cured a person with
an illegal means.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:34.900 align:middle line:90%
No one asked me.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.400 align:middle line:84%
The head of the
board said, we don't

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.549 align:middle line:84%
care if your patients are
getting better or worse.

00:14:38.549 --> 00:14:40.590 align:middle line:84%
We only care if you're
doing the work in our way,

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:41.620 align:middle line:90%
scientifically.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.330 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
die in our hands.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.045 align:middle line:84%
But don't you dare get better
in a way we don't know.

00:14:46.045 --> 00:14:47.480 align:middle line:90%
It was unbelievable.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.219 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, were you actually
surprised at this at the time?

00:14:50.219 --> 00:14:51.052 align:middle line:90%
Were you that naive?

00:14:51.052 --> 00:14:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: I was stunned.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.750 align:middle line:90%
I was that naive then.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:55.200 align:middle line:90%
I knew they were-- we had a law.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.380 align:middle line:90%
We set it up.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.150 align:middle line:84%
There were things I
knew they were after.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:04.554 align:middle line:84%
But I never-- this was a case
that I did a great job on, OK?

00:15:04.554 --> 00:15:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How heartbreaking.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.016 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that has to be
totally heartbreaking.

00:15:08.016 --> 00:15:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And then to have to
pay a price for it.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.680 align:middle line:90%
What was the price?

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.015 align:middle line:90%
How did the rest of it go?

00:15:12.015 --> 00:15:14.420 align:middle line:90%
Because I know you were audited.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: It starts off
as, I'm legal in Arizona.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Even if I lose a medical
license in Arizona,

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.590 align:middle line:84%
I still have a
homeopathic license

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.190 align:middle line:84%
that allows me to
do a lot of things.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:29.150 align:middle line:84%
So the next thing I know, I get
a random Medicare audit, OK?

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.717 align:middle line:84%
Every year, they
randomly audit 3% of--

00:15:31.717 --> 00:15:32.675 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --physicians.

00:15:32.675 --> 00:15:34.008 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: --physicians, right.

00:15:34.008 --> 00:15:39.090 align:middle line:84%
They then randomly pick 28
cases out of my 3,000 files.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Now I got a little suspicious
on this, because those 28 cases

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.810 align:middle line:84%
only involve something
called chelation therapy,

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.204 align:middle line:84%
something I had never
done in my entire career.

00:15:47.204 --> 00:15:49.620 align:middle line:84%
However, I had a guy that
worked with me for three months.

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.328 align:middle line:90%
And he did those.

00:15:50.328 --> 00:15:52.660 align:middle line:90%
Those are his 28 cases.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.695 align:middle line:84%
Ergo, impossible to
be a random pick.

00:15:54.695 --> 00:15:55.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not random.

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: The only 28
cases of my 3,000 files

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.220 align:middle line:90%
they pick out to audit.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now
what was the bug

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.070 align:middle line:90%
about chelation at the time?

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:06.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how were they're
using this to discredit you?

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.220 align:middle line:90%
Was it under scrutiny?

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.303 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: There was a
big chelation organization

00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:12.050 align:middle line:90%
who was under scrutiny.

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:14.225 align:middle line:84%
By the way, 22 members
of that organization,

00:16:14.225 --> 00:16:17.600 align:middle line:84%
the American Academy of
Chelation Therapy, 22 members

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:23.691 align:middle line:84%
got the same random audit,
which is very interesting, OK?

00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Random, right?

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:25.689 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: It's random.

00:16:25.689 --> 00:16:27.200 align:middle line:84%
What's very
frightening is to pick

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.500 align:middle line:84%
those 28 cases out of
my 3,000 files, that

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.060 align:middle line:84%
means they're looking at the
codes and they're spying on me.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:33.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:35.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: If they're
spying on me here,

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.300 align:middle line:90%
they're spying on you there.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.056 align:middle line:90%
They're spying on you there, OK?

00:16:38.056 --> 00:16:39.430 align:middle line:84%
This is not just
one thing, which

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:41.795 align:middle line:90%
is very, very frightening.

00:16:41.795 --> 00:16:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So at
what point-- what

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:48.090 align:middle line:84%
did it take before you actually
lost your medical license?

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, they
kept on coming after me.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And they eventually
convicted me.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:58.860 align:middle line:84%
They indicted me on 117
counts of Medicare fraud,

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:03.260 align:middle line:84%
totalling $3,500,
totalling $3,500.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So like
$10 here and there

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:08.609 align:middle line:84%
they said were fraudulently
charged against the system?

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:10.866 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: I mean,
like my business--

00:17:10.866 --> 00:17:12.740 align:middle line:84%
I had eight practitioners--
we did $5 million

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:17.150 align:middle line:84%
worth of business in
that time. $3,500, OK?

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And 117 cases.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: And 117 cases, yes.

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.106 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're talking
roughly $30 a case.

00:17:23.106 --> 00:17:24.230 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what was happening?

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:25.313 align:middle line:90%
What was the office doing?

00:17:25.313 --> 00:17:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Was it overcharging on
faxing charges or something?

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Or what was really
going on there?

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: No, we were
just checking off the codes,

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:37.462 align:middle line:84%
trying to help the
people, plain and simple.

00:17:37.462 --> 00:17:39.670 align:middle line:84%
What's the closest code, an
office visit or something

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:40.750 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.930 align:middle line:90%
But they were just watching.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.720 align:middle line:90%
They knew who I was.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.845 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So it's not hard.

00:17:45.845 --> 00:17:47.852 align:middle line:84%
If you're going
after someone, you

00:17:47.852 --> 00:17:49.560 align:middle line:84%
can look at those tick
boxes and say, oh,

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.670 align:middle line:84%
was it necessary
to tick that box?

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And it'll total maybe
$20 or $30 or something,

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:54.800 align:middle line:90%
part of a service.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:55.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: That's right.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.411 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's what happened.

00:17:56.411 --> 00:17:59.330 align:middle line:84%
So how long had you been
in practice at this point?

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.847 align:middle line:84%
You had quite a thriving
practice is my understanding.

00:18:01.847 --> 00:18:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Oh, I
had a huge practice.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And, like I said, eight
practitioners worked under me.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.940 align:middle line:90%
There was 20 staff.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.570 align:middle line:84%
I was booked up several
months in advance.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:16.690 align:middle line:84%
The business was doing a couple
million dollars a year almost,

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:18.230 align:middle line:90%
grossing, OK?

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:21.914 align:middle line:84%
So that was big for them to come
after me for that little money.

00:18:21.914 --> 00:18:22.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: For
that little money.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.823 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They had
to look pretty hard

00:18:24.823 --> 00:18:26.800 align:middle line:84%
to even find that
much out of 117 cases.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.550 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Right.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:31.324 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So obviously
there was clear intent.

00:18:31.324 --> 00:18:32.740 align:middle line:84%
They were going
to find something.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.281 align:middle line:84%
And they were going
to take you down.

00:18:34.281 --> 00:18:36.450 align:middle line:84%
What happened, once
you lost your license,

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:37.695 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the practice?

00:18:37.695 --> 00:18:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, totally, I
was thrown out of the country.

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.780 align:middle line:90%
I had nothing.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.825 align:middle line:90%
So I went to Mexico.

00:18:42.825 --> 00:18:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And I opened up a
cancer clinic in Mexico.

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.340 align:middle line:84%
You can do anything
you want down there.

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And Baja California
is a free trade zone.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.490 align:middle line:84%
So I got a Mexican
doctor to help front me,

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:54.570 align:middle line:90%
to tell you honestly.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
you could work

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:57.540 align:middle line:84%
with your European remedies
and all the avant garde things

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.480 align:middle line:90%
that you were accustomed to.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Right.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it was a
blessing in disguise.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd get cases that
were given up by everyone.

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:09.555 align:middle line:84%
So I had my own human
population, almost,

00:19:09.555 --> 00:19:10.180 align:middle line:90%
of Guinea pigs.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.636 align:middle line:90%
Because they were all given up.

00:19:12.636 --> 00:19:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And now I had living in an
area that I could get remedies

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:17.149 align:middle line:84%
from all around the
world in a free trade

00:19:17.149 --> 00:19:18.690 align:middle line:84%
zone, which is
absolutely incredible.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.530 align:middle line:84%
So I can start to
look at different ways

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:22.040 align:middle line:90%
to go after that.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And starting to teach people,
it was almost a human Guinea pig

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:25.780 align:middle line:90%
population.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Because you could
do no harm to them.

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:28.040 align:middle line:90%
They were already basically--

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They'd been written
off by the establishment.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yeah.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.590 align:middle line:84%
They had eight toes
in the grave already.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:32.680 align:middle line:90%
Anything that I can do--

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And did you
have a good percentage

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:34.660 align:middle line:90%
at turning that around?

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.350 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:38.050 align:middle line:90%
We had a cure rate.

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:41.360 align:middle line:84%
We developed, really, honestly,
100% turnaround of prostate

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.350 align:middle line:84%
cancer almost no matter
what the stage it was.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Breast cancer, on the first
three stages of breast cancer,

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.590 align:middle line:84%
we were pretty close to
100% turnaround on those

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:55.100 align:middle line:84%
also, the ones that were
hormonally positive.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:59.064 align:middle line:84%
So our cancer-- we had, I
tell people, a cure rate, OK?

00:19:59.064 --> 00:20:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you can't say
that as an MD in the US.

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.360 align:middle line:84%
You are not allowed to
really cure anything.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: No.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.700 align:middle line:84%
You're not allowed
to use the word cure,

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.680 align:middle line:84%
because you're giving
that person false hope.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.920 align:middle line:84%
So I was told very
specifically in medical school,

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.724 align:middle line:84%
never use the word cure
in front of a patient, OK?

00:20:12.724 --> 00:20:14.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how
hopeful is that?

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:17.350 align:middle line:84%
When you start looking at the
mind body connection, the need

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.860 align:middle line:84%
for us to feel that there's
a hope that we are going

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.500 align:middle line:84%
to find a cure for
whatever it is,

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.190 align:middle line:84%
it robs you that
right off if you're

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:24.519 align:middle line:90%
in a relationship with an MD.

00:20:24.519 --> 00:20:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: That's right.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't
have that hope.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: They rob you.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.330 align:middle line:84%
They don't believe in
a mind-body connection.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:29.996 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:29.996 --> 00:20:30.970 align:middle line:90%
No, I understand that.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:34.850 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: All disease, by
them, is a virus or a gene,

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:37.850 align:middle line:84%
or you're allergic to yourself--
autoimmune they call it, OK?

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Everything they can't
find has got to be-- maybe

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:41.710 align:middle line:90%
we'll find a virus.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Because there's got to be
some small invisible thing

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:44.463 align:middle line:90%
that's invading you.

00:20:44.463 --> 00:20:48.026 align:middle line:84%
So they're always
looking for a virus.

00:20:48.026 --> 00:20:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Like, I had a case
the other day.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.430 align:middle line:90%
They came into the clinic.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.660 align:middle line:90%
And he was autoimmune, you know?

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.105 align:middle line:84%
It was his fault
that he's ill, OK?

00:20:56.105 --> 00:20:57.605 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever see a
deer in the forest

00:20:57.605 --> 00:20:59.260 align:middle line:84%
you believe is
allergic to itself?

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.137 align:middle line:84%
Do you think the creator made
anyone allergic to themselves?

00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:02.803 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Something's
wrong there.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.386 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
something's wrong.

00:21:05.386 --> 00:21:07.666 align:middle line:84%
So there's definitely
a corruption there.

00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:09.040 align:middle line:84%
OK, let me read
something to you,

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.450 align:middle line:84%
because we were talking about
you were not just censored.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:13.870 align:middle line:84%
You were stripped
of your license.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.300 align:middle line:90%
You went south of the border.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Over $3,500 in supposed Medicare
fraud for over 117 cases.

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:22.630 align:middle line:90%
At the same time, Bill Frist--

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:23.505 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:21:23.505 --> 00:21:24.230 align:middle line:90%
I was going to mentioned that.

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, that's what I--

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.601 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: By the
way, we negotiated

00:21:26.601 --> 00:21:28.200 align:middle line:90%
to a $145 conviction.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.130 align:middle line:90%
What was by the way.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:32.605 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 140-- so
basically $1 a case.

00:21:32.605 --> 00:21:33.105 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:33.105 --> 00:21:33.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Right.

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:34.203 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:21:34.203 --> 00:21:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: At the same
time, Senator Bill Frist

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:39.440 align:middle line:84%
opened up a series of
HMOs around the country.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And he was given a
Medicare fraud misdemeanor

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.790 align:middle line:90%
for $1.7 billion dollars.

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And he paid it
off in two checks.

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yours was a
felony for $145 negotiated.

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:57.170 align:middle line:84%
His was a misdemeanor for
$1.7 billion in fraud?

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:58.654 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes.

00:21:58.654 --> 00:22:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he didn't-- well,
of course, he's not an MD.

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So they can't strip
him of anything.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: It was his
clinics and everything.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:04.770 align:middle line:90%
He had the HMOs.

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:05.680 align:middle line:90%
It was his show.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.370 align:middle line:84%
And, like I said, he paid
it off in two checks,

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.201 align:middle line:84%
two separate checks
for $1.7 billion.

00:22:10.201 --> 00:22:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, he's clearly
better connected than you were.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:13.580 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, Senator Bill
Frist is a cardiologist.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.012 align:middle line:84%
He worked as a
cardiovascular surgeon.

00:22:19.012 --> 00:22:20.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did have a
license at the time?

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: I believe so.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did he
lose his license?

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.265 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: No.

00:22:23.265 --> 00:22:24.990 align:middle line:84%
He just probably
doesn't use it anymore.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't think-- I think
he's still got a license.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he wasn't even--
just on the ceremony of it

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.593 align:middle line:90%
alone, he wasn't-- no.

00:22:31.593 --> 00:22:32.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:33.720 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.690 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to
bring that up just

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:38.120 align:middle line:84%
to show how it's not
really a very equal system

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.410 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to all these
random audits and so forth.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:41.201 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: No way.

00:22:41.201 --> 00:22:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you
are an MD and you

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.870 align:middle line:84%
want to go outside
of the box, you've

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:49.230 align:middle line:84%
learned of some other fabulous
complementary therapies-- which

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:52.600 align:middle line:84%
is a good way to put a lot
of it-- what can you do?

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.030 align:middle line:84%
What are you allowed
to do as an MD?

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:58.074 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, apparantly
not allowed to cure a person.

00:22:58.074 --> 00:22:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're what?

00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Not allowed
to cure a person.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.423 align:middle line:84%
I got to go back to that,
because that's not used.

00:23:02.423 --> 00:23:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: What
am I allowed to do?

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:07.530 align:middle line:84%
What would you be
allowed to do if you

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:08.779 align:middle line:90%
want to go outside of the box?

00:23:08.779 --> 00:23:10.945 align:middle line:90%


00:23:10.945 --> 00:23:12.445 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Most
of the stuff that I

00:23:12.445 --> 00:23:13.760 align:middle line:90%
got were natural from Europe.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of the stuff
that I got was legal.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:18.180 align:middle line:84%
The biggest thing that
I tell people-- you

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:19.431 align:middle line:90%
know, you can do those things.

00:23:19.431 --> 00:23:21.013 align:middle line:84%
Under your license,
theoretically, you

00:23:21.013 --> 00:23:21.875 align:middle line:90%
can do those things.

00:23:21.875 --> 00:23:23.810 align:middle line:90%
Just don't tell anyone.

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Yeah
Well, there you go.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Don't tell anyone.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.244 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I mean, what
happens when someone comes in,

00:23:27.244 --> 00:23:30.315 align:middle line:84%
maybe if they're looking,
sending someone in

00:23:30.315 --> 00:23:31.572 align:middle line:90%
to check on you?

00:23:31.572 --> 00:23:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: My biggest
problem ended up--

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.330 align:middle line:84%
there are people that get away
with the alternative people.

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Most alternative
people are hiding.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.065 align:middle line:90%
They're afraid, OK?

00:23:39.065 --> 00:23:42.510 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid that something's
going to go on with them.

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And I just tell people
now, one of my problems

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.895 align:middle line:90%
was that I was a big mouth.

00:23:46.895 --> 00:23:48.260 align:middle line:90%
I came out and said it.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.510 align:middle line:84%
I tell the people,
no, just don't

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.980 align:middle line:84%
go out in front of the
cameras and spout your things

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.340 align:middle line:90%
and call the AMA ridiculous.

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:56.619 align:middle line:90%
Because they will get you.

00:23:56.619 --> 00:23:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:57.880 align:middle line:90%
So stay quite.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.050 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to do
it, stay under the radar.

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:02.050 align:middle line:84%
What is the function
of naturopaths?

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:05.200 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people don't
understand what a naturopath is

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.700 align:middle line:84%
compared to an M.D. What is one
allowed to do versus the other?

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: First of
all, the naturopaths

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:14.150 align:middle line:84%
are licensed in-- I
think only in 17 states.

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:17.430 align:middle line:84%
But they're allowed to give
almost all types of treatments.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:19.470 align:middle line:84%
They can write certain
prescriptions also

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:20.340 align:middle line:90%
in those states.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:23.930 align:middle line:84%
But they're into the
body's chemistry.

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:26.145 align:middle line:84%
They're into the pHs of
the body, the control

00:24:26.145 --> 00:24:28.416 align:middle line:84%
over the body, keeping
the body healthy.

00:24:28.416 --> 00:24:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's where
you might find chelation,

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:31.580 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.251 align:middle line:90%
You might find IV therapies.

00:24:33.251 --> 00:24:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: You'll find
a lot IV therapies a lot

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:37.024 align:middle line:84%
times with naturopathic
physicians, yes.

00:24:37.024 --> 00:24:37.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:38.315 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: OK.

00:24:38.315 --> 00:24:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And they're controlling
the pHs in the body.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And they're really into
the cell metabolism,

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:45.980 align:middle line:90%
getting the body healthy.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.530 align:middle line:84%
They're not into
disease, but as much

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.065 align:middle line:84%
as how can they make the body
healthier and perform better?

00:24:50.065 --> 00:24:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
happens if you choose

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.110 align:middle line:84%
to go to a naturopathic
school of medicine?

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:56.065 align:middle line:90%
Is it a similar process?

00:24:56.065 --> 00:24:56.690 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Same number of
hours, years, et cetera?

00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:58.934 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yeah.

00:24:58.934 --> 00:24:59.260 align:middle line:90%
It's many years.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a goal of
mine would be actually

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.220 align:middle line:84%
to teach by work in a
naturopathic school,

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.050 align:middle line:84%
because I think they
would understand

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:06.160 align:middle line:90%
all the natural work.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.510 align:middle line:84%
But you're looking at
probably five years

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:09.150 align:middle line:84%
of schooling,
postgraduate schooling.

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:10.525 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Postgraduate
schooling.

00:25:10.525 --> 00:25:13.940 align:middle line:84%
So really it's a
totally different board

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.550 align:middle line:84%
that would certify
the naturopaths?

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:16.924 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes, yes.

00:25:16.924 --> 00:25:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so my
understanding there also--

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.530 align:middle line:84%
naturopathic practitioners,
which is not exactly the same

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:23.790 align:middle line:90%
as a naturopath--

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:25.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: I'm
not sure of that.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A couple
of people have

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:27.880 align:middle line:84%
said they didn't go
through the full training.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.713 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, how can
you not go through it

00:25:29.713 --> 00:25:30.610 align:middle line:90%
and be a naturopath.

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:32.592 align:middle line:84%
So to be a naturopath,
you have to have

00:25:32.592 --> 00:25:34.300 align:middle line:84%
gone through the same
four or five years.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: You have
to get that diploma.

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:35.055 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:35.055 --> 00:25:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: You have to
pass all the tests, yes.

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:40.900 align:middle line:84%
So in a little bit, we're
going to talk about some

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.260 align:middle line:84%
of the avant garde
therapies you've been using.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And I really want to get
into stem cell therapy.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Because this is something
that I think people,

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.000 align:middle line:84%
they hear whispers
of it on the news.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.125 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, President
Bush, President Obama

00:25:53.125 --> 00:25:56.239 align:middle line:84%
says we're going to basically
allow stem cell therapy

00:25:56.239 --> 00:25:58.030 align:middle line:84%
to start taking place
in the United States.

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.067 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes away,
comes back, and so forth.

00:26:00.067 --> 00:26:01.650 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that you've actually

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:84%
spent a fair amount
of time with.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes, I have.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:08.190 align:middle line:10%
I've used stem cell work
now for about 10 years, OK?

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:12.350 align:middle line:10%
The French are making stem
cells from pigs that you drink.

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:16.200 align:middle line:10%
Pigs and humans have
very similar genetics.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So those stem cells you
get through the membranes

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.880 align:middle line:84%
of the mouth, I can import
them and deal with them.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.942 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now can you, as
an MD, could any MD do this?

00:26:23.942 --> 00:26:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Or because you're outside
of the law right now,

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.140 align:middle line:90%
it allows you to do that?

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.431 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Any MD can do this.

00:26:28.431 --> 00:26:31.365 align:middle line:84%
I get the product from a
distributor in Florida.

00:26:31.365 --> 00:26:32.189 align:middle line:90%
Any MD can do this.

00:26:32.189 --> 00:26:33.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
is it that Congress

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:35.271 align:middle line:84%
keeps going back
and forth about then

00:26:35.271 --> 00:26:36.730 align:middle line:90%
regarding stem cell therapy?

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Is it more an
ethical issue having

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:40.804 align:middle line:84%
to do with the source
of the stem cells?

00:26:40.804 --> 00:26:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: They're looking
at stem cells only in one way.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.719 align:middle line:84%
They're looking at
one way-- if you

00:26:44.719 --> 00:26:47.010 align:middle line:84%
have a problem with the brain,
getting brain stem cells

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:48.220 align:middle line:90%
and drilling it into the skull.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.553 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking at standards
and that type of thing.

00:26:50.553 --> 00:26:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see OK.

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: The French make it.

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:53.860 align:middle line:90%
You can drink it like this, OK?

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.520 align:middle line:84%
But the United States is looking
at everything Las Vegas style.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.620 align:middle line:84%
They know stem cells
are regenerating things.

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what it is is
if you're 55 years old,

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:05.530 align:middle line:84%
every day, old cells are dying
and being born at 55, OK?

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:08.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But in stem cells,
you come back younger.

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:10.090 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about that and talk

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:11.814 align:middle line:84%
about the various
conditions you've

00:27:11.814 --> 00:27:12.980 align:middle line:90%
worked with with stem cells.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.940 align:middle line:84%
So we'll be back in just
a couple of minutes.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:21.484 align:middle line:10%

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.870 align:middle line:10%

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.699 align:middle line:84%
around the world for other
exclusive interviews.

00:28:42.699 --> 00:28:44.740 align:middle line:10%
>>BIGELSEN: You've got
pharmaceutical commercials

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:46.560 align:middle line:10%
telling you, go to
see your doctor this,

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.650 align:middle line:10%
go to tell your doctor that.

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:49.782 align:middle line:10%
It's a brain washing.

00:28:49.782 --> 00:28:51.490 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Meanwhile,
I wanted to give you

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:54.290 align:middle line:10%
a quick preview of
gaimtv.com so you

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:56.190 align:middle line:10%
can see what's being
made available for you

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:57.752 align:middle line:10%
as a result of this partnership.

00:28:57.752 --> 00:28:59.710 align:middle line:10%
>>MICHAEL TELLINGER: This
is in the late 1400s.

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:02.190 align:middle line:10%
When they asked the
local African tribes who

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:05.670 align:middle line:10%
built these structures, the
answer was, we don't know.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is not what you'll
read in history books today.

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:09.689 align:middle line:90%
I have a big problem with that.

00:29:09.689 --> 00:29:11.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'll find
curated consciousness

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.240 align:middle line:84%
expanding films, thought
provoking documentaries,

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:19.600 align:middle line:84%
engaging TV shows,
and much more.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.995 align:middle line:84%
Please join us for the next
evolution of conscious media.

00:29:22.995 --> 00:29:27.679 align:middle line:90%


00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:33.929 align:middle line:10%
[BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:29:33.929 --> 00:29:34.970 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK, we're back.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:37.480 align:middle line:10%
And we're talking about
stem cell therapy.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.570 align:middle line:10%
Harvey's been working with stem
cells for about a decade now.

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:43.510 align:middle line:10%
Now, did you have
to originally do

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:46.680 align:middle line:10%
this through Brownsville
or out of Mexico?

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.097 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Yeah,
I had to do it--

00:29:48.097 --> 00:29:50.305 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Brownsville, Texas,
which is a border town.

00:29:50.305 --> 00:29:51.810 align:middle line:10%
>>BIGELSEN: What
I had to do is--

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:55.420 align:middle line:10%
I found some people
in Mexico that

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.720 align:middle line:10%
were using human stem cells, OK?

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.470 align:middle line:10%
And I contacted them.

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And I had a gal that
was autistic, OK?

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:04.664 align:middle line:84%
And she quote,
"had Lyme disease."

00:30:04.664 --> 00:30:05.830 align:middle line:90%
But she was really autistic.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.620 align:middle line:84%
It was really an
interesting case.

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:09.620 align:middle line:84%
She was crying and
always had her head down

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:12.770 align:middle line:84%
and just banging her head
against the wall 23 hours

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:14.520 align:middle line:90%
a day type of thing.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And we brought her
down to Mexico.

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first time
we tried human stem cells.

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And I had a group of
seven of us, actually.

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:22.381 align:middle line:90%
We all did.

00:30:22.381 --> 00:30:23.630 align:middle line:90%
It was very, very fascinating.

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:24.045 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Seven what?

00:30:24.045 --> 00:30:24.885 align:middle line:90%
Who were the others?

00:30:24.885 --> 00:30:26.093 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: There were seven.

00:30:26.093 --> 00:30:27.705 align:middle line:90%
I tried it myself.

00:30:27.705 --> 00:30:30.920 align:middle line:90%
I believe my wife tried them.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.200 align:middle line:84%
There with some other
case that I had.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
interesting what we did.

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:37.497 align:middle line:84%
Each one, I took
the blood before.

00:30:37.497 --> 00:30:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I took a drop of blood before
and I took a drop of blood

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:40.260 align:middle line:90%
afterwards.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:41.551 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let me just say this.

00:30:41.551 --> 00:30:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Because if you didn't see the
first interview with Harvey,

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Harvey does dark
field microscopy.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a type of live blood
cell analysis, which

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:52.835 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely phenomenal
because it's instantaneous.

00:30:52.835 --> 00:30:54.960 align:middle line:84%
You can see right where
your body is in the moment.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's what he's
talking about when you're

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.100 align:middle line:84%
talking about you took the
drop of blood and looked at it.

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.433 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: I took the drop
of blood of everyone before.

00:31:01.433 --> 00:31:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Then I took the drop of
blood of everyone afterwards.

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:05.890 align:middle line:90%
And it was so fascinating.

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Everyone reacted in
their own unique way.

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:12.650 align:middle line:84%
My white count tends to be
high because as a little child

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:14.149 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of
surgeries and there's

00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:15.930 align:middle line:84%
a lot of inflammation
in my body.

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:17.920 align:middle line:90%
My white count dropped down.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Other people's, whose
white counts were low

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.370 align:middle line:84%
and their immune system wasn't
as strong as that, whatever

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:24.560 align:middle line:84%
it is, their white
counts went up.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Everyone reacted
in a different way.

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:31.129 align:middle line:84%
And it was so interesting
that when everyone got the IV,

00:31:31.129 --> 00:31:32.420 align:middle line:90%
it hit them in a different way.

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Some people-- oh,
my knee got it.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:38.110 align:middle line:84%
This gal got a headache
immediately, my autistic gal.

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Everyone got-- wherever
their weak spot was,

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:44.370 align:middle line:84%
they felt something
happen to them.

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:46.600 align:middle line:90%
That was so fascinating.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:51.030 align:middle line:84%
The autistic gal was
over the next night.

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:53.380 align:middle line:84%
She was talking at dinner,
just blah, blah blah.

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:54.677 align:middle line:90%
She was going a mile a minute.

00:31:54.677 --> 00:31:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From stem cells.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.640 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: From the stem cells.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this was
just one dose or treatment?

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:00.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: One dose.

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:05.240 align:middle line:84%
That autistic gal just recently
graduated from UC Davis, OK?

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:08.810 align:middle line:84%
She was locked up in a home,
completely lost and everything.

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:10.260 align:middle line:90%
She's absolutely brilliant.

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:13.605 align:middle line:84%
And I think she's going
to become a naturopath

00:32:13.605 --> 00:32:16.091 align:middle line:84%
and go on and do the work
because that work changed

00:32:16.091 --> 00:32:16.590 align:middle line:90%
her life.

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:17.173 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:32:17.173 --> 00:32:19.010 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's really phenomenal.

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:24.470 align:middle line:84%
So when you say that you're
taking live cells, live stem

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:29.430 align:middle line:84%
cells that are still in their
young and perfected condition,

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:31.520 align:middle line:84%
in this case, you
were using human?

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And really that's
been a big part

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:36.770 align:middle line:84%
of the debate is the
sourcing of the stem

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:38.210 align:middle line:90%
cells more than anything else.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:39.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, can you talk about that?

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:40.481 align:middle line:90%
Because people hear stem cells.

00:32:40.481 --> 00:32:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they see these
advertisements

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:45.170 align:middle line:90%
that have dead fetuses and such.

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:46.690 align:middle line:90%
And let's talk about that.

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: You can get
them from fetal tissue.

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:50.319 align:middle line:84%
You can get them from umbilical
tissue, which I really

00:32:50.319 --> 00:32:51.750 align:middle line:90%
think is the livelier cells.

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:54.410 align:middle line:84%
The cells in the umbilical
area are actually

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:56.220 align:middle line:90%
starting to differentiate.

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:56.970 align:middle line:90%
They make those.

00:32:56.970 --> 00:33:00.850 align:middle line:90%
I like those the best of all.

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:01.510 align:middle line:90%
I've used them.

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Lately, I've been
using the animal tissue

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:06.662 align:middle line:84%
because in the United States,
you really can't do stem cell.

00:33:06.662 --> 00:33:07.870 align:middle line:90%
That's why we went to Mexico.

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.320 align:middle line:90%
You can't do human stem cells.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Right.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.031 align:middle line:84%
In the United States, that's
why we use the French stem

00:33:13.031 --> 00:33:15.430 align:middle line:90%
cells that you drink, OK.

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so first of
all, the umbilical stem cells,

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.220 align:middle line:90%
how does one procure those?

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:24.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know that
in terms of shamanism,

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.660 align:middle line:90%
the umbilical cord is sacred.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:27.944 align:middle line:90%
It's a sacred life form.

00:33:27.944 --> 00:33:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: They're actually
taking fetal umbilical tissue

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:33.920 align:middle line:84%
cells and growing
them on plates.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.365 align:middle line:84%
And the cells now
our regenerating

00:33:36.365 --> 00:33:38.660 align:middle line:90%
at their rate, whatever it is.

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.030 align:middle line:90%
You've got brain cells in there.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:41.071 align:middle line:90%
It's not forming a brain.

00:33:41.071 --> 00:33:42.825 align:middle line:84%
But it's forming
at a certain stage.

00:33:42.825 --> 00:33:45.110 align:middle line:84%
If I can take those
cells and give it to you,

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:47.300 align:middle line:84%
it now makes your brain
start to work better.

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so they're
differentiated enough

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.749 align:middle line:84%
that they target that
specific part of your being.

00:33:52.749 --> 00:33:54.040 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: That specific part.

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.190 align:middle line:84%
I had one case that
was so interesting.

00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:59.350 align:middle line:84%
I was treating this-- I
had this woman patient.

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:01.120 align:middle line:90%
And her mother had Alzheimer's.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And she would take her
mother around every place.

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.166 align:middle line:84%
Her mother was sitting
out in the waiting room

00:34:05.166 --> 00:34:07.812 align:middle line:84%
So I brought the woman patient
in before I stopped a second.

00:34:07.812 --> 00:34:08.520 align:middle line:90%
Give me a second.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.473 align:middle line:90%
I had a thought.

00:34:09.473 --> 00:34:10.139 align:middle line:90%
And I went over.

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:13.409 align:middle line:84%
I grabbed a cc of
human brain-- of pig

00:34:13.409 --> 00:34:15.520 align:middle line:90%
stem cells for the brain.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:19.124 align:middle line:84%
And I gave her a cc
of that and just told

00:34:19.124 --> 00:34:20.290 align:middle line:90%
her to hold it in her mouth.

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:21.250 align:middle line:90%
And we went in.

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:23.275 align:middle line:90%
And I took care of the daughter.

00:34:23.275 --> 00:34:26.090 align:middle line:84%
We came out an hour
later and came back.

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And the mother looks at me and
says, Dr. Bigelsen, what am I

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:29.429 align:middle line:90%
doing here?

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:31.345 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that a good
thing or a bad thing?

00:34:31.345 --> 00:34:33.449 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: She
recognized me, OK?

00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:35.247 align:middle line:84%
And she hadn't done
that in over a year.

00:34:35.247 --> 00:34:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she didn't know how
she had been teleported there

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.790 align:middle line:84%
or why she was even
in your office.

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: That's right,
why she was even there.

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.356 align:middle line:84%
But the stem cells
brought her there.

00:34:42.356 --> 00:34:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And right then and there,
she got cleared up.

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:45.969 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
was in an hour?

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:46.660 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Within an hour, yes.

00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:47.743 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Within and hour.

00:34:47.743 --> 00:34:51.469 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: These things
get into the blood so fast.

00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:55.132 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I said when they
did the IV ones, everyone--

00:34:55.132 --> 00:34:57.340 align:middle line:84%
if you had a problem in the
head, you got a headache.

00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:58.310 align:middle line:90%
You had a problem in the knee.

00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:59.143 align:middle line:90%
You had a knee ache.

00:34:59.143 --> 00:35:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Everyone had their own
thing with the IV ones.

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:05.690 align:middle line:84%
I was stunned that the oral ones
get in there that fast also.

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so you
said you're using

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:08.830 align:middle line:90%
porcine, which is pig DNA.

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yeah.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it identical
enough to human DNA

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:13.532 align:middle line:90%
that it's targeting?

00:35:13.532 --> 00:35:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: It's the closest.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.455 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
what is the success

00:35:16.455 --> 00:35:18.664 align:middle line:90%
rate of porcine versus human?

00:35:18.664 --> 00:35:20.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, first of
all, human you can't use.

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:21.920 align:middle line:90%
That's the biggest one.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean,
you had in the past

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.980 align:middle line:90%
in Mexico a little bit.

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.685 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: I only used
a little bit of it.

00:35:25.685 --> 00:35:27.434 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so it's
mostly been porcine.

00:35:27.434 --> 00:35:29.630 align:middle line:84%
These cases you're talking
about are mostly porcine?

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Porcine, yeah,
mostly the pig cells.

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Pig and human are very
similar genetically.

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:37.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's mostly those
that I'm using now,

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.824 align:middle line:84%
because that I can use
in the United States.

00:35:39.824 --> 00:35:41.240 align:middle line:84%
We can use those,
because I buy it

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.280 align:middle line:84%
from a distributor
in the United States.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And the FDA lets it in because
they think it's no big deal.

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.312 align:middle line:90%
It's an oral product.

00:35:49.312 --> 00:35:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Since it's an oral product,
it's not a big deal

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:52.782 align:middle line:90%
and can't do much.

00:35:52.782 --> 00:35:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How many
people in the US,

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:56.399 align:middle line:84%
how many practitioners
are actually using these?

00:35:56.399 --> 00:35:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: I don't know.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.602 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:35:58.602 --> 00:36:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because as
you're talking about this,

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.430 align:middle line:84%
anybody listening
is going to say, oh,

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:06.140 align:middle line:84%
my father is suffering
from dementia right now.

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this brings a
lot of hope to people.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:12.300 align:middle line:90%
But where do people actually go?

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Really honestly,
if they want to find out,

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:15.960 align:middle line:90%
contact me.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.700 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And you'll
find that in their area

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:18.830 align:middle line:10%
>>BIGELSEN: And I can
see if I can find someone

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:19.902 align:middle line:10%
in their area for them.

00:36:19.902 --> 00:36:22.360 align:middle line:10%
A lot of times though, what
you got to do with stem cells--

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:23.660 align:middle line:10%
a big thing you got
to do with stem cells

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:24.750 align:middle line:10%
is you got to prep the patient.

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.370 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I was going to
ask you, when does it not work?

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:29.250 align:middle line:84%
You must have had cases
where it just didn't take.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, I found
out why it doesn't work, OK?

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: If the person's
got a problem with their lungs

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:35.400 align:middle line:84%
or something like that,
or a problem in the brain,

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.920 align:middle line:84%
or a problem in
their intestines,

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.880 align:middle line:84%
that means they're not
getting the acupuncture

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.960 align:middle line:84%
flows through, fluid and
electric circulation flows

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:42.740 align:middle line:90%
through, nothing.

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:44.364 align:middle line:84%
Things aren't getting
through properly,

00:36:44.364 --> 00:36:47.110 align:middle line:84%
so that tissue is
getting weakened, OK?

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:49.454 align:middle line:84%
What I find is when the
tissue is getting weakened,

00:36:49.454 --> 00:36:50.620 align:middle line:90%
we have to prep the patient.

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:52.900 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times it's
blocked by a scar.

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.229 align:middle line:90%
Scars will block things.

00:36:54.229 --> 00:36:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about other
kinds of trauma to the body?

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.220 align:middle line:84%
No one's got a perfect
body, plain and simple.

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.600 align:middle line:84%
That's why I tell people to
do things like yoga and stuff

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.104 align:middle line:84%
like that because really,
that's a divine exercise.

00:37:04.104 --> 00:37:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:05.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes, indeed.

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.085 align:middle line:90%
To open up all of the pathways.

00:37:07.085 --> 00:37:08.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: What I do
is open up the body.

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And the body heals
itself as best it can.

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:13.270 align:middle line:84%
So we do a lot of
structural work,

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:17.019 align:middle line:84%
a lot of classic
osteopathic work.

00:37:17.019 --> 00:37:19.560 align:middle line:84%
We do a lot of what's called go
after the disturbance fields.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.380 align:middle line:90%
Someone puts a knife in you.

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:22.620 align:middle line:90%
That blocks everything.

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:24.004 align:middle line:90%
We loosen those scars up, OK?

00:37:24.004 --> 00:37:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:26.628 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about that
in our last interview.

00:37:26.628 --> 00:37:28.880 align:middle line:84%
That's why you use the
isopathic therapies from your--

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: That's why I
use that to get that so I

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:32.160 align:middle line:84%
can get the remedies
to the area.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.880 align:middle line:84%
People have problems in an
area because they're not

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:38.420 align:middle line:84%
getting the circulation or
the acupuncture flows to it.

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:39.667 align:middle line:90%
We open them up.

00:37:39.667 --> 00:37:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, you've
got to really go up

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:44.255 align:middle line:84%
to-- go after where
the scars are,

00:37:44.255 --> 00:37:45.630 align:middle line:84%
because that's
the biggest injury

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:47.780 align:middle line:90%
in the body, some surgical scar.

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:52.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: I tell people,
a good doctor's got drool

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.510 align:middle line:84%
coming out of the mouth and
looking for your surgical scar.

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And he's got a needle behind his
back over there to open you up.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.350 align:middle line:84%
He's doing something instead of
giving you a prescription, OK?

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:03.380 align:middle line:84%
He's actually taking the
physical body, which,

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:06.280 align:middle line:84%
is to me, holy,
and opening that up

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.610 align:middle line:84%
and letting the physical
body take care of itself.

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you must have
found there were cases then.

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:14.700 align:middle line:84%
It took you a while to
make this correlation

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.231 align:middle line:84%
that if the body was blocked,
the stem cell therapy was not

00:38:17.231 --> 00:38:17.730 align:middle line:90%
working.

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Correct.

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:19.450 align:middle line:90%
It took me awhile.

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:20.390 align:middle line:90%
I know of no one.

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:22.510 align:middle line:84%
I've tried to communicate
with others on it.

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And I know of no one
that gets that point.

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.537 align:middle line:84%
If you give stem cells because
you've got a bad liver,

00:38:29.537 --> 00:38:31.370 align:middle line:84%
well, you may have had
surgery around there.

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:33.145 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to work, OK?

00:38:33.145 --> 00:38:34.520 align:middle line:84%
You've got to open
it up and make

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.340 align:middle line:84%
sure those cells
get to that liver.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.630 align:middle line:90%
That's the real key.

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:40.866 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So what are some of
the areas of stem cell research

00:38:40.866 --> 00:38:42.240 align:middle line:10%
right now that're
really hopeful.

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.240 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we hear about spinal
cord injuries, for example.

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:48.755 align:middle line:84%
That comes up a lot in
terms of stem cell therapy.

00:38:48.755 --> 00:38:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: I think the
future is stem cells.

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:53.850 align:middle line:84%
I think that's totally
the future of medicine.

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:56.130 align:middle line:10%
The United States,
though, is so far behind

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:58.140 align:middle line:10%
because it's so
pharmaceutically controlled.

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:01.200 align:middle line:10%
Unless the industry can
control it with stem cells,

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.160 align:middle line:10%
they don't want it,
because they make money

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.500 align:middle line:10%
on all the pills and
everything like that.

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:09.434 align:middle line:84%
So the US is massively behind
in research on this, OK?

00:39:09.434 --> 00:39:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who are the
leading countries?

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.550 align:middle line:84%
If someone says,
hey, I'm doing this.

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.470 align:middle line:84%
I'll leave the US and pay
out of pocket, who's really--

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:15.594 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Oh, the French.

00:39:15.594 --> 00:39:16.469 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The French.

00:39:16.469 --> 00:39:18.552 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: I tell people,
and we talked about it.

00:39:18.552 --> 00:39:20.900 align:middle line:84%
They eat like crazy, drink
like crazy, smoke like crazy.

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:21.850 align:middle line:90%
They're thin as rails.

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:23.894 align:middle line:84%
And they live five to
eight years longer than us.

00:39:23.894 --> 00:39:24.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Still?

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.160 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes, they do

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That stat's
still holding up?

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.891 align:middle line:90%
They live longer than us still?

00:39:27.891 --> 00:39:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: They live
longer than us, right.

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.250 align:middle line:90%
To me, I'm not sure.

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:36.590 align:middle line:84%
I get my stem cells
through a distributor.

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:39.230 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really not sure
that the French companies,

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:41.580 align:middle line:84%
how they found it, what
they're really doing.

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:44.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to set up a network
to get a hold of practitioners

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.290 align:middle line:84%
in Europe so we start to
coordinate a lot of this.

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And share
information with each other?

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.758 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Share
information, yes.

00:39:49.758 --> 00:39:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so underground
in North America, no

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:56.840 align:middle line:90%
one talks about it, you know?

00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:00.570 align:middle line:84%
The guy that I work
with in Mexico,

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:02.410 align:middle line:84%
he used to work in
the United States.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:04.250 align:middle line:90%
And he got arrested, OK?

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:05.920 align:middle line:90%
They were after him for that.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:09.490 align:middle line:84%
They trashed him on TV
and stuff like that.

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't heard
from him in a while.

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is there a fair
amount of stem cell therapy

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:17.320 align:middle line:84%
available down South
across the border?

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, the
beauty about Mexico, Baja

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:21.190 align:middle line:90%
is a free trade zone.

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:22.480 align:middle line:90%
So you can get anything there.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.146 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:23.146 --> 00:40:25.134 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There
are now supposedly

00:40:25.134 --> 00:40:26.550 align:middle line:84%
several different
clinics that are

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:27.930 align:middle line:90%
doing stem cell work in Baja.

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, also you've got
to realize sometimes

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:33.224 align:middle line:84%
a lot of that down in
Baja is a lot of thievery.

00:40:33.224 --> 00:40:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:34.475 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:40:34.475 --> 00:40:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: So what you
can trust in there--

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:40.860 align:middle line:84%
I saw on the internet some
of the type of stem cell

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.761 align:middle line:90%
work they're doing.

00:40:43.761 --> 00:40:46.620 align:middle line:84%
I'd have real questions
about some of that stuff.

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
stuff that I've read,

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.970 align:middle line:90%
I know they don't prep it.

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:52.540 align:middle line:84%
I do believe in Mexico, you
can get good stem cells.

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.350 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not convinced
that you can

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:57.240 align:middle line:84%
get it prepped for
the stuff like that.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.380 align:middle line:84%
If I didn't have
someone specifically

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:00.990 align:middle line:84%
to work with in
something like that--

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You
wouldn't recommend it?

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: I
wouldn't recommend it.

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:05.211 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to
be prepped, or else

00:41:05.211 --> 00:41:06.960 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
wasting a lot of money.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, when you say
a lot of money, now, what's

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.350 align:middle line:84%
the classic medical
model for stem cell?

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:16.822 align:middle line:84%
And what is that cost
compared to the stem cell

00:41:16.822 --> 00:41:18.030 align:middle line:90%
therapy you're talking about?

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:18.920 align:middle line:90%
Is there a difference?

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.365 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, you
know, right now, in the US,

00:41:20.365 --> 00:41:21.750 align:middle line:90%
you can't get stem cells.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:24.897 align:middle line:84%
And I think they're going to run
up costs tremendously on this.

00:41:24.897 --> 00:41:26.480 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking
in Mexico, any place

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.629 align:middle line:84%
between $8,000 and $15,000
for something like that.

00:41:29.629 --> 00:41:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For what?

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:32.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, a few injections, or--

00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:33.975 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: They
give you generic.

00:41:33.975 --> 00:41:37.100 align:middle line:84%
If you go down there, you
get a generic stem cell

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:39.880 align:middle line:84%
from where they got it,
what umbilical tissue.

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Some of them will take your
stem cells and send them out,

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:46.000 align:middle line:84%
and within 24, 48
hours come back.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And the stem cell will
come back with something

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:51.000 align:middle line:90%
that was just designed for you.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm not as convinced that
that is important, OK?

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you said
earlier before our little break

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.330 align:middle line:84%
that if you're 55
years old, if you're

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:02.949 align:middle line:84%
sending your own
55-year-old stem cells out,

00:42:02.949 --> 00:42:04.240 align:middle line:90%
what are you going to get back?

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:08.011 align:middle line:84%
You're not getting back that
fresh virgin baby information

00:42:08.011 --> 00:42:08.510 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:10.218 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: I want
that baby information.

00:42:10.218 --> 00:42:13.600 align:middle line:84%
I want that, where it's
not polluted with anything.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.059 align:middle line:84%
That's the information
that I want.

00:42:15.059 --> 00:42:17.099 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to get
that fetal and umbilical.

00:42:17.099 --> 00:42:18.330 align:middle line:90%
And you get that that way.

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's really--
when you're talking stem cells,

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:24.720 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about a living
matrix of information.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.554 align:middle line:90%
It's really just information.

00:42:26.554 --> 00:42:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes.

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:28.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:29.895 align:middle line:90%
And it's--

00:42:29.895 --> 00:42:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that why it
has to be from fetuses,

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:34.619 align:middle line:84%
so it's, as you say,
uncorrupted, unpolluted--

00:42:34.619 --> 00:42:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: It's about as
pure as you can get it.

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --pure information
before the corruptions of life

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.670 align:middle line:84%
happen, before the
traumas of life.

00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes, yes.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, there may be in there--
and I've had questions back

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.460 align:middle line:84%
and forth-- is the
fetal stuff also

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:50.910 align:middle line:84%
may have a representation
of the mother.

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Because the fetus
gets the mother's

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:55.670 align:middle line:84%
not only genetics, but the
mother's emotions and stuff

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:56.420 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So I have certain questions that
if there's problems in there.

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:05.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'd like
to get fetal stem

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:07.410 align:middle line:90%
cells from someone's family.

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:08.790 align:middle line:90%
Then I think it's a lot better.

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Like if you were
getting stem cells,

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:14.660 align:middle line:84%
but you had now a niece that
had a kid, that gave birth,

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:15.744 align:middle line:90%
I'd save those stem cells.

00:43:15.744 --> 00:43:17.701 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
what I was going to ask.

00:43:17.701 --> 00:43:20.270 align:middle line:84%
I thought I'd read an article
about that recently where

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:23.940 align:middle line:84%
a family was having their
newborn children's stem

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.126 align:middle line:90%
cells taken and preserved.

00:43:26.126 --> 00:43:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Did they freeze them?

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:27.610 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: They freeze them.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And this is a new thing
that's coming about.

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:32.050 align:middle line:90%
And it's expanding tremendously.

00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:33.230 align:middle line:90%
And they're saved then.

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:35.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're saving
this for you baby.

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, to me
this is just incredible.

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:40.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even in some
very, very highly

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:42.790 align:middle line:84%
esoteric areas of
healing that have

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:46.170 align:middle line:84%
to do more with the
mind and time and space,

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:49.150 align:middle line:84%
the whole idea is these
instantaneous healings are

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:51.140 align:middle line:84%
happening as a
result of somehow,

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:55.710 align:middle line:84%
through processes, merging the
original template before it's

00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:59.550 align:middle line:84%
aged, corrupted, and so forth,
back with where they are now,

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:01.540 align:middle line:90%
even just working with the mind.

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes.

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.010 align:middle line:90%
It's such a difference.

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And you can start to
see it on the patients.

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:07.884 align:middle line:84%
You take a picture
of a patient now.

00:44:07.884 --> 00:44:09.050 align:middle line:90%
Take a picture a year later.

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:10.495 align:middle line:90%
You'll see less wrinkles.

00:44:10.495 --> 00:44:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Seriously?

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Seriously,
you see that.

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:15.820 align:middle line:90%
The glow on the patient changes.

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:16.820 align:middle line:90%
They are acting younger.

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:17.736 align:middle line:90%
They are doing things.

00:44:17.736 --> 00:44:21.160 align:middle line:84%
I make my stem cell people go
out there and be more active.

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:25.457 align:middle line:84%
The more active they are,
they start to become younger.

00:44:25.457 --> 00:44:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that-- yeah,
that's kind of interesting.

00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Because yesterday
when we were talking,

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:34.450 align:middle line:84%
you were telling me that
the fastest growing part

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:37.804 align:middle line:84%
of the field of medical
surgery is cosmetic surgery.

00:44:37.804 --> 00:44:38.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes.

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:40.855 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now what about
cosmetic stem cells?

00:44:40.855 --> 00:44:42.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you'd think
people would be--

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: I think it
would be much better.

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, give yourself just a
little time instead of someone

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:48.050 align:middle line:84%
cutting you with a
knife and you know--

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Americans want everything
fast though right?

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:51.740 align:middle line:90%
Give it to me right now.

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:52.365 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:52.365 --> 00:44:55.190 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's talk about say, a
spinal cord injury for example.

00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're going to use
these porcine stem cells

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.030 align:middle line:90%
on a spinal cord injury.

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:02.150 align:middle line:84%
What are you looking
at in terms of time?

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:03.660 align:middle line:84%
What is the cost
doing it the way

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:06.550 align:middle line:84%
you would do it, say,
an oral stem cell?

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:09.120 align:middle line:84%
How long does it take to
repair something that severe?

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN:
Everyone's different.

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's different
is the first thing.

00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:13.325 align:middle line:84%
So the first couple
times, you're

00:45:13.325 --> 00:45:16.080 align:middle line:84%
almost testing
them on the stuff.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.560 align:middle line:84%
But they should react
pretty darn quickly.

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:19.970 align:middle line:90%
My son was calling me up.

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:22.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he was seeing
someone just recently.

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And the kid had what's
called a dropped foot, OK?

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:27.890 align:middle line:84%
An as soon as we gave
him stem cells-- and this

00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:30.410 align:middle line:84%
came from surgery that
he had when he was young.

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:32.080 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we gave
him stem cells,

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:34.242 align:middle line:90%
he started to walk differently.

00:45:34.242 --> 00:45:37.170 align:middle line:84%
He used to almost trip
sometimes by hitting his foot.

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:38.150 align:middle line:90%
Now it's different.

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:41.039 align:middle line:84%
Now he can walk and hold
his foot the right way.

00:45:41.039 --> 00:45:43.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's look
at the other side of it.

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.240 align:middle line:90%
Is their flip side?

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Can stem cells actually
cause damage to the person?

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just that they
take or don't take?

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:50.886 align:middle line:90%
Can they cause damage?

00:45:50.886 --> 00:45:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: I haven't
seen any damage.

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:54.170 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen any
negative things.

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:56.114 align:middle line:84%
The biggest negative
is it's not getting

00:45:56.114 --> 00:45:57.280 align:middle line:90%
to the area for some reason.

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.571 align:middle line:90%
It's costing the patient money.

00:45:58.571 --> 00:46:00.410 align:middle line:90%
That's the biggest negative.

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And if that happens, that
means I've missed something.

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:05.024 align:middle line:90%
What have I missed?

00:46:05.024 --> 00:46:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to
get it to right.

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:08.064 align:middle line:84%
You know, like I said
before, the US is

00:46:08.064 --> 00:46:10.870 align:middle line:84%
going to drill stem into your
brain, while the French--

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do you mean
drill into your brain?

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:13.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Oh, if you've got
some problem with your brain--

00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:15.696 align:middle line:84%
let's assume there's
Alzheimer's-- the US will drill

00:46:15.696 --> 00:46:18.667 align:middle line:84%
a hole in a skull and put
themselves in there to try

00:46:18.667 --> 00:46:19.250 align:middle line:90%
to regenerate.

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they inject
them into the brain.

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Right
into the brain.

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:22.779 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's what
you're talking about in terms

00:46:22.779 --> 00:46:24.790 align:middle line:84%
of it being $10,000
or $15,000 or $20,000

00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:25.985 align:middle line:90%
is that kind of treatment.

00:46:25.985 --> 00:46:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: That's right.

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're
saying that taking it

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.262 align:middle line:90%
orally is equally effective?

00:46:30.262 --> 00:46:32.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: I'm stunned
at how effective it is.

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.724 align:middle line:84%
And again, the
French are doing it.

00:46:33.724 --> 00:46:34.640 align:middle line:90%
They're at number one.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Look them up on the World
Health Organization, OK?

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And they've been doing
it for a number of years.

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:43.076 align:middle line:84%
It's mind boggling
that it's that simple.

00:46:43.076 --> 00:46:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
it's very hopeful.

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I love
hearing about this.

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:48.530 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's go back to the French.

00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, is there
anything else on stem

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.300 align:middle line:84%
cells we can get
out on the table

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:55.210 align:middle line:84%
now for people that have
been curious about it

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:58.230 align:middle line:84%
but also intimidated
by it or afraid of it?

00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:01.330 align:middle line:10%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, really, if you
want to learn about stem cells,

00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:04.500 align:middle line:10%
you can check on my website
and actually try to contact us.

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:07.287 align:middle line:10%
We will-- if you're
interested stem cells,

00:47:07.287 --> 00:47:09.120 align:middle line:10%
there's ways that we
can do histories on you

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.740 align:middle line:10%
and tell you how we
can help you with that.

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:15.060 align:middle line:10%
I can direct you to the
people that help prep you.

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.510 align:middle line:10%
I can prep you for that.

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:19.200 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to
be set up for it.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.020 align:middle line:90%
That's a real key.

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:21.310 align:middle line:90%
People don't understand that.

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Otherwise, you're
wasting your time and money.

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: You're wasting
your time and money.

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:25.956 align:middle line:84%
Because the reason you've
got a problem in the organ

00:47:25.956 --> 00:47:29.620 align:middle line:84%
is because the circulation's
not getting there, OK?

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:31.410 align:middle line:90%
You got to open it up first.

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And now you can
regenerate that organ.

00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now-- because we
only have about 8 or 10 minutes

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:37.894 align:middle line:84%
left, I want to
get on to Obamacare

00:47:37.894 --> 00:47:39.060 align:middle line:90%
toward the end a little bit.

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:41.820 align:middle line:84%
But you mentioned
the French earlier.

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And it is that enigma,
that French enigma

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:47.940 align:middle line:84%
to be able to have some
wine and some French bread

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:51.140 align:middle line:84%
and a five course
meal and still not

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.080 align:middle line:84%
have the kind of obesity
problems we have.

00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:56.630 align:middle line:84%
What is your thought on the
French way of living and diet

00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:59.222 align:middle line:84%
that works for them in
contrast to what we're

00:47:59.222 --> 00:48:00.680 align:middle line:84%
doing to ourselves
in this country?

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: I look at them.

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people, they eat
like crazy, drink like crazy,

00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:04.620 align:middle line:90%
smoke like crazy.

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:05.953 align:middle line:90%
And they're still thin as rails.

00:48:05.953 --> 00:48:08.417 align:middle line:84%
But what goes on with them
is their day is a busy day.

00:48:08.417 --> 00:48:10.750 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the day,
when they sit down for dinner

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:13.170 align:middle line:84%
8 or 9 o'clock, they have
a two or three hour dinner.

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:14.650 align:middle line:90%
They have their bottle of wine.

00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:15.500 align:middle line:90%
They kick back.

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
thinking about the day.

00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:19.160 align:middle line:90%
The day is over.

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:20.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When I was spending
time there in France, now 20

00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:27.021 align:middle line:84%
years ago, they were still
having the two hour lunch

00:48:27.021 --> 00:48:27.520 align:middle line:90%
break.

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.805 align:middle line:84%
Now I think a lot of the
American culture has seeped in

00:48:30.805 --> 00:48:32.180 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
closing up shop--

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:32.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: American
culture is seeping in,

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:32.840 align:middle line:84%
and they're starting
to get a little bigger.

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.239 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --so much any more.

00:48:34.239 --> 00:48:35.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, a little bit.

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I wondered
if those stats might

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:37.620 align:middle line:90%
be changing with them.

00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:41.350 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing I noticed
is in conversation even,

00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:43.050 align:middle line:84%
you weren't talking
about your job.

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:44.480 align:middle line:90%
You weren't talking about money.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.855 align:middle line:84%
Those just weren't things that
people were talking about.

00:48:46.855 --> 00:48:51.260 align:middle line:84%
They were talking about food
and art and their kids and films

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and things like that,
or philosophy or books.

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.770 align:middle line:84%
We weren't talking
about these kind

00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:59.127 align:middle line:84%
of mundane goals,
these competitive goals

00:48:59.127 --> 00:49:01.460 align:middle line:84%
that we do in America over
dinner, which should give you

00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:03.340 align:middle line:84%
an upset stomach
and stop digestion

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:05.500 align:middle line:90%
all together these days.

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:08.625 align:middle line:84%
So is it something just to do
with a more natural mindset?

00:49:08.625 --> 00:49:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: It's a mindset.

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:11.083 align:middle line:90%
Their mindsets are so different.

00:49:11.083 --> 00:49:14.030 align:middle line:84%
The United States mindset is,
he who has the most toys wins.

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:17.732 align:middle line:84%
Everything was rushing around,
rushing around here and there.

00:49:17.732 --> 00:49:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, I remember a few
years ago and going back

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:20.398 align:middle line:90%
to New York City.

00:49:20.398 --> 00:49:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't been
there in a long time.

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And walking down the street,
you had to walk so fast.

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:25.850 align:middle line:84%
I had to pull over to
the side because people

00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:26.933 align:middle line:90%
would have walked over me.

00:49:26.933 --> 00:49:28.410 align:middle line:90%
I had a pain in my side.

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:30.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, good lord.

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I still
do that in New York.

00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:33.300 align:middle line:90%
Please go by.

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I just find the French
enigma fascinating myself.

00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to
know your opinion on it.

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:39.050 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: The day is over.

00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And they're just enjoying
the heck out of that day.

00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just
completely decompress,

00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:44.870 align:middle line:90%
talking with each other.

00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:47.620 align:middle line:84%
One friend I know, her
parents are in their 80s.

00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:50.120 align:middle line:84%
They still have a bottle
of wine every night

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.980 align:middle line:84%
and sit and talk with
each other over dinner

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.005 align:middle line:90%
for a couple of hours.

00:49:53.005 --> 00:49:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Yes.

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:54.253 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful.

00:49:54.253 --> 00:49:57.740 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's get on to Obamacare--
we only have about five minutes

00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:00.640 align:middle line:84%
left-- and what you see coming
down the pike as someone who

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:02.080 align:middle line:90%
is doing alternative therapies.

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Because I know there's
a lot of concern.

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: I'm very
frightened about Obamacare.

00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:09.077 align:middle line:84%
Obamacare gives them all the
goals that they've wanted.

00:50:09.077 --> 00:50:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which are?

00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Health
care, for number one,

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:12.350 align:middle line:90%
is state's rights, OK?

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:15.100 align:middle line:84%
The state of California has
MDs, osteopaths, chiropractors,

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:17.280 align:middle line:90%
naturopaths, and acupuncturists.

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Obama will pay for
only one of them.

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.672 align:middle line:90%
That's totally anti-competitive.

00:50:21.672 --> 00:50:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it
overrides states' rights.

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:25.046 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: It overrides
state's rights.

00:50:25.046 --> 00:50:26.520 align:middle line:84%
They'll pay for
one of them only.

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And now that gives
that one a monopoly.

00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:30.203 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's that do to
naturopaths in the 17 states

00:50:30.203 --> 00:50:31.469 align:middle line:90%
you said are licensing them?

00:50:31.469 --> 00:50:32.510 align:middle line:90%
What will happen to them?

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:34.270 align:middle line:90%
Will they be part of the system?

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: No.

00:50:35.010 --> 00:50:37.930 align:middle line:84%
They still get certain--
not in Medicare system.

00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:41.640 align:middle line:84%
But they'll still get maybe
your local insurance company.

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:43.180 align:middle line:84%
You're still licensed
in the state.

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:46.010 align:middle line:84%
But basically, there's going
to be a complete control taken

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:49.300 align:middle line:90%
over by the medical system.

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:51.912 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what happens
to our choices then?

00:50:51.912 --> 00:50:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Our
choices are you can

00:50:53.370 --> 00:50:55.509 align:middle line:84%
go to a naturopath
or the acupuncturist

00:50:55.509 --> 00:50:57.800 align:middle line:84%
and pay out of your own
pocket, or you can go to the MD

00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.330 align:middle line:84%
and get your surgery and
get everything for free.

00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So that's what our
choices are now.

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.590 align:middle line:90%
They're free.

00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:04.870 align:middle line:90%
You've got to pay for them.

00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people,
with our economic crisis

00:51:07.090 --> 00:51:09.202 align:middle line:84%
and all of that
going on, that's what

00:51:09.202 --> 00:51:10.410 align:middle line:90%
they're starting to look for.

00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Go to where can I get
the stuff for free?

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about HMOs
such as Kaiser Permanente

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:17.650 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:19.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for years
and years and years,

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:22.640 align:middle line:84%
they've been touting their
preventative care program.

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And under some conditions,
you can get a reimbursement

00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:28.870 align:middle line:90%
on chiropractor.

00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:31.040 align:middle line:84%
How do you see this
affecting the HMOs.

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, aren't
they going to want

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:36.780 align:middle line:84%
to have the clientele
still for people

00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:38.340 align:middle line:84%
who want to go
outside of the system

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:39.940 align:middle line:90%
for these other alternatives?

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:43.095 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Well, first of all,
with HMOs, any doctor that's

00:51:43.095 --> 00:51:46.730 align:middle line:84%
under an HMO is
working in the name HMO

00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:50.560 align:middle line:84%
because he can't make
the practice on himself.

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
of the cost of doing

00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:54.910 align:middle line:84%
business-- liability,
malpractice insurance.

00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:55.910 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: All of that.

00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's just as well
working for the system.

00:51:57.850 --> 00:52:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Any doctor that's really
intriguing won't go to an HMO.

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:03.550 align:middle line:90%
Because he's got his practice.

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:07.060 align:middle line:84%
The guys that don't
have a good practice,

00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:09.530 align:middle line:84%
the HMO will guarantee
them something like that.

00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And what goes on in
HMOs today-- they've

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.516 align:middle line:84%
broken and
compartmentalized the body.

00:52:14.516 --> 00:52:16.890 align:middle line:84%
The lung specialist doesn't
talk to the heart specialist.

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:17.806 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:52:17.806 --> 00:52:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: OK?

00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:19.670 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has broken it down.

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And I liken it to someone's
a right lung specialist

00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:25.730 align:middle line:84%
and someone's a left
lung specialist.

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:27.060 align:middle line:90%
When I was a real doctor--

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, a real doctor--

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: --I
was an eye surgeon.

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.470 align:middle line:90%
My hands were small.

00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:33.770 align:middle line:90%
My partner's hands were large.

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:34.895 align:middle line:90%
I was the left eye surgeon.

00:52:34.895 --> 00:52:36.909 align:middle line:90%
He was the right eye surgeon.

00:52:36.909 --> 00:52:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:38.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: Honest to God.

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.030 align:middle line:90%
That's how narrow my field was.

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:44.270 align:middle line:84%
I was the left eye
specialist, OK?

00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:47.104 align:middle line:84%
I was so crazy and bored
within a few years--

00:52:47.104 --> 00:52:50.182 align:middle line:90%


00:52:50.182 --> 00:52:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:56.290 align:middle line:84%
So the HMOs aren't going to--
they're not going to adapt?

00:52:56.290 --> 00:52:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Are they just going to become
more and more restricted

00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:00.477 align:middle line:90%
in terms of what they can offer?

00:53:00.477 --> 00:53:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: To me, it's
the lowest quality of care

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:03.120 align:middle line:90%
you can get.

00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:04.911 align:middle line:84%
They're breaking it
down into compartments.

00:53:04.911 --> 00:53:06.000 align:middle line:90%
You're not a compartment.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.260 align:middle line:90%
I take a drop of your blood.

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:09.747 align:middle line:84%
I know everything that's
going in your whole body.

00:53:09.747 --> 00:53:11.705 align:middle line:84%
Your blood knows everything
in your whole body.

00:53:11.705 --> 00:53:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what
about blood tests,

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:15.160 align:middle line:84%
when you go and you have
your blood panel done?

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: What they're
doing-- blood panels--

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.260 align:middle line:84%
they're looking at
all the blood panels,

00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:20.259 align:middle line:84%
and they're telling you,
well, the liver's maybe

00:53:20.259 --> 00:53:21.020 align:middle line:90%
off a little bit.

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:22.600 align:middle line:90%
This may be off a little bit.

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:24.890 align:middle line:84%
You'd better take this
pill or go surgery OK?

00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:27.814 align:middle line:84%
They're not looking at what
the heck is really going on.

00:53:27.814 --> 00:53:29.230 align:middle line:84%
They're looking
at the blood test.

00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:32.454 align:middle line:84%
Plus they've never
looked at the blood live.

00:53:32.454 --> 00:53:33.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.495 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: And
that's a big one.

00:53:34.495 --> 00:53:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're talking
about a stagnant snapshot

00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:38.820 align:middle line:90%
in a day.

00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:41.544 align:middle line:84%
What if you're under stress
that morning or something?

00:53:41.544 --> 00:53:43.210 align:middle line:84%
You're blood's going
to look differently

00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:45.280 align:middle line:84%
than it might look if you were
relaxed later in the afternoon,

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:45.490 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Well,
totally, totally, yes.

00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they're
not always reliable.

00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to throw
that in because of your work

00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:52.060 align:middle line:90%
with live blood cells.

00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Yeah,
the pHs change.

00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:55.290 align:middle line:84%
The chemistry changes
a lot depending

00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:57.427 align:middle line:84%
on your mood and
stuff like that.

00:53:57.427 --> 00:53:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we only have a
couple minutes left, Harvey.

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:02.130 align:middle line:84%
What do you see as
the greatest hope?

00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And what is your greatest
concern right now?

00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:06.905 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Well,
the greatest concern

00:54:06.905 --> 00:54:09.240 align:middle line:84%
is I've been going
against fighting

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:11.550 align:middle line:90%
the monopoly and Obamacare.

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think Obama
himself knows, really,

00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:17.210 align:middle line:84%
the reality of the
system controlling us.

00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:23.730 align:middle line:84%
We have a fascist control system
monitoring you completely.

00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:26.730 align:middle line:84%
I see it getting worse because
stem cells and a lot more

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:29.780 align:middle line:84%
people are going to do a
quote, "alternative medicine."

00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:32.300 align:middle line:84%
So I see it getting
harshness, getting worse,

00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:35.490 align:middle line:84%
because you can't
step out of the box.

00:54:35.490 --> 00:54:37.790 align:middle line:90%
That's basically what it is.

00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And the AMA is losing ground
badly because the United

00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:42.570 align:middle line:84%
States, everyone
knows, is lousy.

00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:43.406 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right

00:54:43.406 --> 00:54:44.127 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: OK?

00:54:44.127 --> 00:54:45.210 align:middle line:90%
But it's very frightening.

00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Greatest hope?

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:46.470 align:middle line:90%
Greatest hope?

00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:47.200 align:middle line:90%
Stem cells.

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: Stem
cell are the future.

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest thing
is, look, you've

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:50.820 align:middle line:84%
got to look at the
body another way.

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Instead of looking at
stopping a problem,

00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:55.964 align:middle line:84%
how can I help the body
get what it needs done?

00:54:55.964 --> 00:54:56.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BIGELSEN: That's another way.

00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:58.661 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
whole living system,

00:54:58.661 --> 00:55:00.035 align:middle line:90%
an energetic information matrix.

00:55:00.035 --> 00:55:01.535 align:middle line:84%
>>BIGELSEN: You
should come in to me

00:55:01.535 --> 00:55:04.380 align:middle line:84%
and walk out feeling better
and performing better,

00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:07.080 align:middle line:84%
not taking a pill with all
these quote, "side effects"

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:08.100 align:middle line:90%
and weaken you in there.

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:09.058 align:middle line:90%
And watch out for that.

00:55:09.058 --> 00:55:10.040 align:middle line:90%
What out for that.

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it
sounds like there's

00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:12.390 align:middle line:84%
some fabulous stuff
on the horizon.

00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And I want to
thank you for doing

00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:16.530 align:middle line:84%
your part all these to start
bringing some of this forward,

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:18.050 align:middle line:90%
including stem cells.

00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:20.390 align:middle line:84%
