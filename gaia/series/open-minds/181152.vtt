00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.100 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Dr. Donese Worden

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.560 align:middle line:10%
is an absolute
fount of information

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.390 align:middle line:10%
when it comes to a
variety of subjects

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.140 align:middle line:10%
in the world of medicine,
but particularly

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.240 align:middle line:10%
on the subject of cancer.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.600 align:middle line:84%
In short, it doesn't have to be
as scary a prospect as it once

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.600 align:middle line:84%
was, as much greater
awareness of what causes

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:90%
it comes to the forefront.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Today, Dr. Worden brings us
news of several new programs

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:84%
that help people manage
or even reverse cancer.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's a new
buzz word about it,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.870 align:middle line:84%
and it's not just a
buzzword, it's a new,

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.690 align:middle line:84%
as you said-- as we said off
camera, it's a paradigm shift,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.940 align:middle line:84%
understanding the
metabolic causes, effects,

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.627 align:middle line:90%
and cures for cancer.

00:00:57.627 --> 00:00:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DONESE WORDEN:
That's right, Regina.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.010 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.970 align:middle line:10%
You know, we're still
stuck in the dogma

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.940 align:middle line:10%
that cancer is a somatic,
genetic mutation disease.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.130 align:middle line:10%
>>WORDEN: That has never
been proven allopathically--

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.880 align:middle line:10%
It's not even proven,
it's still a theory,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.670 align:middle line:10%
but all of our research,
our monies, our forefront,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.820 align:middle line:10%
everything is going
toward that 5% to 10%

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.790 align:middle line:10%
of cancers that are
actually genetic.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:19.590 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So we need
to start looking,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.020 align:middle line:84%
and the science is clear enough
now, by some of the researchers

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.440 align:middle line:84%
that we'll talk about today,
that we need to start looking

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.820 align:middle line:90%
at this metabolic theory.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And what it is is
looking upstream,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.520 align:middle line:84%
what happens before those
genetic problems happen,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.440 align:middle line:90%
before the DNA is damaged.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.200 align:middle line:10%
And the metabolism
upstream has to do

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.480 align:middle line:10%
with the mitochondria,
those little powerhouses

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.600 align:middle line:10%
inside the cells.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.030 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So let's get
into the-- first of all,

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.380 align:middle line:10%
we need to say that, as this
information is coming together

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:10%
so fast, in your
own words, there

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.500 align:middle line:10%
are heroes, real heroes that
are emerging in the cancer story

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.420 align:middle line:10%
now, and that's
because they dare

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.364 align:middle line:10%
go against conventional wisdom.

00:01:58.364 --> 00:01:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
their lives are not

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.700 align:middle line:90%
made easy as a result of this.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.280 align:middle line:84%
But what you're attempting
to do with others

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.700 align:middle line:84%
is put together a clinic
that takes on board all

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.300 align:middle line:84%
this research, right,
and becomes also

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.581 align:middle line:84%
a clinic for application of
the various technologies?

00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: That's true, and some
of it will be in combination

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.550 align:middle line:90%
with conventional care--

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.641 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --because
some of these therapies

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:84%
actually help
radiation work better.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.540 align:middle line:84%
We can use less and
get better effect.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.860 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with chemotherapy.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.005 align:middle line:84%
We can do the metabolic
therapies before and after

00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:31.880 align:middle line:84%
if that's what the
patient and the physicians

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.560 align:middle line:84%
are choosing for that
particular patient.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.420 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of these are
standalone therapies,

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and that's what's
exciting, to be

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.970 align:middle line:84%
able to get into the research,
support the research,

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.200 align:middle line:90%
have the funding.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.850 align:middle line:84%
The grant monies,
the idea that we'd

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.700 align:middle line:84%
have to look here, and start
researching it and proving it--

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --beyond
animal models.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of really
good work seems

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.100 align:middle line:84%
to get hung up in, well, in the
animal experimentation phase.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.119 align:middle line:84%
Why does it not make
the leap over to humans?

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Well, it
will if the animal

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.220 align:middle line:90%
studies start looking positive.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.025 align:middle line:84%
Then the researchers have to
start looking for grant monies.

00:03:07.025 --> 00:03:09.150 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole other process
They can spend years--

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that can
hang it up 10 years.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --and years, and
years, and years, and years.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.370 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.320 align:middle line:90%
And they're exhausted.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, they start sometimes
in a dish, in vivo, in vitro,

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: They look
in a dish and say,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.573 align:middle line:90%
does it make a difference there?

00:03:19.573 --> 00:03:21.170 align:middle line:84%
If it does, then it
gets funded to be

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.850 align:middle line:90%
able to go to an animal study.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.574 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
well, let's see

00:03:24.574 --> 00:03:26.240 align:middle line:84%
if we can get the
grants and the funding

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.790 align:middle line:84%
to be able to look at
humans in a small trial.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.880 align:middle line:84%
But this is delaying
good medicine.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.930 align:middle line:84%
We need to look at proven
therapies and do it right.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.330 align:middle line:84%
Not going against
the conventional way

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.060 align:middle line:84%
of looking at research,
but utilizing it

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.830 align:middle line:90%
in a different light.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.460 align:middle line:84%
The metabolic theory of
cancer and the studies

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.320 align:middle line:84%
that are going on there
are extremely exciting.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Take some
time and explain to us

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.530 align:middle line:84%
about the metabolic theory
of cancer so people know,

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:84%
especially people who did not
watch my little three part

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.092 align:middle line:84%
series on this that we did
that included you, right?

00:03:59.092 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: That's what
I was going to say.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Travis and Dominic
D'Agostino were on there,

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.219 align:middle line:84%
and some of-- those
are two of those heroes

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:06.260 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And the research
that they're continuing to do

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.560 align:middle line:90%
is going farther.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.740 align:middle line:84%
So the metabolic
disease theory of cancer

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.600 align:middle line:84%
is that, what do all cancer
cells have in common?

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.399 align:middle line:84%
They eat glucose, the
voracious appetite for sugar.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Normal cells, healthy
cells, don't act like that.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So Otto Warburg, 100 years
ago, discovered this and said,

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.170 align:middle line:84%
we need to look at the
metabolism inside these cells

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.790 align:middle line:90%
to figure out what's going on.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.390 align:middle line:84%
The same time, the DNA
theory was coming around.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Guess who won?

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.900 align:middle line:10%
DNA theory, but I will tell
you that one of the tri Nobel

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.340 align:middle line:10%
laureates that won the
prize for discovering DNA,

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.400 align:middle line:10%
he said that if he was
studying cancer today,

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.640 align:middle line:10%
he would definitely be studying
the metabolism like what we're

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.120 align:middle line:10%
talking about and not the DNA,
because he said, we studied it,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.950 align:middle line:10%
we mapped it, and
it was a miserable--

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.270 align:middle line:10%
we didn't get much out of it.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why did
the DNA theory win?

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Was it politics of
the day or what?

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: My take is that
you can patent medicines,

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:84%
you can do a lot of things
when we're looking at DNA.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.700 align:middle line:84%
If we could change the
metabolism of our own bodies

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.040 align:middle line:90%
with diet, with lifestyle--

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.266 align:middle line:84%
and that may be wrong,
but that is my theory.

00:05:19.266 --> 00:05:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Follow the money.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Maybe.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.588 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
oftentimes all you

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:24.220 align:middle line:84%
have to do when
you start looking

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.520 align:middle line:84%
at why really good affordable
things don't make it

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.320 align:middle line:90%
to the forefront.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.310 align:middle line:90%
It's really simple.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:84%
There's no one that can really
gain in a huge way from it.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: You know, and we
did the Cancer Genome Atlas

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:84%
project, and that was looking
at every cancer that cells

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.230 align:middle line:84%
that we could look
at that genome.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.380 align:middle line:84%
What they found, there
were so many variations, so

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.542 align:middle line:90%
many different things.

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:44.750 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't predictable what
it was going to look like.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, how are you
going to develop anything off

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.930 align:middle line:90%
of that?

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So we, in
the metabolic world,

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.070 align:middle line:84%
keep saying, OK,
look upstream, look

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.720 align:middle line:90%
before that DNA damage happens.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So it goes back
to glucose, right?

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And cancer cells--
explain to us how

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.300 align:middle line:90%
this works on a cellular level.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And then let's get into
the subject of lactic acid

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.260 align:middle line:84%
a little bit,
because as I recall,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.170 align:middle line:84%
that was a big part
of that story too.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.128 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:06:12.128 --> 00:06:15.290 align:middle line:84%
So there's actually two
pathways that feed cancer cells.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.100 align:middle line:90%
One is a glucose type of--

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.330 align:middle line:84%
they're all about glucose
feeding the cancer,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.300 align:middle line:84%
but there's a glutamate
pathway, and then

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.060 align:middle line:84%
there's another pathway,
the glucose pathway.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.640 align:middle line:84%
So the metabolic theory is let's
block both of those pathways.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.800 align:middle line:10%
Ketogenic diet plus
hyperbaric oxygen

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.860 align:middle line:10%
together, those blocks both of
those feeders for cancer cells.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.250 align:middle line:10%
A good example,
Regina, is a PET scan.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.260 align:middle line:10%
When you get a PET
scan and it lights up

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.950 align:middle line:10%
and we've got different
places looking for metastasis,

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.030 align:middle line:10%
why is it lighting up?

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Because we put a
glucose molecule

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.060 align:middle line:84%
inside the body and those
cancer cells' voracious appetite

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.790 align:middle line:84%
light up metabolically, because
they're eating that sugar.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.710 align:middle line:90%
That's where we see.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And the more light
up we see is usually

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.730 align:middle line:84%
correlates with the
aggression or how bad

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.870 align:middle line:84%
that cancer is, because the
more it likes to eat sugar.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't really feed
off of other things, fats

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.700 align:middle line:84%
and proteins little bits,
but its main fuel is sugar.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.770 align:middle line:84%
So if we can block that
piece, those two pathways,

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.260 align:middle line:84%
then we've blocked the
ability for that cancer cell

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.780 align:middle line:84%
to replicate, to metastasize,
and to grow tumors.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.040 align:middle line:84%
So this begs the question,
to back up even further.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.700 align:middle line:84%
So as people, we
find we get-- we

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.830 align:middle line:84%
say we're under
stress, for example,

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.750 align:middle line:84%
or we've just kind
of lost the thread

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.750 align:middle line:84%
we kind of let the nice
healthy eating program go

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.630 align:middle line:84%
and we find that we're
increasingly attracted

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:41.712 align:middle line:90%
to simple carbohydrates.

00:07:41.712 --> 00:07:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:43.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sugar.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.680 align:middle line:90%
Sugar, sugar, sugar.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.190 align:middle line:90%
Everything we do--

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Emotionally.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:46.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --leads
us back to sugar.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:47.790 align:middle line:90%
Emotion leading back to sugar.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:48.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yeah.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:49.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A lot of times--

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, let's talk about
it from that point of view.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.480 align:middle line:84%
In the consumption
of the sugar, how

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.929 align:middle line:84%
do we set ourselves up,
or do we, for cancer?

00:07:59.929 --> 00:08:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Well, we're not only
feeding those potential cancer

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.670 align:middle line:84%
cells, which we all have
cancer cells all the time,

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.700 align:middle line:84%
so you're feeding them
with that glucose.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.850 align:middle line:84%
But if you're also stressing
and you picked up on that side,

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:13.720 align:middle line:84%
you can eat a ketogenic, no
carb, no sugar diet, and still

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.510 align:middle line:84%
have stress and still be
feeding those cancer cells.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.430 align:middle line:90%
So you must address it all.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.970 align:middle line:84%
So the metabolic way is, how
do we address both pathways?

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.950 align:middle line:84%
There are therapies
that we're talking

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.260 align:middle line:84%
about that will
block both pathways,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.180 align:middle line:90%
but that stress piece is big.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.020 align:middle line:84%
So when you're stressing and
you're doing emotional eating,

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.450 align:middle line:90%
you're activating both pathways.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.429 align:middle line:84%
You're giving those cancer
cells lots of fun food.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:38.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, another thing, as I
recall, is the more we stress,

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.294 align:middle line:84%
we create an acidification
of the blood itself.

00:08:45.294 --> 00:08:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's true.

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, let's talk about
that, because a lot of people

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.110 align:middle line:84%
think the holy grail
is get a Kangen machine

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.000 align:middle line:84%
and you won't get cancer,
because you stay alkalinized.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.570 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:53.130 align:middle line:90%
That--

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Alkalized.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.270 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that whole thing.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Cancer cells struggle
in an alkaline environment.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.950 align:middle line:84%
They do, but they
can still survive.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Cancer cells can
also still survive

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.230 align:middle line:84%
against chemo and radiation,
and here's the issue.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Those cells that go dormant
after those therapies and we

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:11.830 align:middle line:84%
say, oh, we got to it, you
know, five year mark you're out,

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.400 align:middle line:90%
but it comes back.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.470 align:middle line:90%
Guess what comes back?

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Those dormant cells, those
ones that were strong enough

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.350 align:middle line:84%
to fight off and
not pay attention

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.850 align:middle line:84%
to the chemo and
the radiation, they

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.820 align:middle line:84%
come back with a vengeance,
far more aggressive

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.330 align:middle line:90%
than they were to start with.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.490 align:middle line:84%
So the whole alkaline acid story
is along that line as well.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:31.880 align:middle line:90%
We have to do better.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.720 align:middle line:84%
We've got to block the pathways
we have-- that have been

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.910 align:middle line:84%
identified, and we
know how to do that

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.260 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of these therapies.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:38.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:39.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.150 align:middle line:84%
So now let's look at the
notion of cancer, of fungus,

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.010 align:middle line:90%
yeast, carbohydrates.

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.140 align:middle line:84%
You consume a lot
of carbohydrates,

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.950 align:middle line:90%
acidification of the blood.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.590 align:middle line:84%
You start bringing
in a condition that

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:54.170 align:middle line:84%
allows fungus, yeast, and
all this to grow in the body,

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:54.970 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.886 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: That's true,
but all of those things

00:09:56.886 --> 00:10:00.310 align:middle line:84%
also damage the mitochondria,
so we're back to the up stream

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:01.420 align:middle line:90%
process, right?

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.220 align:middle line:90%
We're back to--

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.344 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
the role of mitochondria

00:10:04.344 --> 00:10:06.310 align:middle line:84%
and how and why they
damage it, and what

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.610 align:middle line:84%
is the implication of
having damaged mitochondria?

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about this story,
and can that be recovered?

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Because some say, well, once
your mitochondria is damaged,

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:16.880 align:middle line:90%
that's it, it's over.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.192 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's incorrect.

00:10:18.192 --> 00:10:19.900 align:middle line:84%
We have new science
showing that we can--

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us
that whole thing.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:21.330 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: --that we can.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.930 align:middle line:84%
So the mitochondria are
those little powerhouses.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.480 align:middle line:10%
They are actually
evolutionary bacteria,

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.330 align:middle line:10%
which means they look
just like bacteria,

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.945 align:middle line:10%
they function like bacteria.

00:10:30.945 --> 00:10:32.570 align:middle line:10%
So we've got to
protect them, and we're

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.880 align:middle line:10%
learning ways to protect
them and modulate them

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.030 align:middle line:10%
so that they can help the
healthy cells be healthy.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And the mitochondria
inside the DNA, how do we

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.680 align:middle line:84%
damage that so it's not
protecting the cancer cells.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How?

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.313 align:middle line:90%
That's the question.

00:10:45.313 --> 00:10:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So these
therapies that

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.930 align:middle line:84%
are in research that have
been used on live patients

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.750 align:middle line:84%
with good effect, and
that's the exciting part is

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.260 align:middle line:84%
that we have things
right now that we know,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.490 align:middle line:90%
not just animal studies.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are in phase one
clinical trials with humans,

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.370 align:middle line:84%
but others have been
used by patients

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.060 align:middle line:84%
that decided to do
things on their own,

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.780 align:middle line:84%
which I would not
advise, because there are

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:10.130 align:middle line:90%
side effects with these things.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Because if it's going to kill
off a tumor very quickly,

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.850 align:middle line:90%
that could be dangerous.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.920 align:middle line:84%
So you always have
to have supervision.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.640 align:middle line:84%
But the exciting research
that's going on along this,

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.720 align:middle line:84%
it's all about that
mitochondrial process

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.860 align:middle line:90%
inside the cell.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.500 align:middle line:84%
What I want patients to
know is, those cancer

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.560 align:middle line:84%
cells and your cells,
they work differently

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.420 align:middle line:84%
in the way they process
energy differently.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:37.200 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes one turn into
a cancer and the other one not.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.260 align:middle line:84%
It's the way they
process that energy,

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and that has to do with
that whole cytoplasm,

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.660 align:middle line:90%
that around the nucleus part.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Interesting, transplants,
thought it couldn't be done.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:51.170 align:middle line:10%
You take a mitochondria from one
cell and put it into another.

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:52.710 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's been done.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And interesting, you take
a healthy cell mitochondria

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.260 align:middle line:84%
or that nucleus, put
it into a cancer cell,

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.720 align:middle line:84%
or if you do it vice
versa, guess what happens?

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.320 align:middle line:84%
It teaches us with
those transplant

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.520 align:middle line:84%
mitochondrial transplant
experiments is that this cancer

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:84%
mutation is-- this
cancer process has

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.190 align:middle line:84%
to do with the
metabolism of the cell,

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.590 align:middle line:84%
not just the DNA
in that nucleus.

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, how do we keep
the mitochondria intact

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:22.500 align:middle line:84%
so it doesn't even end up
in this ravaged condition

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.500 align:middle line:90%
to begin with?

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Well,
there's a lot of things

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:25.120 align:middle line:90%
that attack our mitochondria.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just have to
live a super healthy life.

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: It's all the--

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.680 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's all the
things that we already know.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.990 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting fact too is
that everybody says, well, you

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.100 align:middle line:90%
need a lot of antioxidants.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes and no.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.620 align:middle line:90%
It's all about timing.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.200 align:middle line:84%
So the new processes
that are coming

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.900 align:middle line:84%
through with all the research
it's called a press pulse

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.520 align:middle line:90%
way of doing these therapies.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.645 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's that mean?

00:12:45.645 --> 00:12:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: We want to-- that
means that we take those cancer

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.540 align:middle line:84%
cells and we do something
that's going to really aggravate

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.010 align:middle line:84%
them and make them
start dying off,

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.385 align:middle line:90%
and then we've got to back off.

00:12:55.385 --> 00:12:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And then we've
got to do it again

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.440 align:middle line:84%
and we have to
change the dosage,

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.720 align:middle line:90%
we have to change the timing.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Those antioxidants,
the same way.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:06.840 align:middle line:84%
You don't do an antioxidant
during certain therapies.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.660 align:middle line:84%
It will work against it, and
actually, the antioxidants

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:14.130 align:middle line:84%
can protect the cancer cells
from the treatments just

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.750 align:middle line:90%
like the normal cells.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.257 align:middle line:84%
So it's all about timing and
we're learning more and more

00:13:19.257 --> 00:13:21.090 align:middle line:84%
about that, and that's
why these researchers

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.160 align:middle line:90%
are about timing and dosage.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's in combination with
either natural or complementary

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:29.160 align:middle line:84%
alternative medicine
treatments on their own

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.180 align:middle line:84%
or in conjunction with
surgery, chemo, and radiation.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And we know that these patients
that are doing this before

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.950 align:middle line:84%
and after-- my patients
have done it too--

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:38.970 align:middle line:90%
we have better effect.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:40.560 align:middle line:84%
We're not getting
the side effects.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.450 align:middle line:84%
We can use less of
the toxic agents

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.700 align:middle line:90%
and have a better outcome.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are some of
the myths that we also--

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.234 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we just
talked about some

00:13:48.234 --> 00:13:50.670 align:middle line:84%
of the things that can
damage mitochondria

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and can lead to the
development of cancer,

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.910 align:middle line:84%
or the expression of
cancer, however you say it.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Are there any myths in that
mix where we say, oh, you

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.080 align:middle line:90%
absolutely can't do this?

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.830 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's kind of
become kind of almost

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:09.489 align:middle line:84%
to the extent of urban myth or
so that if you don't do this,

00:14:09.489 --> 00:14:10.780 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to get cancer.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.800 align:middle line:84%
If you do do this, you
are going to get cancer.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Are there any hard
line anythings,

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.650 align:middle line:90%
as unique as we each are?

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: It is so multifaceted.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:22.026 align:middle line:84%
Every cancer cell
expresses differently even

00:14:22.026 --> 00:14:23.400 align:middle line:84%
to the same type
of cancer cells.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Say they're all
breast cancer cells,

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and we know the
genetics of that one.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:90%
They all express differently.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And they change epigenetically
by what we eat, how we feel,

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.130 align:middle line:90%
if we exercised or not.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.330 align:middle line:90%
It's so variable.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:40.650 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the way
we started working on HIV

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:43.714 align:middle line:84%
and got that under control
was a multimodal approach.

00:14:43.714 --> 00:14:45.630 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
do cancer the same way.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:46.960 align:middle line:90%
It will not be one cure.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: It will be, what
does that individual patient

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.020 align:middle line:90%
need in this moment?

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.460 align:middle line:90%
We do leading edge testing.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.074 align:middle line:84%
We see what's not
right in this patient.

00:14:56.074 --> 00:14:58.240 align:middle line:84%
You're working on the
emotional, spiritual side too,

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.200 align:middle line:84%
but mechanically, what's
not working right?

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Do those tests, get this
patient's body ready,

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and then choose the
appropriate types

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:12.240 align:middle line:84%
of treatments and the timing and
the dosage of those treatments.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.040 align:middle line:90%
that's critical.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I do-- I
mean, I picked up

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.270 align:middle line:90%
on what you just said.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Get the body ready
for this fight.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Well, and I'm
going to go beyond that.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we all
have cancer cells.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't like saying
the word fight.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.162 align:middle line:84%
I like saying let's
live in unity.

00:15:26.162 --> 00:15:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So we can
live with cancer.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.270 align:middle line:84%
It's the tumor gets
so large that--

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Prepping the body
so that you're-- you can live

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:35.462 align:middle line:84%
in unity as you start
dealing with this.

00:15:35.462 --> 00:15:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:36.870 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And getting
it to back off.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.140 align:middle line:90%
To be quiet.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To be quiet.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.218 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: To lay
there, don't grow.

00:15:42.218 --> 00:15:43.440 align:middle line:90%
Don't grow and metastasize.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.770 align:middle line:90%
That's the big piece.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:47.930 align:middle line:84%
What we don't want is
those cells to out--

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.000 align:middle line:84%
you know, to move
out of the tumor,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.960 align:middle line:84%
and then they start
moving around the body.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.160 align:middle line:84%
That's what is
detrimental to us.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What you're trying
to do is isolate them.

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:55.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:59.490 align:middle line:84%
So essentially,
before we even begin

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:03.360 align:middle line:84%
getting into all these
wonderful new potentials,

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.180 align:middle line:84%
the fact is cancer does not
have to be-- once all of this

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.400 align:middle line:84%
comes to the forefront, once
these therapies are made

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.270 align:middle line:84%
available, once people can be
looked at as an individual,

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:15.330 align:middle line:84%
cancer does not have to be a
scary diagnosis in the same way

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:16.440 align:middle line:90%
anymore, does it?

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.481 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's correct.

00:16:17.481 --> 00:16:18.480 align:middle line:90%
We need to outsmart it.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And we're starting
to learn more about it,

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.920 align:middle line:90%
learn more about the individual.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.496 align:middle line:84%
If we're going after
that cell or that DNA

00:16:25.496 --> 00:16:27.870 align:middle line:84%
like we've been doing, we're
swimming all over the place,

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.580 align:middle line:84%
and every new therapy
that comes along

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:32.760 align:middle line:84%
is not really working very
well and we wonder why.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.010 align:middle line:84%
If we go back, what
feeds the cancer?

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Let's starve it to death.

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's starve it to
death and manipulate it

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:43.290 align:middle line:84%
with these types of therapies
that we knock it down

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.082 align:middle line:84%
and we help the healthy
cells be healthier.

00:16:45.082 --> 00:16:47.456 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's start talking
about some of the therapies

00:16:47.456 --> 00:16:48.310 align:middle line:90%
specifically.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I was very, very
fond of the story of Dr. Ko--

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --in our last
triplet of interviews together.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With Travis
and also Dominic.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.090 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And I just
talked to Dr. Ko yesterday,

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and I asked her, I said, tell me
what's on the forefront again,

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:04.599 align:middle line:84%
because there's
always something new.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We need to
explain, for people

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.089 align:middle line:84%
who do not know who
she is, who she is,

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:09.505 align:middle line:84%
what she contributed what--
how it's been taken up or not.

00:17:09.505 --> 00:17:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So the Warburg
theory, 100 years ago,

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.089 align:middle line:84%
when we noticed this
whole metabolism,

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:17.920 align:middle line:84%
right, it got brought back
to light about 60 years ago

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.950 align:middle line:84%
with Dr. Peterson at
Johns Hopkins University.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.589 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Ko studied
with Dr. Peterson.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:26.290 align:middle line:84%
While Dr. Ko was there,
she discovered a molecule

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:28.359 align:middle line:90%
called 3-bromopyruvate.

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:33.700 align:middle line:84%
That molecule, when a
cancer cell eats that sugar,

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.410 align:middle line:90%
it needs to spit out its waste.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:37.030 align:middle line:90%
That's called lactic acid.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:40.330 align:middle line:84%
When it opens up, and it doesn't
open up for anything, except

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:43.180 align:middle line:84%
to spit out the lactic
acid, 3-bromopyruvate

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.740 align:middle line:90%
looks like lactic acid.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:45.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a Trojan horse.

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Opens up and it
kills cancer cells.

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:52.400 align:middle line:84%
It's selective to cancer
cells, not normal cells.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.200 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.283 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So what happens?

00:17:54.283 --> 00:17:55.441 align:middle line:90%
When it opens up--

00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: It lets that--

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --it targets
it and lets it in.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: It lets it in and
it destroys that cancer cell.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.990 align:middle line:84%
So now she's telling me the
latest research-- in fact,

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.030 align:middle line:90%
she's writing it up right now--

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:09.160 align:middle line:84%
is that she knows that, with
chemo, radiation, and surgery,

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.470 align:middle line:84%
if we do that 3-bromo
in this timing

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:14.750 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about,
again, we can use less.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:19.660 align:middle line:84%
You can also use it as a
monotherapy, means on its own,

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and be able to use it and
have all kinds of ways

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:26.320 align:middle line:84%
that we can utilize it and
starve those cancer cells.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.840 align:middle line:84%
But beyond starving
it, if you ketogenic

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.559 align:middle line:84%
diet starve it and you put
this little bullet inside,

00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:34.600 align:middle line:84%
those cancer cells are
going to have a hard time.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.016 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It sounded so-- oh,
it sounded so hopeful to me.

00:18:37.016 --> 00:18:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is she was starved
off of all her, as I recall,

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:41.770 align:middle line:90%
funding or something.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.210 align:middle line:90%
Did the funding dry up?

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:44.880 align:middle line:90%
It was so hopeful a story.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
not dead by any means.

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: No, it is not.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about--

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.856 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And you
know what it is,

00:18:49.856 --> 00:18:52.060 align:middle line:84%
it's she's calling it
the new Ko technology,

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.044 align:middle line:90%
and she's going plowing forward.

00:18:54.044 --> 00:18:55.460 align:middle line:84%
She's funding a
lot of it herself.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.890 align:middle line:84%
She does have some
foundation support.

00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:58.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And we'll--
at the end of this,

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:01.400 align:middle line:84%
I know we're going
to put up a slide--

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'll put up a
screen so everybody can know.

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:03.201 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --or
something saying here

00:19:03.201 --> 00:19:05.076 align:middle line:84%
are the foundations
everybody should support.

00:19:05.076 --> 00:19:06.160 align:middle line:90%
Young Ko's is one of them.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.440 align:middle line:84%
But her research has
continued to go forward.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.830 align:middle line:84%
She's been in her lab pushing
it forward outside of Johns

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Hopkins, so she is not going
to let this go, nor should she.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.725 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Has she been able to
do any more human participant

00:19:17.725 --> 00:19:18.010 align:middle line:90%
studies?

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:19.255 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: No, that had to--

00:19:19.255 --> 00:19:21.310 align:middle line:84%
it happened outside
of the United States.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:23.770 align:middle line:84%
But her mouse studies
are so clear right now,

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:27.070 align:middle line:84%
it looks like she's going to
be able to get either NIH grant

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:28.000 align:middle line:90%
moneys or funding.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.560 align:middle line:90%
Or she may not want that.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.170 align:middle line:84%
She may want it
privately funded to be

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:33.950 align:middle line:90%
able to hold onto that molecule.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:37.300 align:middle line:84%
But hers is showing that they
are more effective than most

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.662 align:middle line:90%
of our anti-cancer drugs.

00:19:39.662 --> 00:19:40.495 align:middle line:90%
It's more effective.

00:19:40.495 --> 00:19:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it sounds
so simple and direct

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.320 align:middle line:90%
and to the source.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: That's
the beauty of it.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It makes
perfect sense.

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:50.200 align:middle line:84%
So that is continuing, and
it can be used stand alone.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And for anybody
who hasn't seen it,

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.760 align:middle line:84%
you need to go back and watch
my previous interviews where

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:90%
we talk about this, because--

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.220 align:middle line:84%
yeah, we go into great
detail about one young man

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.902 align:middle line:84%
in particular who
is all but gone.

00:20:01.902 --> 00:20:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.110 align:middle line:84%
There are other
patients that have

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:08.020 align:middle line:84%
experienced the 3-bromopyruvate
in the United States.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.207 align:middle line:84%
Those are called case studies,
with all those sign-offs

00:20:11.207 --> 00:20:12.790 align:middle line:84%
and this and that
that have to happen.

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And?

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So yes,
fantastic effect.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Seeing what she's seeing in
the animal studies in humans.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.820 align:middle line:84%
What I'm excited about
is to be able to have

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.470 align:middle line:90%
a center where we can do this.

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:24.650 align:middle line:90%
Pull it all in there.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's get the funding,
let's get the research,

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.660 align:middle line:84%
and let's move these
things forward and stop

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.820 align:middle line:84%
making our patients
wait for these kinds

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.080 align:middle line:90%
of wonderful therapies.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty is it's not
damaging to the normal cells.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:36.910 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.700 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, the only thing
I remember from last story

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.145 align:middle line:84%
is if you go really
aggressively it

00:20:42.145 --> 00:20:45.170 align:middle line:84%
can work really, really fast and
have some major toxic die-off.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:47.122 align:middle line:84%
So again, this has
to be done correctly.

00:20:47.122 --> 00:20:48.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, but she's adjusted the
dosage where she's not really

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.155 align:middle line:90%
seeing that, but also--

00:20:52.155 --> 00:20:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excellent.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.173 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --that I just told
her about these homeopathic

00:20:55.173 --> 00:20:57.840 align:middle line:84%
injections that are helping
the liver regenerate, which

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.311 align:middle line:84%
something that I found
that was my discovery,

00:21:00.311 --> 00:21:01.810 align:middle line:84%
and I'm teaching
doctors about that.

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:03.980 align:middle line:90%
I just told Young about it.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And she said, OK,
so we're hoping

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:09.970 align:middle line:84%
to get that injectable into
her lab into the mouse studies

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:14.740 align:middle line:84%
to see if she does larger
doses of the 3-bromopyruvate

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.960 align:middle line:84%
if this is going to help
her be able to go even more

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.400 align:middle line:84%
aggressively for those
aggressive cancers.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.550 align:middle line:84%
So we're starting
some things right now.

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:24.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So which bodies
have to approve this

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.350 align:middle line:90%
as a legal treatment in the US?

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Nothing in
her-- in animal studies.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:27.400 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, in humans.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.390 align:middle line:90%
What has to happen?

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Well, there
can go different ways.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's the
traditional process?

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: It can be
privately funded.

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:35.232 align:middle line:84%
It can be go through
an NIH grant.

00:21:35.232 --> 00:21:36.940 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
trying to get the grant

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.100 align:middle line:90%
monies to be able to do that.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.620 align:middle line:84%
So the groups that
I'm working with now

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.030 align:middle line:90%
we plan to do all of it.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:44.288 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Do all of it.

00:21:44.288 --> 00:21:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Private research
for the ones that

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.586 align:middle line:84%
need to stay in that
for profit side of it.

00:21:49.586 --> 00:21:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And then for the ones that
we can get grant monies,

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.620 align:middle line:84%
we can get NIH and it's not
going to take 100 years,

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.320 align:middle line:84%
we want to work with
conventional medicine

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.500 align:middle line:84%
in furthering these
kinds of therapies.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does it
require like FDA approval

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.630 align:middle line:84%
or what kind of approval does it
require in order to be taken up

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:06.680 align:middle line:90%
by the medical industry?

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: To be considered
standard of care for oncology,

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.670 align:middle line:90%
it needs FDA approval.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:11.720 align:middle line:84%
That means it's
got to go through

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.095 align:middle line:84%
the double blind, placebo
control side, that whole thing.

00:22:14.095 --> 00:22:15.200 align:middle line:90%
We're talking years.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.390 align:middle line:84%
But there are phase
one, two, and three.

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:19.520 align:middle line:84%
There are human studies
that patients can go to.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And when we get an IRB from our
clinic, we'll be able to do it.

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh excellent.

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:25.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:27.230 align:middle line:84%
So tell me where--
tell me the next--

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:28.915 align:middle line:84%
because since we
made this originally,

00:22:28.915 --> 00:22:30.540 align:middle line:84%
which there's a ton
of other therapies.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:32.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A whole bunch
of new data has come in.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's true.

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So where do
you want to take it next.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:36.180 align:middle line:10%
>>WORDEN: Let me start
with Dr. Robert Elliott

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:36.980 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:37.780 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.940 align:middle line:10%
>>WORDEN: He is down in
Louisiana in Baton Rouge.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.220 align:middle line:84%
He's affiliated with Tulane
and major institutes.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.840 align:middle line:90%
He has over 90 publications.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.400 align:middle line:84%
He is probably one
of the preeminent

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.620 align:middle line:84%
and probably is the
preeminent researcher

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.690 align:middle line:90%
in the mitochondria, right?

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:56.390 align:middle line:84%
He happens to be a
breast cancer surgeon,

00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:00.170 align:middle line:84%
and he has his breast cancer
surgery center there as well.

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:01.310 align:middle line:90%
He has his microscopes.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.380 align:middle line:84%
He's been studying
the mitochondria

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.530 align:middle line:84%
of those breast cancer
tissues for many, many years.

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And?

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:08.788 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And so
he was a proponent

00:23:08.788 --> 00:23:09.800 align:middle line:90%
of the metabolic theory.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.940 align:middle line:90%
He goes, of course.

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So he had his patients
on ketogenic diet

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.120 align:middle line:84%
when those studies
started coming through.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.919 align:middle line:84%
He's also found--
he's also taught

00:23:16.919 --> 00:23:17.960 align:middle line:90%
us a lot of other things.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.210 align:middle line:84%
That high iron
levels feeds cancer.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:24.530 align:middle line:84%
He's also taught us that, you
know, stress within the cells.

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:26.210 align:middle line:90%
So he's got a lot.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:30.140 align:middle line:84%
He has patents for prostate
vaccines, breast cancer

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.100 align:middle line:90%
vaccines.

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:32.720 align:middle line:84%
He's working with
the immune system.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.510 align:middle line:84%
I have cancer patients
that have tumors removed.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.970 align:middle line:84%
We send the pathological
tissue to Dr. Elliott.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:40.520 align:middle line:84%
He looks at it under the slide
and he figures out the best

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.980 align:middle line:84%
treatment for that
patient from if he's

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.590 align:middle line:84%
going to create a vaccine
that will stimulate

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.530 align:middle line:84%
their own immune system, so
he's looking at the patient's

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.870 align:middle line:84%
immune system and saying,
what do I need to do here,

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:54.090 align:middle line:84%
and what can I do to help the
patient's immune system do

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:54.890 align:middle line:90%
this?

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:56.520 align:middle line:90%
He's done so many other things.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:00.910 align:middle line:10%
But I will tell you his latest
is that, in those dishes, he--

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:04.700 align:middle line:10%
we knew that, by his
studies, that antibiotics

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.410 align:middle line:10%
destroy the mitochondria.

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.630 align:middle line:10%
If you destroy the
mitochondria inside the cell

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:10.220 align:middle line:10%
and it can't respirator,
what happens?

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.510 align:middle line:10%
What's downstream?

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:14.301 align:middle line:84%
Cancer and
neurodegenerative diseases.

00:24:14.301 --> 00:24:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Now we're talking Alzheimer's,
dementia, all the brain

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:17.450 align:middle line:90%
pathologies.

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:18.410 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:21.170 align:middle line:84%
That's not-- that
part's not debated.

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.690 align:middle line:84%
But he knew this
about antibiotics.

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Been studying it, writing
papers, presenting it

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.620 align:middle line:90%
at research institutions.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not getting into
mainstream medicine,

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.510 align:middle line:84%
because it's still considered
in the research world.

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:35.450 align:middle line:84%
But what he found is very
interesting is in the dishes.

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Remember we said
we start cell life,

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:40.220 align:middle line:84%
like breast cancer line
or prostate, in a dish.

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Guess what those
dishes medium comes in?

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.960 align:middle line:84%
An antibiotic in that medium
so it doesn't grow bacteria.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:45.950 align:middle line:90%
So guess what?

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:47.040 align:middle line:90%
That changes--

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.710 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: --all our findings.

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And that's
shaken the world of.

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And trust me, it hasn't hit
the boat yet, but when it does,

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.540 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be big.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.240 align:middle line:84%
He went back and did some
of his own experiments

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:02.450 align:middle line:84%
and it changed the results
without the antibiotics

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:03.380 align:middle line:90%
in the medium.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:06.140 align:middle line:84%
So that may be why sometimes
we see something in a dish

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.520 align:middle line:84%
and it makes all
these headlines.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.839 align:middle line:84%
They take it to animal
studies and it fails.

00:25:09.839 --> 00:25:10.880 align:middle line:90%
That's one of the pieces.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because of
the medium in the dish.

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Maybe.

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:13.160 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.620 align:middle line:84%
So now we've got to go
back and rethink all that.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.399 align:middle line:90%
So he-- he's a beautiful--

00:25:17.399 --> 00:25:18.940 align:middle line:84%
I love him, Regina,
in a lot of ways.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.273 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's his first name?

00:25:20.273 --> 00:25:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Dr. Robert
Elliott in Baton Rouge.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:23.990 align:middle line:90%
He's in his 80's.

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:27.500 align:middle line:84%
He gets up at 3:00 AM, he
is in that lab 7 days a week

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.430 align:middle line:90%
and seeing patients.

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:30.570 align:middle line:84%
He still does surgery
two days a week.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.380 align:middle line:84%
This is an incredible,
incredible human being

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:34.286 align:middle line:90%
with a heart.

00:25:34.286 --> 00:25:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And what I'll say
about every one

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.850 align:middle line:84%
of these researchers, Dr.
Ko that we talked about,

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Dominic D'Agostino, they
are passionate about what

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:45.290 align:middle line:84%
is right they have a heart and
their science is impeccable.

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:48.740 align:middle line:84%
They are research oriented
scientists, but they say,

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:50.660 align:middle line:84%
we want whatever's
best for the patient.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
gathered them and said,

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:58.554 align:middle line:84%
OK, once a month we're
getting on a call

00:25:58.554 --> 00:26:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and you're all going to
talk about your latest

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:01.970 align:middle line:84%
research together,
because it helps

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:03.590 align:middle line:90%
everything go forward faster.

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:05.720 align:middle line:84%
So we're calling it our
metabolic mastermind.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's tough to get all
of our schedules together,

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:08.980 align:middle line:84%
but we're doing it
and it's so fun.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:10.810 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, one thing that popped out
that's kind of ironic with Dr.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Elliot's findings is
that iron has always

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:19.340 align:middle line:84%
been more or less
kind of prescribed

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.610 align:middle line:84%
as a nutrient for women,
especially when they're still

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:22.410 align:middle line:90%
ovulating.

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: If you're
iron deficient,

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.580 align:middle line:84%
you need that iron to
be in a certain level,

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.120 align:middle line:84%
because that iron
carries the oxygen.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So it's about balance,
like any of these things

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:30.260 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:30.334 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:30.334 --> 00:26:32.000 align:middle line:84%
But how do you
know, as a consumer?

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: You get your iron
and your ferritin tested.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.439 align:middle line:84%
The storage iron, if that iron
is high, you should give blood.

00:26:38.439 --> 00:26:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they won't use
it, because iron is too high.

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually detrimental
for cancer growth.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.872 align:middle line:90%
It's going to help cancers grow.

00:26:47.872 --> 00:26:49.330 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is
that if you have

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:52.692 align:middle line:84%
to take an antibiotic, if you
take n-acetyl cysteine-- it's

00:26:52.692 --> 00:26:55.150 align:middle line:84%
something that could buy at
the store or at their doctors--

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:57.820 align:middle line:84%
if you take NAC,
that seems to be,

00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.890 align:middle line:84%
according to Dr.
Elliot's research,

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:02.770 align:middle line:84%
that seems to be
protecting the mitochondria

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:03.980 align:middle line:90%
from the antibiotic.

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:04.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:05.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So that's
a good point as well.

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: NAC.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:07.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:08.190 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:09.784 align:middle line:84%
People, everybody
get your pens and--

00:27:09.784 --> 00:27:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: NAC, that's right.

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --pencils
and paper and--

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Or stay healthy
and don't use the antibiotic.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Stay healthy, but
write this stuff down.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.080 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.870 align:middle line:84%
So which researcher
are we going to next?

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And also, with Dominic's work,
is anything coming out of him.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.130 align:middle line:90%
So I just talked to him.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Actually, he texted
me about an hour

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.610 align:middle line:90%
before we started doing this.

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And he is a neuroscientist,
as you're well aware.

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:32.530 align:middle line:84%
He is funded by the
Department of Defense.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:34.640 align:middle line:84%
He's at University
of Southern Florida.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.114 align:middle line:84%
He was finding the best ways
and go back to those old,

00:27:37.114 --> 00:27:38.530 align:middle line:84%
you know, the ones
that we already

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:42.070 align:middle line:84%
did that series of three, the
astronauts and war fighters,

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:middle line:84%
trying to make our
super soldiers stronger.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.150 align:middle line:84%
The same treatment for
them is the same treatment

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:48.070 align:middle line:84%
we all need, whether
we have cancer or not.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:50.440 align:middle line:84%
But what he's
finding is, you know,

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.960 align:middle line:84%
he's done a lot of studies
that are continuing forward

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.540 align:middle line:84%
on the hyperbaric oxygen
and ketogenic diet.

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:56.770 align:middle line:90%
There's so much out there.

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:58.900 align:middle line:90%
Our listeners can get that.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.900 align:middle line:84%
But you calorie restrict,
you do intermittent fasting,

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.130 align:middle line:90%
you do ketogenic diet.

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:04.180 align:middle line:90%
You do those things.

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.437 align:middle line:84%
And we've gotten very
specific, by the way, Regina.

00:28:06.437 --> 00:28:08.270 align:middle line:84%
If you have a certain
type of breast cancer,

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.353 align:middle line:84%
we know which one of those
are going to be better.

00:28:10.353 --> 00:28:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Is it intermittent fasting,
or is it calorie restriction,

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.590 align:middle line:90%
or is it ketogenic and calorie?

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:16.910 align:middle line:84%
We're getting
smarter and better.

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:18.740 align:middle line:90%
Which way do you need to do it?

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.680 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime,
Dominic told me

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:24.950 align:middle line:84%
that it's too early to tell,
but they're studying a molecule.

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:28.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a molecule that blocks
glucose and in conjunction

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:31.060 align:middle line:90%
with vitamin C IVs.

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Right now, a lot of naturopaths,
a lot of holistic practitioners

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.560 align:middle line:84%
use vitamin C IV's
for cancer treatment,

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.766 align:middle line:84%
but the FDA has
not approved that.

00:28:38.766 --> 00:28:40.390 align:middle line:84%
We don't have enough
science behind it.

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:41.800 align:middle line:90%
We've known it.

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Those of us-- you know, I
have MD Anderson integrative

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:47.710 align:middle line:84%
oncologists that'll
refer to me if they're

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:48.890 align:middle line:90%
doing a certain chemo.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:49.690 align:middle line:90%
But we don't know.

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:50.500 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know.

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.520 align:middle line:90%
We don't know how.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.430 align:middle line:84%
We don't know exactly
when the timing should be.

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Or after-- now Elliott,
Dr. Elliott and those

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.860 align:middle line:84%
are teaching us when we need
those antioxidants to be done.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:03.040 align:middle line:84%
But Dominic's
research, this molecule

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.912 align:middle line:84%
to block the glucose and vitamin
C it's too early to tell,

00:29:05.912 --> 00:29:08.120 align:middle line:84%
but there is a research
going on with that right now.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.220 align:middle line:84%
So now maybe we'll
be able to say, yeah,

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.630 align:middle line:84%
we do think that vitamin C is
going to be a good treatment.

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's promising--

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Very promising.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --but it's
not FDA approved.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's the
good news on his front.

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:18.790 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:19.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:20.470 align:middle line:90%
Continue please.

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So the
this whole press

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:27.910 align:middle line:84%
pulse metabolic therapy,
Dr. Seyfried and Dominic,

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:31.540 align:middle line:84%
so Tom and Dom came up with this
with some other researchers,

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.510 align:middle line:84%
and they are studying that
with many different molecules

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:37.840 align:middle line:84%
now, not just the ketogenic diet
and hyperbaric and all that.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.510 align:middle line:84%
They're putting a lot of things
into the mix and studying it.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:44.200 align:middle line:84%
When we do that press
pulse, when we're--

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.196 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like the body,
right, it changes all the time.

00:29:47.196 --> 00:29:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So why wouldn't we
think about changing

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.370 align:middle line:84%
those therapies, which
they do, and the effect is

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:52.480 align:middle line:90%
very exciting.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And they put out a big
paper that people can find,

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:56.590 align:middle line:90%
and they should look at that.

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:59.890 align:middle line:84%
It's nontoxic it's cost
effective strategy.

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:02.740 align:middle line:84%
For whatever we're
choosing to utilize,

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.870 align:middle line:84%
let's look at the timing and
the dosage, and alter that.

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:06.745 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:30:06.745 --> 00:30:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: It's individualized.

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, Yeah.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.240 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me bring
a concept here.

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yeah.

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Many years ago, I
interviewed a very interesting

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:15.550 align:middle line:90%
man.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:18.340 align:middle line:84%
He was a physicist,
but he was inventing

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:22.420 align:middle line:84%
some very interesting energy
based technologies in the Black

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:23.460 align:middle line:90%
Forest in Germany.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:24.260 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes.

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People in that field
know the man, Wolfgang Ludwig,

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.920 align:middle line:84%
and one of the things he
said in the end to me,

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.160 align:middle line:90%
he said, it's all in the guts.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.046 align:middle line:84%
All of your health
is in the guts.

00:30:35.046 --> 00:30:36.670 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's
where the yeast grows.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:39.410 align:middle line:84%
That's where all this stuff
grows and spreads and changes

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:40.210 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
this for a moment,

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.614 align:middle line:84%
because again, we're
talking about ketogenic.

00:30:43.614 --> 00:30:46.090 align:middle line:84%
Some people say, OK
ketogenic leads us

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:47.560 align:middle line:90%
to the subject of paleo.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Paleo leads you to
the subject of vegan.

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Everything-- everyone has a
different need, of course,

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.790 align:middle line:90%
but let's talk about the guts.

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:57.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So the microbiome
is your immune system.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:00.140 align:middle line:84%
That's it, and that does
affect the mitochondria.

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So I'm back to, yes, the
gut health is imperative,

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.170 align:middle line:84%
and we know that's
why antibiotics

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:08.510 align:middle line:84%
is destroying that mitochondria
and leading to cancer, right?

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:09.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:10.726 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So that
whole microbiome

00:31:10.726 --> 00:31:13.420 align:middle line:84%
is a very big piece
of this, and that's

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.370 align:middle line:84%
why Dr. Elliot is
continuing to study

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:18.370 align:middle line:84%
these effects of these
antibiotics on the microbiome,

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:20.170 align:middle line:90%
because that's what it does.

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:22.480 align:middle line:90%
It alters the microbiome.

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.090 align:middle line:90%
That DNA, it alters that.

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Now our gut can't produce
the immune system in the way

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:32.920 align:middle line:84%
that it needs to be able to
keep these cancer cells at bay.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.240 align:middle line:90%
So it's a big piece.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.434 align:middle line:84%
So you know-- and back to
though the energy piece

00:31:37.434 --> 00:31:39.100 align:middle line:84%
that you were talking
about, the German.

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:41.380 align:middle line:10%
There is actually, for some
of the brain tumors now,

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.480 align:middle line:10%
they actually have--

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.240 align:middle line:10%
one of the therapies that's
FDA approved right now

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.700 align:middle line:10%
is a device that they
wear that's putting

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.040 align:middle line:10%
electromagnetic
frequencies in the body

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.590 align:middle line:10%
differently through that brain.

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:55.740 align:middle line:84%
They only use it, for the most
part, if they're inoperable,

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.090 align:middle line:84%
they can't do the surgery,
the chemo, the radiation.

00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:01.900 align:middle line:84%
They're using these devices
and that's interesting as well.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Popp, another
German researcher scientist,

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:09.790 align:middle line:84%
what he found was that
all chemical carcinogens,

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:11.910 align:middle line:84%
the ones that we know
that cause cancer,

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:13.900 align:middle line:84%
that they all have
something in common.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.612 align:middle line:84%
They block it's the
light of 380 nanometers.

00:32:17.612 --> 00:32:18.570 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:21.090 align:middle line:84%
So now we know
certain frequencies

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:25.050 align:middle line:84%
that these chemical
carcinogens block

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:27.240 align:middle line:84%
that that may be
the piece allowing

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:31.470 align:middle line:84%
that DNA and the
mitochondria to be damaged.

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:33.750 align:middle line:84%
So I think frequency medicine
is a big piece here--

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, huge.

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: --and I love that.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.956 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted-- that will
be part of the things

00:32:36.956 --> 00:32:39.624 align:middle line:84%
that we want to study in
this center not just diet

00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:40.424 align:middle line:90%
and pharmacology.

00:32:40.424 --> 00:32:42.780 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, they
were using light therapy,

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.510 align:middle line:10%
and color and light
therapy for cancer

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:47.304 align:middle line:10%
back in the '20s,
and '30s, and '40s.

00:32:47.304 --> 00:32:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that
was all shut down.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.163 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have any
studies behind it right now,

00:32:51.163 --> 00:32:53.730 align:middle line:84%
but we want to do it
and we plan to do it.

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:56.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, I use cold
laser treatments.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.610 align:middle line:84%
One of the
radiologists, in fact,

00:32:57.610 --> 00:33:01.560 align:middle line:84%
the head of the radiology at MD
Anderson in Gilbert, Arizona,

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:04.140 align:middle line:84%
with patients that had to go
through high dose radiation

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:05.280 align:middle line:84%
and know they're
going to get burns.

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.529 align:middle line:84%
They know it's going to be
severe, but in their minds,

00:33:07.529 --> 00:33:10.170 align:middle line:84%
they have to go high enough to
get this cancer under control.

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:12.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: She has sent patients.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.700 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to do cold
laser treatments on them,

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.680 align:middle line:84%
and they don't get
the radiation burns.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, does that mean
that I decrease

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:19.530 align:middle line:90%
the effect of the radiation.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, neither does she.

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:23.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
a study together.

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:25.950 align:middle line:84%
We're designing it, and
we're going to look at that.

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How
difficult is it when

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:29.070 align:middle line:84%
you have someone
sitting in front

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:34.400 align:middle line:84%
of you that has a full belief
in the existing paradigm?

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:37.050 align:middle line:84%
You blast this thing
out at me, just

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:39.420 align:middle line:84%
sock it to me with
radiation and chemo,

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.010 align:middle line:84%
and you have the
knowledge you have,

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:43.320 align:middle line:90%
which is much more nuanced.

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.870 align:middle line:84%
I know you have to honor
what a person believes,

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:48.420 align:middle line:84%
because the belief is a
huge part of what happens.

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:49.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: I think that's
one of the biggest pieces.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How do you do this--

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.809 align:middle line:90%
walk this edge with people?

00:33:52.809 --> 00:33:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Well, and
it's both ways, Regina.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And so they sit in front
of me, they walk in,

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:57.906 align:middle line:90%
they have a paradigm.

00:33:57.906 --> 00:33:59.280 align:middle line:84%
They walk in with
what they think

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.740 align:middle line:84%
they believe, and all I ask
them is, how deeply do you

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:02.760 align:middle line:90%
believe it?

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And so if they have
already decided

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.210 align:middle line:90%
they want to go into chemo--

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:08.190 align:middle line:84%
the triad, chemo,
radiation, surgery,

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:10.467 align:middle line:84%
I'm usually in favor
of surgery, even

00:34:10.467 --> 00:34:12.300 align:middle line:84%
though some of these
therapies are saying we

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.980 align:middle line:90%
may not even be able to do that.

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.929 align:middle line:84%
But if they've
already decided that,

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:17.580 align:middle line:84%
then I say what
about things that we

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:21.630 align:middle line:84%
might be able to help you
use less, have less toxicity,

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:22.889 align:middle line:90%
be able to get better effect?

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:24.690 align:middle line:90%
Are you open to those things?

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:25.870 align:middle line:90%
They usually are.

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:29.070 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the statistics
show 80% of cancer patients

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:31.620 align:middle line:84%
are using some form of
alternative therapy,

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:34.800 align:middle line:84%
but the problem is 75% aren't
telling their oncologist

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.730 align:middle line:90%
they're doing it.

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you don't know
what that effect is or isn't.

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:40.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And we don't know the
effect, and that's a bad thing.

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Again, antioxidants,
put everybody

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:44.940 align:middle line:84%
on high dose vitamin
C. We know now there

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.159 align:middle line:84%
are times we should
not be doing that.

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Alkalinizing the body
to let fungal grow.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.839 align:middle line:84%
There are times, we
should not be doing that

00:34:51.839 --> 00:34:52.639 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:52.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So let me ask you a couple of
questions before we go further.

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:56.610 align:middle line:90%
We've got the time.

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Because one person I
found very fascinating

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.960 align:middle line:84%
was Dr. Simoncini out of
Italy, and so the use of sodium

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:02.760 align:middle line:90%
bicarbonate.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:02.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, what
is his piece of it?

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.270 align:middle line:84%
What was that
doing to the tumors

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:08.340 align:middle line:84%
within this whole
metabolic story?

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:11.247 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: That was kind of
the idea like 3-bromopyruvate,

00:35:11.247 --> 00:35:12.330 align:middle line:90%
what it was doing to that.

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:13.890 align:middle line:84%
It was so funny,
because it's been,

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:15.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, 15 years
ago, I was getting calls

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:16.766 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the night--

00:35:16.766 --> 00:35:19.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how people
found my cell phone at home,

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:20.880 align:middle line:84%
but they did-- from
all over the country,

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and somehow I had
gotten on his list.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:24.481 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: And I said, I don't--

00:35:24.481 --> 00:35:26.850 align:middle line:84%
I do IV therapy, but I
don't do sodium bicarb,

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:28.594 align:middle line:90%
nor am I licensed to do so.

00:35:28.594 --> 00:35:30.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not within anyone's
scope in the United States.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.481 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So it was that
same kind of philosophy.

00:35:33.481 --> 00:35:36.660 align:middle line:84%
But remember, we can take
things and try to destroy.

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:38.370 align:middle line:90%
Is it 3-bromopyruvate?

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:39.960 align:middle line:90%
Is it chemo, radiation?

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.470 align:middle line:84%
But if we want to say
what's really causing it--

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:46.560 align:middle line:84%
keep backing up, what's the
root of the problem-- we're back

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.120 align:middle line:84%
to this whole
mitochondrial piece.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, we always are.

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.496 align:middle line:84%
It's just that it
seemed like that

00:35:50.496 --> 00:35:53.550 align:middle line:84%
was such an elegant
system to inject

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:55.320 align:middle line:90%
sodium bicarbonate into tumors.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: But who's going to
pay all the money that it would

00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:59.920 align:middle line:90%
take to get that approved--

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --whenever
it's sodium bicarb.

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:03.860 align:middle line:90%
Nobody.

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:04.800 align:middle line:90%
Who profits from that?

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.170 align:middle line:90%
Who does--

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:05.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: They're not.

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:06.490 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, baking
soda, basically.

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.196 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And to say that it
worked, I don't see the data.

00:36:10.196 --> 00:36:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And my problem is too,
Regina, in writing

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.770 align:middle line:84%
my book is that trying to
say which clinics would

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:20.370 align:middle line:84%
I say that if I sent a patient
to that I thought that they

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:22.132 align:middle line:84%
were going to know
all of this knowledge

00:36:22.132 --> 00:36:24.090 align:middle line:84%
and be able to do all of
it, and really explain

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:26.520 align:middle line:84%
to the patient what
their options are,

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.070 align:middle line:84%
educate them, let
them know what we know

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and what we don't,
I didn't have any.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've got therapies now
that I believe in, that I know.

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And so when my
patients call me now

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.330 align:middle line:84%
with these resorts
consultations, or people

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:42.960 align:middle line:84%
who aren't patients, and they
want to just walk through this,

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:46.840 align:middle line:84%
I have to take it
from that point.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.080 align:middle line:84%
I want to know their
belief system right now,

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.790 align:middle line:84%
but I also want to
educate them and let

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:52.540 align:middle line:84%
them know what their
options are and where

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:53.581 align:middle line:90%
they're going to find it.

00:36:53.581 --> 00:36:56.172 align:middle line:84%
Can't wait till we build the
spot where they can come and do

00:36:56.172 --> 00:36:56.330 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:57.620 align:middle line:90%
Then we'll replicate it.

00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a dream.

00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yeah.

00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.980 align:middle line:84%
One other thing really quickly
is also that people think,

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:04.290 align:middle line:84%
oh my God, radiation,
and they're scared of it.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:06.150 align:middle line:90%
They're afraid of it.

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:09.110 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, you
look at, in some countries,

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:11.972 align:middle line:84%
like in Germany, where they
do very, very targeted--

00:37:11.972 --> 00:37:12.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Radiotherapy.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:13.730 align:middle line:90%
Yup.

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.950 align:middle line:90%
Radiation.

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:17.866 align:middle line:84%
Talk a little bit about
what's possible there.

00:37:17.866 --> 00:37:19.786 align:middle line:84%
And is that being done
at all in the US yet?

00:37:19.786 --> 00:37:20.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes, it is.

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:21.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.074 align:middle line:84%
So the US has gotten
better at the radiation,

00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:24.714 align:middle line:90%
using less in a certain spot.

00:37:24.714 --> 00:37:26.630 align:middle line:84%
There's different
technologies and techniques.

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:30.950 align:middle line:84%
But it's still the problem is
whatever of those tough cancer

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:33.170 align:middle line:84%
cells, those smart-- the
smartest, most aggressive

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:35.991 align:middle line:84%
ones that it doesn't get
to, they lay dormant,

00:37:35.991 --> 00:37:38.240 align:middle line:84%
they're going to come back
if we're not doing anything

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.157 align:middle line:90%
except that radiation.

00:37:39.157 --> 00:37:39.956 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:39.956 --> 00:37:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So it's
you're doing radiation

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:43.490 align:middle line:84%
is kind of like
surgery, we're just

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:46.070 align:middle line:84%
trying to get a bulk
of that mass out,

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:48.260 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes we
need to, it's so big.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:51.200 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting is
that we have patients that

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.120 align:middle line:84%
have documented sizes of
tumors, and we say, listen,

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.180 align:middle line:84%
if you will get on
the ketogenic diet

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.280 align:middle line:84%
and you will do this
hyperbaric for a few weeks

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.410 align:middle line:84%
before the surgery,
this may help

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:03.660 align:middle line:84%
you go through the
surgery better, easier,

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:04.460 align:middle line:90%
and heal up better.

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:05.876 align:middle line:84%
Guess what they're
finding though.

00:38:05.876 --> 00:38:07.900 align:middle line:84%
They go in and the
tumor has shrunk so much

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:08.180 align:middle line:90%
already on their own.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to say.

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:10.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: That we're
seeing over and over again.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can it
shrink to the point

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:15.350 align:middle line:90%
where it's not really an issue?

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Dr.
Seyfried believes yes.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And I will say I
believe so, yes.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Do we have the exact protocols
yet to be able to do that?

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:23.782 align:middle line:90%
No, but we're close.

00:38:23.782 --> 00:38:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But what if--

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, someone comes in and
they have a large mass.

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:29.920 align:middle line:84%
Now they've gone through
that protocol, the ketogenics

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:30.800 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And now this thing
is shrunken way down.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to take action
on it at that point?

00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Well,
the action would be

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.150 align:middle line:84%
what you've been doing,
what already shrunk it.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I was saying.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Stay on
the ketogenic diet.

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Stay on all these
things that we did--

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:41.288 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Stay on that.

00:38:41.288 --> 00:38:43.496 align:middle line:84%
Then maybe you can get rid
of the invasive treatments

00:38:43.496 --> 00:38:44.455 align:middle line:90%
once that's discovered.

00:38:44.455 --> 00:38:46.579 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And that's all
of these treatments, where

00:38:46.579 --> 00:38:48.680 align:middle line:84%
it's seeing them as
standalone monotherapies.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.750 align:middle line:84%
We still have to
prove that before it

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:52.450 align:middle line:90%
becomes "standard" of care.

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:53.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: We have to prove that.

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.450 align:middle line:84%
But what we're seeing
is we believe they can.

00:38:56.450 --> 00:39:00.140 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, most
of them work very well

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.280 align:middle line:84%
with traditional
medicine, in the meantime.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:03.650 align:middle line:90%
In the meantime.

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:04.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: That's
the beauty of it.

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's go on to
some of the other therapies

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.620 align:middle line:90%
that are coming up.

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:09.029 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Well, there's a lot.

00:39:09.029 --> 00:39:10.820 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to think,
who did I miss out?

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know--

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Oh, Travis
Christofferson.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I was gonna
ask you about Travis.

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.310 align:middle line:10%
>>WORDEN: So Travis, you had on
the show, and he talked about,

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.620 align:middle line:10%
you know--

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:17.100 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The history of cancer.

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.516 align:middle line:10%
>>WORDEN: --he wrote that book,
"Tripping Over the Truth."

00:39:19.516 --> 00:39:20.330 align:middle line:10%
Fantastic.

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:22.100 align:middle line:10%
He found out about
a group, they're

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.950 align:middle line:10%
called Care Oncology, out of
the United Kingdom, right?

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And what they've
done is repurpose

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:30.530 align:middle line:84%
four commonly used drugs, and
they did it with the funding

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:31.790 align:middle line:90%
from the United Kingdom.

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And they went with
glioblastoma, which

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most aggressive,
fast growing tumors

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.280 align:middle line:90%
that we've got.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a brain tumor, so
anybody-- everybody that

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.750 align:middle line:84%
studies that says, hey, if
we can do anything with that,

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:43.380 align:middle line:84%
it's going to look good for
the rest of the cancers.

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: OK?

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:47.600 align:middle line:84%
So they did that and
they chose four drugs,

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.530 align:middle line:90%
and one was metformin.

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:50.330 align:middle line:90%
What does that do?

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:52.760 align:middle line:84%
That gets the glucose down
that we're talking about.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Another one was
an antiparasitic.

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:56.010 align:middle line:90%
Gets rid of the fungal--

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:56.810 align:middle line:90%
all that.

00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Back to the guts.

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.671 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes, back to the gut.

00:39:58.671 --> 00:40:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Doxycycline, which is an
antibiotic, but it does--

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:05.780 align:middle line:84%
it does affect
cellular respiration.

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:07.940 align:middle line:84%
But now, I was asking
Elliott about that.

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:08.650 align:middle line:90%
Remember, about the antibiotic?

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:11.021 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: We think it's
a matter of timing.

00:40:11.021 --> 00:40:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So the timing of it, the
way they're timing it,

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:14.540 align:middle line:90%
it's not causing that problem.

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:16.250 align:middle line:90%
And we're putting them on NAC.

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:17.690 align:middle line:90%
But the other one is a statin.

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Now everybody goes-- freaks out
about a statin, but statins,

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.180 align:middle line:84%
from day one, certain
statins showed

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:27.350 align:middle line:84%
that they were anti-tumorogenic,
they helped it not grow tumors,

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:28.960 align:middle line:90%
it helped it not metastasize.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So statins were,
at the beginning,

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.810 align:middle line:84%
looked at as maybe
a cancer drug.

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:36.080 align:middle line:84%
So this group does four
of those common drugs.

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:36.890 align:middle line:90%
It's inexpensive.

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:38.390 align:middle line:84%
They have come to
the United States.

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:41.142 align:middle line:84%
Travis has opened
up the first clinic.

00:40:41.142 --> 00:40:42.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Using
that same protocol.

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:43.599 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Same protocol.

00:40:43.599 --> 00:40:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's a doctor in
Arizona that we identified,

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:49.050 align:middle line:90%
he's identified--

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:50.870 align:middle line:84%
there's a compounding
pharmacist that I

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:53.960 align:middle line:84%
use that I introduced
him to, and they

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.370 align:middle line:90%
have packaged these four drugs.

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:56.660 align:middle line:90%
And so they are working--

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:59.060 align:middle line:84%
currently working with patients
across the United States

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:01.010 align:middle line:84%
with these four
repurposed drugs.

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:02.960 align:middle line:90%
Now they're collecting the data.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:03.990 align:middle line:90%
Is it standard of care?

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.790 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Does it have-- It went
through the phase one--

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:07.956 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's experimental,
but you sign off on it.

00:41:07.956 --> 00:41:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --it is
experimental, but they

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:12.250 align:middle line:84%
do have that good study
that came out of the UK.

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:13.400 align:middle line:90%
It's very promising.

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.280 align:middle line:90%
They have that study.

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.350 align:middle line:90%
It's been published.

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:17.060 align:middle line:84%
So he's got some
data to back him.

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:20.540 align:middle line:84%
They too are looking for
funding to go forward with this.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:23.930 align:middle line:84%
My thought too though
on that is that if we're

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:26.447 align:middle line:84%
going after those four
pathways with those drugs,

00:41:26.447 --> 00:41:28.280 align:middle line:84%
why couldn't we go after
those four pathways

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.560 align:middle line:90%
with natural substances?

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:29.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:31.745 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So we're going
to look at all that.

00:41:31.745 --> 00:41:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So do you have
natural substances that mirror

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.312 align:middle line:90%
the same effects of those?

00:41:35.312 --> 00:41:36.520 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: I think that we do.

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.940 align:middle line:90%
We identify them exactly?

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:39.680 align:middle line:84%
No, we have a lot
more research to do.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.440 align:middle line:84%
But I think, in time,
that that's very possible.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.086 align:middle line:84%
What is the name of
that clinic if someone

00:41:45.086 --> 00:41:46.210 align:middle line:90%
wants to reach out to them?

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:47.890 align:middle line:10%
>>WORDEN: I think
if they just look

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:49.260 align:middle line:10%
under Travis Christofferson.

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.100 align:middle line:10%
It's Care Oncology.

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:54.070 align:middle line:10%
That's for a very fast
aggressive stage four.

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:57.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could use it at
any stage of cancer, but--

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:59.320 align:middle line:84%
and they too are
very big believers

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:01.480 align:middle line:90%
in the metabolic cancer theory.

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.022 align:middle line:84%
That was part of
Travis's whole--

00:42:03.022 --> 00:42:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So all roads keep
leading back to this now.

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:05.710 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: We're all--

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:06.876 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're converging.

00:42:06.876 --> 00:42:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: We're all in agreement
that that is where we think

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:10.430 align:middle line:90%
most of the studies will lead.

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Starving cancers
of the sugars, period.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:12.960 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:15.100 align:middle line:84%
What about modified
citrus pectin,

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:16.390 align:middle line:90%
the MCP part of this story?

00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:18.730 align:middle line:90%
So that's newer to me.

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:22.240 align:middle line:10%
It's probably been about
nine or 10 months ago, maybe

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:26.830 align:middle line:10%
a little longer, Dr. Isaac
Elias invited me to dinner,

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:31.000 align:middle line:10%
and we sat and he showed me
about 2,000 studies, mouse

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.910 align:middle line:10%
studies at this point, although
there is a new human one

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:37.490 align:middle line:10%
that he's going to present next
week at Society of Integrative

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:38.290 align:middle line:10%
Oncology.

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:40.360 align:middle line:84%
I'll be presenting
there too, and he's

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.332 align:middle line:84%
going to let me talk
about it to you today.

00:42:42.332 --> 00:42:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Before it's--

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:44.264 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:42:44.264 --> 00:42:45.263 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: A piece of it.

00:42:45.263 --> 00:42:47.350 align:middle line:84%
But so he showed
me those studies,

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:49.457 align:middle line:84%
and what modified
citrus pectin is,

00:42:49.457 --> 00:42:51.040 align:middle line:84%
it's that white part
inside the fruit.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:53.091 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So when
it's concentrated--

00:42:53.091 --> 00:42:55.390 align:middle line:84%
and they modified into now
it's kind of like a drug,

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:57.760 align:middle line:90%
but it's from a fruit--

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.460 align:middle line:84%
that they started
noticing that this looked

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:01.690 align:middle line:90%
like it was working on many--

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:05.290 align:middle line:84%
preventing many types of cancer
or working in the mouse studies

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:08.360 align:middle line:84%
and in the Petri dish
studies that it was working.

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:09.820 align:middle line:84%
So everybody got
excited about it,

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:11.236 align:middle line:84%
and they said, we
need to discover

00:43:11.236 --> 00:43:12.560 align:middle line:90%
the mechanism of action.

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:13.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Because maybe then
we can make a drug off of this

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:16.370 align:middle line:90%
to do it, right?

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:16.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:18.481 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: They discovered
that what it does

00:43:18.481 --> 00:43:20.000 align:middle line:90%
is block galectin-3.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's just a pathway
up in our bodies of streams

00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:24.680 align:middle line:90%
that happen.

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.530 align:middle line:10%
But here's the beauty,
when you block galectin-3,

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:29.770 align:middle line:10%
it also protects from heart
disease, congestive heart

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:30.570 align:middle line:10%
failure.

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Reverses, in mice,
atherosclerosis.

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Reverses Alzheimer's
plaque in mice.

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Now we're in the
neurodegenerative,

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:38.491 align:middle line:90%
Parkinson's--

00:43:38.491 --> 00:43:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --all that,
the brain pathology.

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:42.620 align:middle line:90%
Most types of cancer.

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's a natural
heavy metal keylater.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Without having to go through our
EDTA and DMSA, all the things

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.310 align:middle line:84%
that we do that's
hard on the body,

00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:53.530 align:middle line:84%
it naturally keylates
heavy metals.

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:57.580 align:middle line:84%
There are many other pathways
that that galectin-3 blocks.

00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:59.857 align:middle line:90%
So I got super excited about it.

00:43:59.857 --> 00:44:00.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: So now-- and I
asked Dr. Elias about it,

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and we're in constant contact,
but what he's going to be

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.640 align:middle line:90%
presenting is this human--

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:13.360 align:middle line:84%
it's on prostate cancer, and I
think he had 48 prostate cancer

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:15.130 align:middle line:90%
patients that were on this MCP.

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And I can't give you the exact
data, because it's not out yet,

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:21.370 align:middle line:84%
but let's just say it's
very, very exciting.

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In terms of reducing
the tumors and so forth?

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: And
possible metastasis.

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:27.060 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
possible metastasis.

00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: I don't
want to misquote--

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: --what's not
out yet, but yes, it's

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.490 align:middle line:84%
very promising for
prostate cancer.

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And we know those
cell lines and then

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:39.560 align:middle line:84%
animal studies we expect it to
be for most types of cancer.

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:42.490 align:middle line:84%
So people are going to
say, yes, I want some.

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:42.820 align:middle line:90%
I want to take it.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So-- for to protect
my own, you know, body, right?

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:45.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a supplement.

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Yes, and that's one of
things I take on a daily base.

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:48.900 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.200 align:middle line:90%
I take it on a daily basis.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.990 align:middle line:84%
It's preventing-- oh,
works on diabetes.

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:53.790 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:55.550 align:middle line:84%
There's that metabolic
pathway, right?

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Works on
diabetes and obesity.

00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:58.660 align:middle line:90%
So I take it.

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:00.940 align:middle line:84%
You want to make
sure it is Pectasol,

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:05.807 align:middle line:84%

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:28.030 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:28.850 align:middle line:90%
So that's OK.

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:30.887 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so any
more of the alternative

00:49:30.887 --> 00:49:32.720 align:middle line:84%
therapies coming up
that we want to discuss?

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: There are some,
and I'll bring them.

00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:36.830 align:middle line:84%
But I won't say that
they're necessarily

00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:39.210 align:middle line:84%
100% into the
metabolic cancer world.

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:40.710 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
interesting ones.

00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:43.550 align:middle line:10%
Well, one of them, while I'm
looking, is oxaloacetate.

00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:46.040 align:middle line:10%
That is a molecule
that is actually,

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:49.310 align:middle line:10%
at this point, considered
a orphan drug because it

00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:52.640 align:middle line:10%
works so well on a glioblastoma,
again, that bad cancer.

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:53.840 align:middle line:90%
So now it's an orphan drug.

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:55.430 align:middle line:84%
It's in a phase
1 clinical trial.

00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:56.799 align:middle line:90%
That's something that's out.

00:49:56.799 --> 00:49:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What does
orphan drug mean?

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Orphan drug
means it's not a--

00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:03.170 align:middle line:84%
the FDA hasn't approved
it yet as a drug.

00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:08.330 align:middle line:84%
But they've let it be used in
the meantime as an orphan drug

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:09.807 align:middle line:90%
until it all plays out

00:50:09.807 --> 00:50:11.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it's
appearing to be beneficial.

00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And they do that with
pharmaceuticals as well.

00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:16.079 align:middle line:84%
They'll be orphan--
before they get there.

00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:16.980 align:middle line:90%
So that one's there.

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Another one is the
mistletoe study

00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:20.330 align:middle line:90%
at Johns Hopkins University.

00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:22.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's mistletoe IVs.

00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:24.460 align:middle line:84%
That has been used in
Europe for a long period.

00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:28.360 align:middle line:84%
The Believe Big foundation
is sponsoring that.

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:30.950 align:middle line:84%
That's ongoing, but they're
still looking for volunteers.

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:32.810 align:middle line:90%
It's in phase 1 clinical trial.

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:34.235 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, tell us a
little bit about mistletoe

00:50:34.235 --> 00:50:36.234 align:middle line:84%
and what they're doing
and what it's said to do.

00:50:36.234 --> 00:50:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: It kind of
acts like a chemotherapy.

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:41.100 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's more
protective to the normal cells.

00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:42.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not hurting normal cells.

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.960 align:middle line:84%
So what all these
therapies have in common--

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.880 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to go
after the bad guys

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:49.329 align:middle line:84%
and upregulate, or
strengthen, the healthy cells.

00:50:49.329 --> 00:50:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is this
out of Germany or--

00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: No, it's here.

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, it's here?

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:54.849 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Yeah, so that's
at Johns Hopkins University.

00:50:54.849 --> 00:50:56.780 align:middle line:90%
People can sign up for that now.

00:50:56.780 --> 00:50:58.610 align:middle line:84%
They can sign up for
that clinical trial.

00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:00.165 align:middle line:90%
It's ongoing.

00:51:00.165 --> 00:51:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
do a several year,

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:04.230 align:middle line:84%
and it's a double-blind,
placebo-controlled study.

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:07.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's an interesting
one that's available now

00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:08.360 align:middle line:90%
at Johns Hopkins.

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Also, music.

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes.

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's frequency,
like light and like color.

00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:14.400 align:middle line:90%
And your husband Barry--

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Well, and we're
doing studies on that too.

00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:19.980 align:middle line:84%
But if we go back to
the metabolic theory,

00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:21.920 align:middle line:90%
remember those two pathways--

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.570 align:middle line:90%
sugar and then stress.

00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:27.710 align:middle line:84%
If we're using-- in fact,
Dr. Seyfried and Dominic

00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:31.190 align:middle line:84%
and that same group did a study
with music as one of the arms.

00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And they found that by
using it for relaxation,

00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:37.430 align:middle line:84%
getting the body's nervous
system out of this run

00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:40.010 align:middle line:84%
from the bear thing,
that that helped shut off

00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:41.270 align:middle line:90%
that pathway as well.

00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:46.340 align:middle line:84%
So yes, music, because of the
stress reduction, meditation,

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:48.180 align:middle line:84%
all these things are
going to be helpful.

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:51.410 align:middle line:84%
We've got one going with
chemotherapy patients

00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:53.660 align:middle line:84%
right now getting IV
listening to music

00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:56.540 align:middle line:90%
and doing yoga at MD Anderson.

00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:58.970 align:middle line:84%
So even traditional
oncologists, they

00:51:58.970 --> 00:52:01.037 align:middle line:84%
know that that stress is
a big piece and anything

00:52:01.037 --> 00:52:02.870 align:middle line:84%
that we can do that's
not going to interfere

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:05.602 align:middle line:84%
with their therapies, because
you've got to understand.

00:52:05.602 --> 00:52:06.810 align:middle line:90%
They've got their hands tied.

00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:08.930 align:middle line:84%
They have to be within
standard of care.

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:11.020 align:middle line:84%
They can only offer
what they're told

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:12.800 align:middle line:90%
that they can-- is in the box.

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:15.200 align:middle line:84%
And we're saying,
play within the box.

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:18.080 align:middle line:84%
But let's open up things that
allow you to do the box that we

00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:20.060 align:middle line:90%
can show you will help the box.

00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
open that box up,

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:24.770 align:middle line:90%
and let's look at all of it.

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:27.080 align:middle line:84%
So we really do
not want to be seen

00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:30.350 align:middle line:84%
as we're against
traditional oncologists

00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:31.640 align:middle line:90%
or traditional care.

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:33.470 align:middle line:90%
We think there's a better way.

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:34.390 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:36.180 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to prove it.

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:39.570 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime, those
oncologists that are saying,

00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:41.550 align:middle line:84%
can you help with
the side effects?

00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:46.610 align:middle line:84%
I know that a lot of our
therapies are toxic on purpose.

00:52:46.610 --> 00:52:48.590 align:middle line:90%
But can we do better?

00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:49.940 align:middle line:90%
They're listening.

00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:51.710 align:middle line:84%
The Society for
Integrative Oncology,

00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:53.960 align:middle line:84%
next week, they
awarded me a workshop

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:55.159 align:middle line:90%
to talk about homeopathy.

00:52:55.159 --> 00:52:56.450 align:middle line:90%
That would've been unheard of--

00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
of the work you're

00:52:57.950 --> 00:53:00.440 align:middle line:90%
doing with the injections.

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.885 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: But I had
data to show them.

00:53:02.885 --> 00:53:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So do you think that--

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.680 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people think
doctors don't care.

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.720 align:middle line:84%
They're in it just to
protect their own butts

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:11.750 align:middle line:90%
and not have lawsuits.

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Do you think doctors really,
if they have it proven,

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:18.155 align:middle line:84%
that they really, at large,
would take up new information

00:53:18.155 --> 00:53:20.030 align:middle line:84%
and a new way to go
about doing these things?

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Yes, they do.

00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:23.180 align:middle line:84%
But they care
about the patients.

00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:25.385 align:middle line:84%
They also care about
their medical license, OK?

00:53:25.385 --> 00:53:28.850 align:middle line:84%
One person, even if the
patient agreed for therapy,

00:53:28.850 --> 00:53:29.840 align:middle line:90%
and they pass.

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:32.419 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you extended
their life by double.

00:53:32.419 --> 00:53:34.460 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these therapies
are showing the increase

00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:36.320 align:middle line:90%
of the lifespan by twice.

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Even though you did
that, their family

00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:41.460 align:middle line:84%
can come after you because you
stepped outside of that box.

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's a constant
fear for them,

00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:46.610 align:middle line:84%
which is not a good place
for any physician or healer

00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:47.660 align:middle line:90%
to be in.

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:52.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's why when we
start these centers,

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:54.440 align:middle line:84%
that we can actually
work in conjunction

00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:57.020 align:middle line:84%
with the medical centers,
with the hospitals,

00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:01.280 align:middle line:84%
with the oncologists under an
arm of IRBs and protection.

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Now we're all better, including
the patients and the doctors.

00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:07.777 align:middle line:84%
Were all going to get
to go, [SIGHS DEEPLY]..

00:54:07.777 --> 00:54:09.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because somehow,
the insurance companies

00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:11.409 align:middle line:90%
have to factor into this, right?

00:54:11.409 --> 00:54:12.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Some of
these will probably

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:15.020 align:middle line:84%
be standalone
cash-pay therapies.

00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, if it proves
out under a grant and IRBs,

00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:20.600 align:middle line:90%
they may become--

00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:23.720 align:middle line:84%
again, if it saves the
insurance company money,

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:26.120 align:middle line:84%
they may be included
under insurance pay.

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:29.120 align:middle line:84%
But for the meantime,
we're paying cash.

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:33.260 align:middle line:84%
I think that we have to think
about that 50% of cancers

00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:35.715 align:middle line:90%
can be prevented, right?

00:54:35.715 --> 00:54:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's not forget that whole
prevention standpoint, right?

00:54:38.090 --> 00:54:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
why we're talking.

00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.907 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:54:39.907 --> 00:54:41.114 align:middle line:90%
We've got a few minutes left.

00:54:41.114 --> 00:54:42.290 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about prevention.

00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:43.484 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about the guts.

00:54:43.484 --> 00:54:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the things
we must do for our guts.

00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:46.608 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's right.

00:54:46.608 --> 00:54:48.840 align:middle line:90%
So again, eating healthy.

00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And if we look back
where the studies are,

00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:54.710 align:middle line:84%
if we look at the different
types of diet, the only one--

00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:57.230 align:middle line:84%
there's clinical evidence,
but there's no real studies

00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:58.460 align:middle line:90%
on the Gerson diet.

00:54:58.460 --> 00:54:59.660 align:middle line:90%
There's just not.

00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:01.450 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean it's not
real and that it's not good.

00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:02.110 align:middle line:90%
It's just not there.

00:55:02.110 --> 00:55:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, they've
had a lot of good results

00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:04.300 align:middle line:90%
at the Gerson Clinic.

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Exactly.

00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:09.680 align:middle line:84%
But the Mediterranean diet
has studies behind it.

00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Now ketogenic has
studies behind it.

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.430 align:middle line:90%
So those are the two.

00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:15.036 align:middle line:90%
Paleo would like to have a few.

00:55:15.036 --> 00:55:16.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're going
to come up and do that.

00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:20.480 align:middle line:84%
But right now, those are the
two that actually have science.

00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And what I think they all agree
is that the microbiome-- we've

00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:25.430 align:middle line:90%
got to have good bugs in there.

00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:27.880 align:middle line:84%
It's all about the play of
the good bugs and bad bugs.

00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:29.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Healthy fats.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: All those
things, right?

00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:34.340 align:middle line:84%
All the nutrients,
if you study it,

00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:37.160 align:middle line:84%
there is not enough
hard, hard, hard science

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:40.520 align:middle line:84%
on any of the
"supplements" to say

00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:43.670 align:middle line:84%
we've got enough hard science
to say that it prevents cancer.

00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:44.514 align:middle line:90%
We believe it does.

00:55:44.514 --> 00:55:47.180 align:middle line:84%
We believe it can be protective,
and there are some good studies

00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:48.080 align:middle line:90%
behind it.

00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.810 align:middle line:84%
But if you ask me to give
you that proof, that's

00:55:50.810 --> 00:55:52.760 align:middle line:84%
why oncologists
are going, I don't

00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:54.110 align:middle line:90%
know what to tell you to take.

00:55:54.110 --> 00:55:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Now alpha-lipoic
acid, they'll let

00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:58.310 align:middle line:84%
me do that to
prevent neuropathies.

00:55:58.310 --> 00:56:00.560 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's an
antioxidant, so now I

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:03.380 align:middle line:84%
know not to do it
around certain therapies

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:05.900 align:middle line:90%
that the oncologist is doing.

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:10.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's just mindset,
exercise- huge.

00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:12.620 align:middle line:84%
That decreases
the rate of cancer

00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:14.580 align:middle line:90%
and increases your lifespan.

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:17.480 align:middle line:84%
The things we know--
calorie restriction,

00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:21.020 align:middle line:84%
make the microbiome with all
the good things that we know.

00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:23.360 align:middle line:90%
Eat a healthy, diverse diet.

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Get rid of the junk, the toxins,
the tobacco, all those things

00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:32.660 align:middle line:84%
that we know can cause
cancer, that we know that--

00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:34.740 align:middle line:90%
this body is amazing.

00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:36.500 align:middle line:90%
It knows how to heal.

00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:38.280 align:middle line:90%
It knows what to do.

00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:40.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just genetic.

00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:47.570 align:middle line:84%
If we have a twin, and we talked
about with the schizophrenia,

00:56:47.570 --> 00:56:50.160 align:middle line:84%
the second one only has
a 50% chance of doing it.

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:52.493 align:middle line:84%
So I tell patients who say,
well, everybody in my family

00:56:52.493 --> 00:56:53.510 align:middle line:90%
has had breast cancer.

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, if they have
a BRCA1 and 2,

00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:59.330 align:middle line:84%
I might consider talking to
them about certain procedures,

00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:01.070 align:middle line:90%
just for their peace of mind.

00:57:01.070 --> 00:57:03.500 align:middle line:84%
But I always remind them, just
because you have the gene,

00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:04.689 align:middle line:90%
does not mean it needs--

00:57:04.689 --> 00:57:06.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It needs
to express itself.

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:07.438 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: --it does not mean.

00:57:07.438 --> 00:57:10.600 align:middle line:84%
But can I tell you now
exactly, with that gene,

00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.900 align:middle line:84%
how to downregulate the bad
and upregulate the good?

00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:13.700 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:15.924 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going
to get where we can.

00:57:15.924 --> 00:57:17.090 align:middle line:90%
That's going to be exciting.

00:57:17.090 --> 00:57:18.280 align:middle line:90%
You've got this gene.

00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:19.080 align:middle line:90%
Guess what.

00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Now you need to do
this, this, and that.

00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:22.800 align:middle line:90%
Right now, all the basics.

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:25.279 align:middle line:84%
I've liked the people that
you have on your show, Regina,

00:57:25.279 --> 00:57:27.320 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of good
information out there right

00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:30.239 align:middle line:90%
now about stress and sugar.

00:57:30.239 --> 00:57:31.655 align:middle line:84%
We've got to block
those pathways.

00:57:31.655 --> 00:57:33.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We eat sugar
to reduce stress.

00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:35.046 align:middle line:90%
But it's not working for us.

00:57:35.046 --> 00:57:36.170 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: It's not working.

00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:38.220 align:middle line:84%
It's called meditation
and yoga and other things.

00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:38.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:41.830 align:middle line:84%
OK, just a really quick word,
because we didn't get into it.

00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:43.670 align:middle line:84%
You touched on it with
the Gerson Clinic,

00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:46.080 align:middle line:84%
which is basically juice,
juice, juice, juice, juice.

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Right.

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Flood the
body with fresh enzymes.

00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:52.100 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times the vegan
diet is flooding the body

00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:53.207 align:middle line:90%
with fresh enzymes.

00:57:53.207 --> 00:57:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Where do enzymes play
a role in all of this?

00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:56.164 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: Enzymes are good.

00:57:56.164 --> 00:57:58.550 align:middle line:84%
The only studies that
have been done on humans--

00:57:58.550 --> 00:58:01.070 align:middle line:84%
well, actually, sorry,
only male studies--

00:58:01.070 --> 00:58:04.604 align:middle line:84%
are pancreatic enzymes
or animal enzymes.

00:58:04.604 --> 00:58:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And those have
shown that they can

00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:07.307 align:middle line:90%
be helpful in mouse studies.

00:58:07.307 --> 00:58:08.390 align:middle line:90%
That's all we know so far.

00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:09.710 align:middle line:90%
And I love enzymes.

00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:12.440 align:middle line:84%
I can give a patient
with cancer some enzymes

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:14.510 align:middle line:84%
and not tell him to
do a bunch of sugar.

00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:16.640 align:middle line:84%
My philosophy is right
now, choose something

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.990 align:middle line:90%
you think that you can do.

00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:20.450 align:middle line:84%
But I will tell you, I had
patients on the ketogenic diet.

00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:21.860 align:middle line:90%
We shrunk those tumors.

00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:22.670 align:middle line:90%
They said, great.

00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:24.128 align:middle line:84%
They went Mediterranean
and started

00:58:24.128 --> 00:58:25.820 align:middle line:90%
eating fruit and vegetables.

00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:27.020 align:middle line:90%
And guess what.

00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:28.340 align:middle line:90%
The tumors began to grow again.

00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:29.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's documented.

00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:31.130 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I put them
right back on that keto,

00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:32.338 align:middle line:90%
they started shrinking again.

00:58:32.338 --> 00:58:33.810 align:middle line:84%
That's what I know
at this point.

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:34.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:58:34.610 --> 00:58:36.830 align:middle line:90%
So tell us what we look for.

00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Or is everybody different in
terms of a spectrum of enzymes

00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:41.210 align:middle line:90%
that can help?

00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: Well, again,
it's individualized,

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:44.760 align:middle line:90%
like all of this.

00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:45.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's the thing.

00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:46.881 align:middle line:84%
>>WORDEN: If they're
eating a healthy diet,

00:58:46.881 --> 00:58:48.757 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to do all of that.

00:58:48.757 --> 00:58:50.340 align:middle line:84%
You've got to look
at that individual.

00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:51.798 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when
they call, they

00:58:51.798 --> 00:58:53.387 align:middle line:90%
give me their stage of cancer.

00:58:53.387 --> 00:58:55.220 align:middle line:84%
I look at it and say,
here are the therapies

00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:56.930 align:middle line:90%
that you may want to consider.

00:58:56.930 --> 00:58:58.260 align:middle line:90%
And this is why.

00:58:58.260 --> 00:58:59.670 align:middle line:90%
But everybody's different.

00:58:59.670 --> 00:59:00.470 align:middle line:90%
It's personalized.

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:05.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, my dear, well gosh,
that's a brainstorm.

00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:08.590 align:middle line:84%
That's a lot of info
in one hour of time.

00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:10.280 align:middle line:90%
And I just wish you the best.

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:12.237 align:middle line:84%
And again, we're going
to put up on the screen

00:59:12.237 --> 00:59:14.570 align:middle line:84%
all these foundations that
are doing really good work so

00:59:14.570 --> 00:59:17.450 align:middle line:84%
that we, the consumer,
can start supporting

00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:19.159 align:middle line:84%
the heroes and the
good work out there.

00:59:19.159 --> 00:59:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>>WORDEN: That's exactly right.

00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And they'll start seeing
and hearing from us soon

00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:24.630 align:middle line:90%
about our foundation.

00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're
a hero of mine, OK?

00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:28.162 align:middle line:90%
