want to start with your life

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.477 align:middle line:90%
and earlier on in your life.

00:01:12.477 --> 00:01:14.352 align:middle line:84%
Let's start when you
were a little kid first,

00:01:14.352 --> 00:01:16.080 align:middle line:84%
but before we go on
to the events that

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.440 align:middle line:84%
happened at age 14,
in that you tended

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.840 align:middle line:84%
to put a big smile on
all of it, no matter

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.590 align:middle line:90%
what was going on underneath.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.140 align:middle line:90%
And we all have done it.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And we all know people who
literally that's their defense

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.980 align:middle line:84%
mechanism for living is
just paste a smile on it

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.200 align:middle line:84%
and laugh a lot, and
then the suffering

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.550 align:middle line:84%
is happening and
causing deeper troubles.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Sure.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
go about you when

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.000 align:middle line:84%
you were a kid first and
the nature of your family

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.930 align:middle line:90%
and your home life.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.490 align:middle line:10%
>>STABILE: Yeah, I
mean, I think also

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.520 align:middle line:10%
with what you're saying is I
feel really grateful that I was

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.660 align:middle line:10%
born with a personality that
steered its way to optimism

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.820 align:middle line:10%
a bit more naturally.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.390 align:middle line:10%
I have a lot of friends who
have to work a lot harder

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.340 align:middle line:10%
to get to a neutral
place, and some of us

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.822 align:middle line:10%
have an easier time being
a little more positive

00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:03.030 align:middle line:10%
and a little more optimistic.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.947 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is very
true, and that's almost

00:02:04.947 --> 00:02:06.360 align:middle line:90%
hard-wired in when you're born.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.615 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Absolutely.

00:02:06.615 --> 00:02:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You see it in babies.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: I believe it is.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.860 align:middle line:90%
It's personality.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: I'm so grateful
that I was wired kind of

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.410 align:middle line:90%
toward positivity and optimism.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.370 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to
work quite as hard.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.325 align:middle line:84%
And then after going through
some traumatic events, which

00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:19.325 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure we'll discuss--

00:02:19.325 --> 00:02:21.283 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, we're going
to discuss all of it.

00:02:21.283 --> 00:02:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Yeah, I mean, I
started to notice in my life

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.200 align:middle line:84%
the ways in which that smile
that was always on my face

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.450 align:middle line:90%
wasn't always authentic.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.418 align:middle line:84%
It was hiding a mountain of
pain and a mountain of things

00:02:33.418 --> 00:02:35.460 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't really want
to look at because pain

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.690 align:middle line:90%
is hard to look at.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, even
if you are an optimist.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.557 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Absolutely.

00:02:39.557 --> 00:02:40.560 align:middle line:90%
And we all have pain.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, no matter how spirited
you are in your personality,

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.653 align:middle line:84%
life is going to throw some
things at you that are tough.

00:02:46.653 --> 00:02:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's going to
do that with everyone.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.403 align:middle line:84%
And it's a matter of
whether you can address

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:55.240 align:middle line:84%
it head-on in the moment, which
a lot of times is not possible.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.870 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times people,
for their own reasons

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.380 align:middle line:84%
of defending and protecting
something in themselves,

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.510 align:middle line:84%
choose not to
experience it fully

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.053 align:middle line:84%
as it's rolling
out in the moment.

00:03:05.053 --> 00:03:05.970 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Absolutely.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I would
say maybe most people.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Yeah--

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe
even most people.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.905 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: --and that's OK.

00:03:09.905 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:90%
That's the thing is--

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.820 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: --that's OK.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.510 align:middle line:90%
Certainly--

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you have
to go excavate later.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.020 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Absolutely,
when you have

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.140 align:middle line:84%
a little distance, a little
more perspective maybe.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Because so often when we're
hit by trauma, by shock,

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.180 align:middle line:84%
by overwhelming situations,
you can't process

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.083 align:middle line:84%
it or you can only
process it to some degree.

00:03:30.083 --> 00:03:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
be with it however

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.917 align:middle line:84%
you're able to be
with it, which I

00:03:32.917 --> 00:03:35.860 align:middle line:84%
think is such an important
thing to convey to people.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not about right and
wrong ways of doing things.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.030 align:middle line:84%
It's about, for me,
making space for however

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm showing up in my
life and understanding

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.330 align:middle line:90%
that, as human beings, it's OK.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:90%
You're human.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's OK.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And you're right, there's
not a right or wrong way

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.230 align:middle line:84%
because there's an
upside and a downside

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.300 align:middle line:90%
to doing it either way.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.680 align:middle line:90%
They both have their challenges.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Yeah.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.605 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in a place
in my life now where

00:04:00.605 --> 00:04:03.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm much more inclined
to face the things I'm

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.380 align:middle line:84%
going through head-on
much sooner because I've

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.460 align:middle line:84%
seen in my life how
when we avoid and escape

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and we don't look at our
pain, when we don't take

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.529 align:middle line:84%
responsibility for how we're
showing up in our lives,

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:18.329 align:middle line:84%
it just builds and
builds within us.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And it creates problems we're
aware of, it creates problems

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.430 align:middle line:84%
we're not aware of, when,
for me, part of growth,

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.590 align:middle line:84%
part of healing,
part of evolution

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.530 align:middle line:84%
is understanding I
can look at this now.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:90%
I can hold space for the pain.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:90%
I can sit with what I'm feeling.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.410 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to take me down.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we
tend to have fear

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.407 align:middle line:84%
if we're really with
our pain that we're not

00:04:44.407 --> 00:04:45.240 align:middle line:90%
going to survive it.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That you're
not going to survive it.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.513 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: And so we're
escaping and numbing

00:04:48.513 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:84%
and all of that stuff that
doesn't ultimately serve much.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and I've only
recently realized in my own

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.020 align:middle line:84%
life, because I tend
to live in the moment--

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very ordered
toward that to a fault--

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.100 align:middle line:90%
but that includes pain.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.771 align:middle line:84%
So when things are happening,
like a five-year-old,

00:05:06.771 --> 00:05:08.580 align:middle line:84%
something happens
that's hurtful,

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.420 align:middle line:84%
I am devastated and in absolute
despair right then and there.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.890 align:middle line:90%
I cannot see a way forward.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.410 align:middle line:84%
I cannot see a day
will ever be brighter.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.765 align:middle line:90%
It's just like a five-year-old.

00:05:17.765 --> 00:05:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: You're a feeler.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.240 align:middle line:90%
You'll feel it all.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: My poor husband
has to deal with it.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.630 align:middle line:90%
So I'm devastated.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.120 align:middle line:84%
But then like a five-year-old,
I've gone through it.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.490 align:middle line:90%
And when it's done, it's done.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.894 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Yeah, you're
not holding it for months

00:05:28.894 --> 00:05:28.942 align:middle line:90%
and years--

00:05:28.942 --> 00:05:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There
isn't anything to--

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.306 align:middle line:90%
no, nothing's lingering.

00:05:31.306 --> 00:05:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: --and
keeping grudges.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.402 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:05:33.402 --> 00:05:35.480 align:middle line:84%
But the pain, feeling
like you're not going to--

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.280 align:middle line:84%
I brought it up because
you just mentioned this--

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.738 align:middle line:84%
the pain of feeling
like you're not

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:42.210 align:middle line:84%
going to survive in the
moment is very intense.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
downside to processing

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.470 align:middle line:84%
in the moment,
because you're right,

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.813 align:middle line:90%
that's exactly how it feels.

00:05:47.813 --> 00:05:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
do get through it.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.290 align:middle line:84%
So I want to start with
your life as a young kid

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.410 align:middle line:90%
and the nature of your family.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: The nature
of my family was,

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.120 align:middle line:84%
in some ways, profoundly
dysfunctional.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.040 align:middle line:90%
There was a lot of addiction.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.740 align:middle line:84%
So I was the youngest
of seven kids.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.240 align:middle line:90%
Six of us are living.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.902 align:middle line:84%
One brother died from
a heroin overdose.

00:06:10.902 --> 00:06:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We'll
talk about him too.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Yeah, so
growing up, my father

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.450 align:middle line:84%
was a gambling addict, and my
brother was a heroin addict.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And the energy of addiction
was very prominent

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.380 align:middle line:90%
in our household.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.036 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I reflect back on
it, it's like, that was just--

00:06:30.036 --> 00:06:31.328 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's what you knew.

00:06:31.328 --> 00:06:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: --what
was going on, yeah.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.530 align:middle line:84%
So I'd visit friends' homes, and
I definitely had a sense that--

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.870 align:middle line:84%
even though I think everybody
has their own dysfunction,

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.820 align:middle line:84%
of course, in their
homes, I definitely

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.630 align:middle line:84%
had a sense that my
friends' families seem

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:45.870 align:middle line:90%
to be a little more stable--

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:46.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Together.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: --seeming.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.250 align:middle line:90%
Together.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they were,
maybe they weren't.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.850 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, so we grew up with a
lot of instability around that.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.910 align:middle line:84%
I was the youngest kid,
though, so I was aware

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.480 align:middle line:84%
as I could possibly be
because I was a curious kid.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.360 align:middle line:84%
But also, everything
was being kept from me.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.240 align:middle line:84%
So I discovered things
by discovering them,

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.000 align:middle line:84%
and you can't really
keep addiction

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.820 align:middle line:84%
from the people who are in
the house experiencing it.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.760 align:middle line:84%
When my brother is
coming around and where

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.280 align:middle line:84%
everyone's hiding their
money and locking the--

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.527 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Valuables.

00:07:19.527 --> 00:07:21.235 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: --doors,
you know what I mean?

00:07:21.235 --> 00:07:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And that was just a
real part of life.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.680 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up in that, but
also grew up with friends

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.710 align:middle line:84%
and grew up playing
outside all the time.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.970 align:middle line:90%
It didn't feel traumatic.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:36.470 align:middle line:84%
I think in retrospect,
the most traumatic aspect

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:42.860 align:middle line:84%
of my upbringing before
14 was just not feeling

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.200 align:middle line:84%
loved by my dad, not having
a relationship with him,

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:45.770 align:middle line:90%
not really--

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not
understanding he probably

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.200 align:middle line:84%
wasn't capable of that kind
of love that you wanted.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Yeah, and, I mean,
my mom had me when she was 42.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.370 align:middle line:84%
In 1971, that was
old to have a kid.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't planned,
and my parents

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.460 align:middle line:90%
had done their parenting.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they were done.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.604 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: So the last few
of us who came around--

00:08:01.604 --> 00:08:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're the
runt of the litter.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.080 align:middle line:90%
They were kind of just done.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah, there
was some of that.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think in some ways
in my life now today

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.610 align:middle line:84%
and the past five or
so years of my life,

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.600 align:middle line:84%
I've really come to see the
ways in which not having

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.310 align:middle line:84%
that father-son relationship
that you might hope for has

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.650 align:middle line:90%
really impacted my life.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I could
see a commercial

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.090 align:middle line:84%
with a father and a
son who love each other

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:30.230 align:middle line:90%
and burst into tears.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:31.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, wow, that pain--

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:32.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's still in you.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: --that
wound is still in me.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.360 align:middle line:84%
But I think at the time, it
just manifested as anger.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.200 align:middle line:90%
I hated my dad.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.027 align:middle line:90%
I thought he was a jerk.

00:08:41.027 --> 00:08:42.610 align:middle line:84%
I was going to swear,
but I held back.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah, I got you.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: So, yeah.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, so
let's move to 14,

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.290 align:middle line:84%
and set the stage
for us, the location,

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:54.260 align:middle line:84%
everything that was
happening at that time that

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.553 align:middle line:90%
resulted in this event.

00:08:55.553 --> 00:08:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Yeah, well,
I had spent the weekend

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.430 align:middle line:84%
with my sister Rose and her
husband Joe and my nephew Joey.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And my parents had a
fruit market convenience

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.570 align:middle line:84%
store in downtown
Detroit in an area that

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.140 align:middle line:84%
wasn't so great
as far as safety,

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.860 align:middle line:90%
and I used to work there a lot.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.500 align:middle line:84%
This might give you some insight
into my parent's parenting

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.650 align:middle line:84%
skills, but at maybe nine
years old, 10 years old,

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:26.750 align:middle line:84%
I would be working behind this
thick bulletproof glass running

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.670 align:middle line:90%
the lotto and lottery machine.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I
was like the king

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.175 align:middle line:84%
because there'd be lines of
people giving me their numbers

00:09:33.175 --> 00:09:34.590 align:middle line:90%
and I'd be punching it in.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a power
position in the neighborhood.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Exactly.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.722 align:middle line:84%
And they're just looking at
this little kid handing out

00:09:39.722 --> 00:09:41.295 align:middle line:90%
lottery tickets.

00:09:41.295 --> 00:09:42.920 align:middle line:84%
So I spent a lot of
time at that store,

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.690 align:middle line:84%
but also was aware
that my uncle was

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:51.800 align:middle line:84%
shot at that store and
paralyzed years before,

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.750 align:middle line:84%
and things happened
around there.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And this one morning when
I was 14, my parents,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.170 align:middle line:90%
they were murdered.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:05.210 align:middle line:84%
They had come into the
store, and their one employee

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.130 align:middle line:90%
had been stabbed by this man.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.800 align:middle line:84%
I guess they were
in a fight over--

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.330 align:middle line:84%
no one really knows
the full story.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
assumptions about the story.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.610 align:middle line:84%
But my father called 911,
and the man was still there

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.720 align:middle line:84%
and ended up shooting
both of my parents

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.420 align:middle line:90%
and killing them as well.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, that's
something most of us

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:25.320 align:middle line:90%
can't begin to fathom.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.730 align:middle line:84%
It's just kind of
shocking hearing about it.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:84%
But there were other
circumstances surrounding it

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.580 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps made it
even more challenging

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.640 align:middle line:84%
in that your mother-- you
had been begging your mom

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.120 align:middle line:90%
to stop going to the store

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Yeah.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.542 align:middle line:84%
It was her last
week at the store.

00:10:39.542 --> 00:10:40.750 align:middle line:90%
It was her last days at the--

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:41.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She had
finally agreed to retire.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:41.490 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: --store.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.200 align:middle line:84%
She finally realized
it because it

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.420 align:middle line:84%
made me really nervous
that she was still--

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.690 align:middle line:84%
and it was unnecessary for
her to be down there working.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.420 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.125 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she was four
days away from her retirement

00:10:54.125 --> 00:10:55.650 align:middle line:90%
to work in the store.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.861 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Yeah, so
the timing was insane.

00:10:58.861 --> 00:11:00.194 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The timing was insane.

00:11:00.194 --> 00:11:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Yeah, the
timing was insane.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because here you had
your hopes up for her safety,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.540 align:middle line:84%
and then the
unimaginable happens.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Yeah.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:09.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how did
you find out about this?

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.917 align:middle line:84%
How did this work
through your family?

00:11:11.917 --> 00:11:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: So I was spending
that weekend with my eldest

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:19.620 align:middle line:84%
sister Rose, and she got a
call from my brother Jimmy

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:23.580 align:middle line:84%
that our parents' car was
parked outside the store.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.100 align:middle line:84%
But the gates weren't
open, and it was well

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.040 align:middle line:84%
past the time the store
should have been open.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And my sister and I both had
a horrible feeling inside.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:36.600 align:middle line:84%
It just didn't make any sense,
and had a really bad feeling.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And we drove to my
brother-in-law's-- my sister

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Rose's husband Joe had a
deli called the Ham Palace,

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:45.580 align:middle line:90%
and we drove there.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And my sister Kim
also worked there,

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.045 align:middle line:84%
so we were just kind
of waiting there.

00:11:50.045 --> 00:11:52.170 align:middle line:84%
He closed the restaurant,
and we were waiting there

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.500 align:middle line:84%
for my brother to go downtown
and find out what had happened.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So when my brother
came to the store,

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.003 align:middle line:90%
that's when we found out.

00:11:59.003 --> 00:12:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Had your
parents already

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.130 align:middle line:90%
been taken away at that point?

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:03.970 align:middle line:90%
And do you know what happened?

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:04.170 align:middle line:90%
Don't even know.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:04.755 align:middle line:90%
It's like shock.

00:12:04.755 --> 00:12:05.525 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: I honestly
don't remember.

00:12:05.525 --> 00:12:06.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.265 align:middle line:84%
I know he had to go
identify their bodies.

00:12:08.265 --> 00:12:09.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your brother did.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: My brother did.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.282 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know where they
were when he did that.

00:12:12.282 --> 00:12:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So seven kids now.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:15.750 align:middle line:90%
Now, some of them are grown.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.520 align:middle line:84%
You're not, but some
of them are grown.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Most of them.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:18.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank God.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:19.890 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Yeah, yeah.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So they're--

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: But in their
20s and early 30s.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:24.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:29.660 align:middle line:84%
So how did this initially
hit the whole family

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.570 align:middle line:84%
in terms of everybody reacts
to things differently,

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:36.410 align:middle line:90%
and then you specifically?

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: It was shock.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:40.280 align:middle line:90%
That time is such a blur.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, a lot
of my childhood I

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:46.490 align:middle line:84%
don't really remember either,
I think, before that time.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.890 align:middle line:84%
It was just a shock
and horror to us all.

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think interestingly, the
way in which my siblings and I,

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.270 align:middle line:84%
we all dealt with it in a
very similar way, which was we

00:12:56.270 --> 00:13:01.100 align:middle line:84%
all shut it in and didn't
talk about it with each other,

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.200 align:middle line:84%
didn't process it
with each other.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't like we
agreed to do it that way,

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.130 align:middle line:84%
but we all kind of
just did it that way.

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:12.150 align:middle line:84%
So I was dealing with this
internally really on my own.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:16.460 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't talk about
it with anybody.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Outside the time
when it happened,

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:middle line:84%
when there were lots of tears,
I would cry once a year.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.470 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like clockwork
and just have a meltdown cry

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:29.900 align:middle line:84%
precipitated by who knows
what, maybe a conversation

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.400 align:middle line:84%
with people, maybe
drinking too much

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.210 align:middle line:90%
in college, whatever it was.

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:36.440 align:middle line:90%
And then lock it away.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.080 align:middle line:84%
For me personally,
it felt like it

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.290 align:middle line:84%
was too overwhelming for people
to receive the information,

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.930 align:middle line:84%
and it was too overwhelming
for me to be with people

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:46.500 align:middle line:90%
when they were hearing about it.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:52.000 align:middle line:84%
So I created a big secret
around it, which was--

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.470 align:middle line:90%
it took a lot of energy.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:55.507 align:middle line:84%
Because I moved in
with my sister, so

00:13:55.507 --> 00:13:56.590 align:middle line:90%
I had to transfer schools.

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.300 align:middle line:90%
And this was in ninth grade.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.210 align:middle line:84%
It was at a time when
I was also coming

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.485 align:middle line:84%
to terms with my sexuality,
not being straight.

00:14:04.485 --> 00:14:07.600 align:middle line:90%


00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I was carrying
a lot of secrets.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And I moved to this
new school, and I

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.500 align:middle line:90%
became a master manipulator.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.110 align:middle line:84%
If conversations
with people were ever

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:20.590 align:middle line:84%
going to steer their
way toward family talk,

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:23.235 align:middle line:84%
I would manipulate them
away so people didn't ask me

00:14:23.235 --> 00:14:24.610 align:middle line:84%
about my family
and I didn't have

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.357 align:middle line:84%
to reveal that I
didn't have parents

00:14:26.357 --> 00:14:28.690 align:middle line:84%
or that they were murdered
because that wasn't something

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.540 align:middle line:84%
that the kids I was
around could relate to.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.190 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't want to be pitied.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:33.625 align:middle line:90%
It was just--

00:14:33.625 --> 00:14:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: --all
of it was awful.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It would mark you.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: And I
felt like a freak.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:37.425 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, sure.

00:14:37.425 --> 00:14:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: I felt like a
freak for being gay and not

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.460 align:middle line:84%
really understanding
what I was experiencing,

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.418 align:middle line:84%
and felt like a real
freak for being an orphan.

00:14:44.418 --> 00:14:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For being
an orphan, yeah.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:47.825 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: And
the last thing you

00:14:47.825 --> 00:14:50.590 align:middle line:84%
want to be in high school
in ninth grade is a freak.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.855 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a new kid at a
new school, so it was--

00:14:52.855 --> 00:14:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So did you
have to hide all of it?

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Did you have to hide
being gay and all of it?

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Oh, yeah,
gay, never-- yeah, that

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:58.510 align:middle line:90%
was for sure.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:00.052 align:middle line:84%
The parents stuff
eventually came out

00:15:00.052 --> 00:15:01.810 align:middle line:84%
because I would have
friends, and they

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:02.680 align:middle line:90%
would become close friends.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And they'd come
over, and they would

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.177 align:middle line:84%
see I was living with my sister,
and they'd ask questions.

00:15:06.177 --> 00:15:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was, for
me, Regina, always

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.360 align:middle line:84%
such a profound
relief when people

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.640 align:middle line:84%
knew because it was
one less person I

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.800 align:middle line:90%
had to keep that secret around.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And then at one
point in high school,

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.870 align:middle line:84%
I think around my junior
year, unbeknownst to me,

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.750 align:middle line:84%
my uncle nominated
me-- once a week,

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.060 align:middle line:84%
the "Detroit Free Press,"
which was the main paper,

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.790 align:middle line:84%
would profile a
student of the week,

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:29.780 align:middle line:84%
and my uncle
nominated me for it.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.938 align:middle line:84%
And I got selected to be
the student of the week.

00:15:31.938 --> 00:15:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was because I
was an all A student and class

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.630 align:middle line:90%
president and that kind of kid.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.760 align:middle line:84%
What I didn't understand
was when the guy came

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.920 align:middle line:84%
to interview me,
the journalist, he

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.720 align:middle line:90%
kept asking about my parents.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I don't want
to talk about my parents.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And what I came to
understand after,

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:51.468 align:middle line:84%
the only reason I had been
selected as student of the week

00:15:51.468 --> 00:15:53.260 align:middle line:84%
was not because I was
a straight A student.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.552 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of straight
A student class presidents

00:15:55.552 --> 00:15:56.650 align:middle line:90%
in the Detroit area.

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:58.390 align:middle line:84%
It's because my
parents were murdered

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and I managed to
maintain that composure

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.430 align:middle line:84%
and be a great student
and function basically.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:09.788 align:middle line:84%
I was specifically selected
because of that experience.

00:16:09.788 --> 00:16:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so everyone knew.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: So then it was
posted outside the office.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And at first, it
was, for me, seeing

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:18.620 align:middle line:84%
that there when I walked
into school, I was like, no.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And then what I
realized after a day,

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.470 align:middle line:84%
it was one of the biggest
gifts for me in high school

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:25.630 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of kids
did come up to me.

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:28.280 align:middle line:84%
But what I understood then
is like, everyone knows now.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:28.812 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you don't
have to hide anymore.

00:16:28.812 --> 00:16:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: It's not a secret.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to hide it.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.950 align:middle line:90%
It's one less thing to--

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:36.160 align:middle line:84%
our secrets kill
us, and so it was

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.450 align:middle line:90%
one less thing to worry about.

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and then your
brother a few years later,

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:41.650 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.645 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Yeah, about
nine years later.

00:16:44.645 --> 00:16:45.445 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, he died.

00:16:45.445 --> 00:16:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He finally
died of his overdose.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:47.470 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Yeah.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you'd been really
angry at him at the time.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.860 align:middle line:84%
You said he was a loving
big-hearted guy with just

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:57.280 align:middle line:84%
a loving word for everyone,
but too sensitive to live

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.990 align:middle line:90%
in this world is your opinion.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.650 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: That was
my sense of it, yeah.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's your
observation of him.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:01.540 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Yeah.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so he
resorted to whatever

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:06.740 align:middle line:84%
could take the pain away,
which put you all at risk.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Yeah, I
mean, my brother Ricky

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.560 align:middle line:90%
was 18 years my senior.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.440 align:middle line:84%
And as far as our family
kind of can put together,

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.670 align:middle line:90%
that's when he started using.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:16.901 align:middle line:90%
So I only knew him--

00:17:16.901 --> 00:17:17.859 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As an addict.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: --through
the lens of addiction.

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And he was loving and
beautiful and wonderful,

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and he created so much
heartbreak in our family

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:32.110 align:middle line:84%
that it was hard for me
to separate his actions.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.480 align:middle line:84%
It was hard for me
in any way to accept

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.170 align:middle line:84%
that he wasn't consciously
choosing this all the time.

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And so as a kid, what
I'm seeing is he's

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:44.590 align:middle line:84%
consciously choosing to hurt
our family by these choices

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:45.890 align:middle line:90%
to use heroin.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:47.200 align:middle line:90%
So there was a lot of anger.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.450 align:middle line:90%
There was a lot of resentment.

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.620 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of hatred
even though I loved him.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And there was, in our
family, expectation.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.660 align:middle line:84%
We all knew someday
we were going

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:59.020 align:middle line:84%
to receive a call about
our brother that he died.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And when my sister called,
she left a message.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And I could-- her voice,
"call me right away,"

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:06.280 align:middle line:84%
the very first
thing is Ricky died.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.280 align:middle line:90%
He OD'd.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And there was, for me, a sense
of peace around it, not even

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:18.100 align:middle line:84%
for myself because I didn't
have a lot of contact with him,

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:84%
but I thought, wow, he's not
going to be in prisons anymore.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.070 align:middle line:84%
He's not going to be
in smack dens anymore.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.397 align:middle line:90%
Whatever his life was--

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's free.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:27.105 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: He's free.

00:18:27.105 --> 00:18:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, understandably.

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So even though there's
some peace around it,

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:36.790 align:middle line:84%
it's really kind of topping
off the tragedy of the family

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:37.900 align:middle line:90%
dynamic.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And now you get to a
point where you ended up

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.480 align:middle line:84%
in kind of a New Age shop,
working in a New Age shop.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.452 align:middle line:90%
Was it in LA?

00:18:44.452 --> 00:18:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: No, Bay Area

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bay Area.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:46.852 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: San Francisco,
Haight-Ashbury district.

00:18:46.852 --> 00:18:47.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Haight-Ashbury.

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:47.942 align:middle line:90%
Right, that's right.

00:18:47.942 --> 00:18:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Yeah, Upper Haight.

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.400 align:middle line:84%
So you end up working
in this New Age shop.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.618 align:middle line:84%
Now obviously, you
already have this--

00:18:56.618 --> 00:18:58.160 align:middle line:84%
first of all, do
you think you became

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.170 align:middle line:84%
more of a high
achiever and performer

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:02.210 align:middle line:90%
because of what had happened?

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Or would you have
been that way anyway?

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Oh my God,
I was such a stress--

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.180 align:middle line:84%
at eight, I was stressed
out about school--

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:08.285 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tests.

00:19:08.285 --> 00:19:09.743 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: --and
always getting As.

00:19:09.743 --> 00:19:11.360 align:middle line:90%
No, I was always that way.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.910 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:15.650 align:middle line:84%
The fact that I stayed that
way after losing my parents,

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:19.640 align:middle line:84%
for me, feels like in
part luck because I

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.550 align:middle line:84%
don't feel like I made
conscious choices at 14.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.470 align:middle line:84%
But something in me knew
to lock it away for now

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:27.958 align:middle line:84%
and just stay on this path,
move in that direction.

00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And at some point in your life,
you're going to deal with it.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.620 align:middle line:84%
But as a 14-year-old, I
didn't know that consciously.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:37.440 align:middle line:84%
I feel so grateful that
that's the way I was guided.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.860 align:middle line:90%
So you were guided that way.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:40.760 align:middle line:90%
You continued on.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.880 align:middle line:84%
You excelled in
academics and so forth.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.495 align:middle line:84%
And now you're in
a New Age shop,

00:19:46.495 --> 00:19:47.620 align:middle line:90%
which was a life-changing--

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Isn't
everyone in the Bay Area

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:49.531 align:middle line:90%
at some point in a New Age shop?

00:19:49.531 --> 00:19:51.395 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh gosh, I mean,
I lived in Sedona 20 years.

00:19:51.395 --> 00:19:51.655 align:middle line:90%
Let's not even go there.

00:19:51.655 --> 00:19:53.300 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Oh yeah,
you know New Age.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh boy, yes, I do.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.840 align:middle line:84%
So now you're in a New
Age shop, and turned out,

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.960 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like a
turning point for you.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.985 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: It was.

00:20:01.985 --> 00:20:05.090 align:middle line:84%
I feel called to say one
more thing about my brother

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:09.260 align:middle line:84%
and about addiction because
my attitudes around addiction

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.190 align:middle line:90%
have shifted a lot in my life.

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And when I was angry
with my brother,

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.810 align:middle line:84%
it was because I felt like
he didn't have a choice--

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:18.740 align:middle line:84%
or because he was
making the choice.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I came to view
addiction as a disease

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and that he didn't
have a choice.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.080 align:middle line:90%
And then I came to view--

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
addiction is a disease,

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.700 align:middle line:90%
but I also believe it's more.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.160 align:middle line:84%
I believe the way it
affects people and impacts

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.670 align:middle line:84%
us is very different,
and that my brother died,

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:37.670 align:middle line:84%
and when he did, I felt like
it was the only option for him

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:39.980 align:middle line:84%
because he was never
going to overcome it.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.503 align:middle line:84%
And it's not how I see
addiction at all anymore.

00:20:42.503 --> 00:20:44.420 align:middle line:84%
I believe that if you're
living and breathing,

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:47.060 align:middle line:84%
no matter how dire
your situation may be,

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:50.060 align:middle line:84%
no matter how addicted you are
to whatever substance or sex

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.790 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is, that it is
absolutely possible to overcome

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:54.590 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:57.800 align:middle line:84%
Because people who are
recovering from addiction

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.520 align:middle line:84%
are choosing every day, every
hour, every minute, right?

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean that
it's an easy choice.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:03.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: But I
don't believe we are

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:06.365 align:middle line:90%
powerless in the face of it.

00:21:06.365 --> 00:21:07.490 align:middle line:90%
So I just want to say that.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:08.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.680 align:middle line:90%
I think that's powerful.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And also, you said
in your book we're

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.500 align:middle line:84%
all addicts of some
kind or another.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.583 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: I believe that.

00:21:13.583 --> 00:21:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everybody's got
an addiction to something.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: The phone has
shown me that without question

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:21.770 align:middle line:84%
that we're all
wired for addiction.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And the places it takes us, it
varies within us depending on--

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No matter what it
is, whether it's gambling,

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.560 align:middle line:84%
whether it's drugs, whether
it's food, whether it's sex.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Absolutely.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
sensitives tend to be

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:35.700 align:middle line:84%
the ones who become more
addicted to drugs and food,

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.530 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a
big deal among women.

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Women who are super
sensitive and empathic,

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:43.190 align:middle line:84%
it's very common to
have food addictions

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.320 align:middle line:84%
to try to get that
serotonin going

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.850 align:middle line:90%
and just kind of crush it all.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Absolutely, and
the way we numb with things.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.465 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it's,
for me, really important--

00:21:52.465 --> 00:21:53.840 align:middle line:84%
for me, what it
does is it allows

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.715 align:middle line:84%
me to be more compassionate,
more empathetic.

00:21:55.715 --> 00:21:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that
people in addiction

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:01.220 align:middle line:84%
get dismissed so easily
and stereotyped so easily

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.275 align:middle line:84%
and stigmatized so
easily, and we really,

00:22:04.275 --> 00:22:06.720 align:middle line:84%
as a community and world,
need to move beyond that.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're
having conversations

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:11.030 align:middle line:84%
that are more empathetic
and more compassionate,

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.570 align:middle line:90%
and I think that's critical.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do.

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:14.390 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:15.848 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: So to
the New Age store.

00:22:15.848 --> 00:22:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so back
to the New Age store.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:21.950 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: That was a profound
change for me in my life

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:25.130 align:middle line:84%
because there was this
gorgeous book section with all

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:26.360 align:middle line:90%
of these metaphysical books.

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And this, for me, I
don't think I had ever

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.660 align:middle line:90%
heard the term enlightenment.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm at 24 at this time.

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.860 align:middle line:84%
I was working as a file
clerk in a law firm

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.850 align:middle line:84%
thinking I wanted
to be a lawyer,

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:38.623 align:middle line:84%
and everyone at the
law firm was miserable.

00:22:38.623 --> 00:22:40.790 align:middle line:84%
This was my first job out
of college, and I'm like--

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.433 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It deals in misery.

00:22:43.433 --> 00:22:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: --I'm not
compromising my happiness

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:46.150 align:middle line:90%
for a career.

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:48.050 align:middle line:84%
I made that
commitment at that age

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.580 align:middle line:90%
and mostly have stuck to it.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.360 align:middle line:84%
So my next job was at
this New Age gift shop,

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:56.630 align:middle line:84%
and everyone there was
like, their mission in life

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:58.670 align:middle line:84%
was to be more loving
and be more peaceful.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.550 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, this I like.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:04.370 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't seen that and
heard people talk this way

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:05.750 align:middle line:90%
and reference enlightenment.

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I
can get into this.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.260 align:middle line:90%
And I did get into it.

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.940 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I got into it hardcore.

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.810 align:middle line:84%
But it opened me up to
the prospect of love

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:18.800 align:middle line:84%
as a guiding force in my life
and that you don't necessarily

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.150 align:middle line:90%
need more than that.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:24.320 align:middle line:84%
What happens if you
decide to choose love

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.520 align:middle line:90%
as your guiding force?

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.680 align:middle line:84%
What other choices does that
choice inform in your life?

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.430 align:middle line:84%
How do you choose to
show up in your work,

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:34.800 align:middle line:84%
in your relationships in
everything that you're doing?

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.850 align:middle line:84%
So it really woke me up, and
in part because of the people

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:40.190 align:middle line:84%
I was around, the
conversations I was having,

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:43.310 align:middle line:90%
the books I was reading.

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:45.800 align:middle line:84%
It felt like-- you ever have
that feeling where you show up

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.750 align:middle line:84%
to a place that
you've never been

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:49.250 align:middle line:90%
and it feels like coming home?

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.820 align:middle line:84%
My first stay in Sedona
when I chose to move there,

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.060 align:middle line:84%
which happened through
some strange circumstances

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.890 align:middle line:84%
like everybody
else there, I felt

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:84%
like I just returned to my
tribe, my land, my being,

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:04.940 align:middle line:90%
spirits, home.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.130 align:middle line:84%
All of it was there
for me the first day.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:10.280 align:middle line:84%
First day, we were invited
to someone's birthday party

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.240 align:middle line:84%
in a grocery store line, and
everybody's flowing and dancing

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.340 align:middle line:84%
to beautiful kind
of New Agey music.

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:17.810 align:middle line:90%
And, oh yeah, I was in heaven.

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:19.210 align:middle line:84%
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:20.793 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: It's an
incredible feeling,

00:24:20.793 --> 00:24:23.390 align:middle line:84%
and that's what it felt like
walking into that store.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:25.937 align:middle line:84%
So it changed the
trajectory of my life.

00:24:25.937 --> 00:24:27.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it changed the
trajectory of my life

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:29.312 align:middle line:84%
because of everything
I've just said,

00:24:29.312 --> 00:24:31.430 align:middle line:84%
and it changed it
because it's also

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:33.908 align:middle line:84%
what got me involved in
a cult in the Bay Area.

00:24:33.908 --> 00:24:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, let's talk
about the cult for a minute.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.603 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: OK.

00:24:37.603 --> 00:24:39.270 align:middle line:84%
What do you want to
know about the cult?

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to know
what kind of cult it was

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:47.870 align:middle line:84%
and what they offered and how
they held sway and all of that.

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Because most people haven't
actually been in a cult.

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:54.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, although you
could arguably say

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.557 align:middle line:84%
certain religions are
a cult, of course.

00:24:56.557 --> 00:24:56.920 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Of course.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.720 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what
kind of cult was it?

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:01.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: I mean, there
was a guru basically,

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.470 align:middle line:84%
and it's a small-- it
doesn't have a name.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:08.120 align:middle line:84%
It's not like a recognized
cult. And I call it a cult

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.970 align:middle line:84%
because part of
the, I would say,

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:13.640 align:middle line:84%
the insidious nature
of cults, and this one

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.870 align:middle line:84%
is loss of free will, that
everything the guru says

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:18.980 align:middle line:90%
is right.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.130 align:middle line:84%
He is a puppet of God
by his own declaration.

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:25.550 align:middle line:84%
He is enlightened without
ego by his own declaration.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:29.540 align:middle line:84%
So if we're in resistance
to what he's saying,

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.580 align:middle line:84%
we're in resistance
to the Divine,

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.860 align:middle line:84%
and we're in resistance
to what is good for us.

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very intense
message to internalize.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was a smart
rational guy, and--

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you had
just gotten this feeling

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.170 align:middle line:84%
from your experiences
at the New Age

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:49.680 align:middle line:84%
shop of this drive toward
love, toward enlightenment.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.480 align:middle line:90%
So you were open.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Open.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And all of my friends at the
New Age shop were his disciples.

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:56.840 align:middle line:84%
They were all part
of this community.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.370 align:middle line:90%
I was really open.

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And I also, when I
reflect on it now

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:05.780 align:middle line:84%
through an even clearer lens, I
see that to have a man 16 years

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.690 align:middle line:84%
my senior giving me
attention and giving me

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:10.250 align:middle line:90%
love, which I never got--

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:11.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Father.

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: --from this
beautiful father figure.

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.430 align:middle line:90%
And he has a lot of love.

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:18.470 align:middle line:84%
There was so much love
in this community.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:23.480 align:middle line:84%
I was a part of it for 13 years
because it was immersed in love

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.730 align:middle line:84%
and talking about unconditional
love and unconditional

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:26.570 align:middle line:90%
friendship.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:28.160 align:middle line:90%
And there's a darker side.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.980 align:middle line:84%
There's an unwillingness
in my former teacher

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:34.290 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge his humanity
within the context of who

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:35.090 align:middle line:90%
he is.

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Yes, he's loving, and
also he's got a big ego.

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And his ego was directing
a lot of the decisions,

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:45.050 align:middle line:84%
and there was a lot
of cruel behavior,

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:47.193 align:middle line:84%
manipulative behavior,
ugly behavior.

00:26:47.193 --> 00:26:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Demanding
fealty and so forth?

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:49.735 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: All of it.

00:26:49.735 --> 00:26:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And I would always make excuses
for it, and the excuse I made

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:56.090 align:middle line:84%
was, I am not
enlightened I don't know

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:57.380 align:middle line:90%
what enlightenment looks like.

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, I detest
cults, gurus, et cetera,

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.290 align:middle line:90%
the notion of it.

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Not to say there aren't some
lovely gurus in the world.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure there are.

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:12.345 align:middle line:84%
But to give your power
away is a whole other--

00:27:12.345 --> 00:27:16.280 align:middle line:84%
that's a place I've never been
able to go in my own being

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.800 align:middle line:84%
because of exactly what
you're talking about.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.630 align:middle line:84%
You bought that
because you bought

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:23.752 align:middle line:84%
into his story of being
a self-proclaimed guru.

00:27:23.752 --> 00:27:25.460 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: I believed
he was enlightened.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And I believed he
was enlightened,

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:30.050 align:middle line:84%
and there was nothing
at that time in my life

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:32.540 align:middle line:84%
that became more important to
me than becoming enlightened.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:33.650 align:middle line:90%
I was obsessed with it.

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:36.260 align:middle line:84%
All I wanted to do was
be this fully realized

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.030 align:middle line:84%
enlightened human being, and
I'm like, he's my ticket.

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:41.780 align:middle line:84%
That's how people are
taken advantage of.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Absolutely,
absolutely.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.138 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
exactly that desire.

00:27:44.138 --> 00:27:45.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's a clean pure desire.

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Yeah.

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And one of the great gifts
of leaving that community

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.690 align:middle line:84%
was also leaving my
obsession with enlightenment

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:55.830 align:middle line:84%
because it created so
much pain in my life.

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:58.640 align:middle line:84%
I was constantly judging
myself against the

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:01.340 align:middle line:84%
what I imagined the enlightened
version of myself to be.

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that I
discovered, Regina,

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:07.850 align:middle line:84%
was that everything I
was choosing in my life

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:11.210 align:middle line:84%
for enlightenment, which was
to be as loving as possible,

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:13.950 align:middle line:84%
as forgiving as possible, as
compassionate as possible,

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:17.600 align:middle line:84%
all of these things I was still
choosing in my life having

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.510 align:middle line:84%
nothing to do with enlightenment
because I just recognize

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:23.060 align:middle line:84%
that when you're loving and
forgiving and compassionate,

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:26.330 align:middle line:84%
you're always serving yourself
in the world most beautifully.

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:29.030 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't have to be with
an end goal of enlightenment

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:29.830 align:middle line:90%
in mind.

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:32.030 align:middle line:10%
So I didn't change
any of my behaviors,

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:37.370 align:middle line:10%
but I removed this thing to
aim for and to feel less than

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:38.750 align:middle line:10%
because I wasn't.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.040 align:middle line:90%
And that was a huge gift.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Congratulations,
you did the journey.

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Yeah.

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:44.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was wild.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a path of
real enlightenment, yourself,

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.480 align:middle line:90%
I mean you.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:51.668 align:middle line:90%
And it's a lifetime journey.

00:28:51.668 --> 00:28:53.210 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
a handful of people

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:55.790 align:middle line:84%
probably on the planet who are
fully realized and blissed out

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and don't struggle with
the things that most of us

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:01.860 align:middle line:84%
struggle with, with
ego and being human.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.130 align:middle line:90%
But that's 0.0001%.

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:06.620 align:middle line:84%
The rest of us will be
working, I believe--

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:09.640 align:middle line:84%
if you choose to consciously--
your lifetime at it,

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and that's just the
nature of humanity.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And I've become more
and more OK with that.

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you had some
other moments of humility

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:21.050 align:middle line:90%
that were on the horizon.

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Yeah, sure.

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about your film.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: I knew
that was coming when

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:26.150 align:middle line:90%
you said moments of humility.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:26.790 align:middle line:90%
That was the obvious--

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do you
call it, "The Oogieloves"?

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: "The Oogieloves in
the Big Balloon Adventure."

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: "The Oogieloves in
the Big Balloon Adventure."

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.358 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what was
amazing to me is

00:29:33.358 --> 00:29:35.400 align:middle line:84%
that it opened in so many
theaters to begin with.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Over 2,000 theaters.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.505 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so--

00:29:37.505 --> 00:29:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: As an
independent film.

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:39.370 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't--

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So first of all, how
did you even become a script--

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: A writer?

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:43.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --writer and so forth?

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:46.802 align:middle line:84%
Where did that come
in the journey?

00:29:46.802 --> 00:29:48.260 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: The
first script I wrote

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.260 align:middle line:84%
was when I was with an
ex, and we were in a movie

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.320 align:middle line:84%
that I don't remember
the title of.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.880 align:middle line:84%
There still aren't,
but at the time,

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.820 align:middle line:84%
there weren't many
gay films out there.

00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:00.440 align:middle line:84%
This was an independent gay film
playing at the indie theater,

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.940 align:middle line:90%
and we went and saw it.

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:05.660 align:middle line:90%
And for me, it was awful.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.907 align:middle line:84%
Everything about it,
for me, was not--

00:30:07.907 --> 00:30:08.990 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't into the writing.

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:10.032 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't into the acting.

00:30:10.032 --> 00:30:11.730 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't into any aspect of it.

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at my partner
at the time, and I'm like,

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.630 align:middle line:84%
I am certain I can write
a better movie than this.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:19.130 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, then do it.

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:20.750 align:middle line:90%
And I wrote a script.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And in retrospect, I mean,
that script was awful too.

from all these other people--

>>STABILE: Oh, no,
no, I mean that's what

00:30:28.827 --> 00:30:29.660 align:middle line:90%
got me into writing.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:30.642 --> 00:30:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: That was
my very first script.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:33.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The first one.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:34.070 align:middle line:90%
So it was awful.

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Yeah, in
retrospect, but it got me--

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excited.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: That was the
first screenplay I wrote,

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like, oh, this
is kind of a fun thing.

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And then time passes,
and a friend of mine,

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.550 align:middle line:84%
who was the producer of
the film "The Oogieloves,"

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:49.410 align:middle line:84%
asked me if I wanted to
take a stab at writing it.

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:50.210 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:51.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now, why?

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.991 align:middle line:84%
Because they knew that you
had done some script writing--

00:30:52.991 --> 00:30:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Oh, I'd
written children's books.

>>REGINA: --and
children's books.

00:30:54.503 --> 00:30:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: I'd written
children's things for him.

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I noticed that, yeah.

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: He was involved in
a lot of different children's

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.170 align:middle line:84%
projects, so he was
familiar with my writing.

>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Yeah, Yeah, so
that's why he selected me.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I wrote the script
for this film called--

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:09.566 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: "Oogieloves in
the Big Balloon Adventure."

>>STABILE: "Big
Balloon Adventure,"

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:12.410 align:middle line:84%
which was targeted
at 3- to 5-year-olds.

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:16.670 align:middle line:84%
It was for preschoolers, which
the producer had a lot of--

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:19.317 align:middle line:84%
he brought the Teletubbies
from the UK to the States.

>>REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:21.320 align:middle line:90%
So he had some clout.

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.070 align:middle line:84%
He knew his way
around the industry.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Yeah, he knew
his way around the industry

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:24.310 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And he had a huge success
managing the Teletubbies

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:29.760 align:middle line:84%
obviously because that
was a huge project here.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.570 align:middle line:84%
So we put this film
together, and it still

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:37.400 align:middle line:84%
holds the record for the
lowest grossing wide release

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.340 align:middle line:90%
film in history.

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:41.450 align:middle line:84%
It's the biggest flop of all
time, and I'm the writer.

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And I can laugh about
it now, but I was not

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:44.840 align:middle line:90%
laughing when it happened.

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:48.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was a roller
coaster experience

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:51.320 align:middle line:84%
of actually writing something
that was turned into a film

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.200 align:middle line:90%
was huge.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And then actually having that
film get released in theaters,

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.572 align:middle line:84%
all of the stuff was beyond
kind of my wildest expectations.

00:31:58.572 --> 00:32:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh yeah, 2,000
theaters, that's huge.

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: It's huge.

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:03.950 align:middle line:90%
And then having it crash.

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:05.225 align:middle line:90%
And you know right away.

00:32:05.225 --> 00:32:07.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know on the
Friday it's released.

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:08.120 align:middle line:84%
I think it was
actually Wednesday

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.440 align:middle line:90%
because it was a Labor Day.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:12.742 align:middle line:84%
We knew day one
that it was a bomb.

bring your book here

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.530 align:middle line:84%

of the better ones.

>>STABILE: Akin to the
end of the world, I think,

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.610 align:middle line:90%
was another one.

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:36.150 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they ravaged the film.

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:36.950 align:middle line:90%
It was awful.

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:37.940 align:middle line:90%
And that was a really--

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:40.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, creatively
speaking, certainly--

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:43.850 align:middle line:84%
a traumatic thing to go
through and humiliating.

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And as a writer, you're
only one aspect obviously

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:46.651 align:middle line:90%
of the whole experience.

00:32:46.651 --> 00:32:47.818 align:middle line:90%

Your partner, the
producer in this,

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:52.410 align:middle line:90%
didn't he see this coming?

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:55.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, were you guys blind
to how it might be received?

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.580 align:middle line:90%
Or how did this happen?

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: I don't think so
because there was a tour done.

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:04.760 align:middle line:84%
We did a mommy blogger tour
before the film came out.

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And the film, for me,
the production quality

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:10.430 align:middle line:84%
looked more-- it
looked like Barney.

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:12.140 align:middle line:84%
There were these giant
puppet characters

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.360 align:middle line:84%
interacting with humans,
and it was very weird.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.235 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:33:15.235 --> 00:33:17.895 align:middle line:90%
Like PBS, like Teletubbies type.

00:33:17.895 --> 00:33:20.270 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I think it
looked like something you

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:22.130 align:middle line:90%
would see on PBS, on TV.

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.620 align:middle line:84%
That he got it into theaters,
I was very surprised

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:25.880 align:middle line:90%
and excited and astounded.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.960 align:middle line:84%
But we did this mommy blogger
tour leading up to the release.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.550 align:middle line:90%
And do you know what mommy--

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying that like you might
know what that is, but it's--

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not really.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.840 align:middle line:84%
I assume it's appealing
to the mothers.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Yeah, there's
this whole world of bloggers

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:40.342 align:middle line:84%
that are moms,
and so they're all

00:33:40.342 --> 00:33:42.050 align:middle line:84%
sharing all their
information and they're

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:43.460 align:middle line:90%
recommending products.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:45.590 align:middle line:84%
So we went to maybe
eight or nine cities.

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
mommy influencers.

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:48.548 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Mommy
influencers, yeah,

00:33:48.548 --> 00:33:50.030 align:middle line:90%
before that term was around.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And so we went to
a bunch of cities,

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.690 align:middle line:84%
and we screened it for
these mommy influencers.

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And the coolest part
of the whole movie,

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.490 align:middle line:84%
which was this
producer's idea and which

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:01.960 align:middle line:84%
was the most
exciting aspect, was

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.690 align:middle line:84%
he wanted to make a "Rocky
Horror" film for kids

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:08.320 align:middle line:84%
with the element of the kids
interacting with the movie.

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.649 align:middle line:90%
So there were all these songs.

00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:10.449 align:middle line:90%
It's a musical.

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:12.324 align:middle line:84%
There were all these
songs and dance numbers,

00:34:12.324 --> 00:34:14.409 align:middle line:84%
and there's this queue of
these butterflies going

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:16.284 align:middle line:84%
through the screen where
the kids are invited

00:34:16.284 --> 00:34:18.280 align:middle line:84%
to get out of their
seats and dance

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.020 align:middle line:84%
and move along with
the characters.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:20.989 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which sounds
really delightful.

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:22.822 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Which hadn't
been done in movies.

00:34:22.822 --> 00:34:23.800 align:middle line:90%
And it was.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.659 align:middle line:84%
And so we're on this
mommy blogger tour,

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:28.040 align:middle line:84%
and I'm seeing all these
kids getting up and having

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:28.840 align:middle line:90%
so much fun.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, maybe I'm
wrong about this movie.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Because I was kind of like, I
don't know that this is really

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:35.440 align:middle line:90%
going to resonate.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.889 align:middle line:84%
But these kids are enjoying
it, and it's for kids.

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And then it opened,
and it just bombed.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.710 align:middle line:84%
So I think we all had this
excitement like, oh, the kids

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.150 align:middle line:90%
are going to be into it.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.720 align:middle line:84%
But in retrospect
with the writing--

00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:49.179 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But kids
can't drive themselves

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:49.900 align:middle line:90%
to the movie theater.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: No.

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:51.760 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't--

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:52.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have to get
through the gatekeepers,

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:53.469 align:middle line:90%
the parents.

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: There are
a million things that

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:55.730 align:middle line:84%
could have been
done differently,

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:57.377 align:middle line:84%
and the main one,
I think, was really

00:34:57.377 --> 00:34:58.960 align:middle line:84%
to appeal to parents
as well, which is

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.580 align:middle line:90%
what animated films have to do.

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which at home
on your television works.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.526 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: You don't need
the parents at home--

00:35:04.526 --> 00:35:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't
need the parents.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.835 align:middle line:90%
But to go to the movie theater.

00:35:06.835 --> 00:35:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Absolutely.

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:08.908 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
they're offering

00:35:08.908 --> 00:35:10.420 align:middle line:90%
their input, their feedback.

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: And we
didn't have the parents.

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:14.950 align:middle line:84%
I had a funny conversation
with a friend of mine

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:18.670 align:middle line:84%
who gathered some
writers together

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.830 align:middle line:84%
for this online
conference thing,

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:23.000 align:middle line:84%
and he was
interviewing me for it.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.063 align:middle line:84%
And after we interviewed,
he called me later

00:35:25.063 --> 00:35:26.980 align:middle line:84%
because we were talking
about the "Oogieloves"

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:28.120 align:middle line:90%
and laughing about it.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And he called me, and
he said he was talking

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:31.720 align:middle line:90%
with his 22-year-old son.

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And he said, when
my son found out,

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:38.620 align:middle line:84%
he's like, you know the
writer of the "Oogieloves"?

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.232 align:middle line:90%
Because a lot of stoners would--

00:35:41.232 --> 00:35:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's like
a little cult hit.

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: It's a little
cult thing for pot smokers--

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: --because it's so
twisted and bizarre, yeah.

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
you wrote in the book--

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.940 align:middle line:84%
this is how bad it
was-- you didn't even

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:55.120 align:middle line:84%
rise to the level of winning
the 33rd Annual Raspberry

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Award, which is for
the worst films.

00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Right.

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:57.730 align:middle line:90%
It was nominated.

00:35:57.730 --> 00:35:59.538 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but you
didn't even win that.

00:35:59.538 --> 00:36:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: I couldn't
even win that, yeah.

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You came in
second to "Twilight Sage--

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:04.728 align:middle line:90%
Breaking Down Part Two."

00:36:04.728 --> 00:36:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Oh, that
must be newer research.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:07.270 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even know that.

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah,
I was looking at it.

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: I just
know we didn't win.

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.836 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah, I
did some research, yeah.

00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:12.378 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: We came
in second, though.

00:36:12.378 --> 00:36:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But so tell
me what this did to you

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.175 align:middle line:90%
kind of on an egoic level.

00:36:18.175 --> 00:36:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: As hard
experiences often are,

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.940 align:middle line:84%
it was a really
beautiful experience.

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:25.993 align:middle line:84%
One, because what it did
for me is it showed me

00:36:25.993 --> 00:36:27.160 align:middle line:90%
I've had a profound failure.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.740 align:middle line:84%
I was depressed for
maybe a couple of weeks,

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.780 align:middle line:84%
and then I started
writing again.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:34.840 align:middle line:84%
It was like, OK, is this going
to keep you from writing?

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.890 align:middle line:90%
This is awful.

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:37.931 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of
financial interest,

00:36:37.931 --> 00:36:40.014 align:middle line:84%
meaning I thought it was
going to be a ticket to--

00:36:40.014 --> 00:36:41.139 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Change your life.

00:36:41.139 --> 00:36:43.295 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Yeah, and it
did in different ways.

00:36:43.295 --> 00:36:44.920 align:middle line:84%
So there were a lot
of disappointments,

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:47.510 align:middle line:84%
but it's also like, OK, what
are you going to do about it?

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.552 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to let this
stop you from creating?

00:36:49.552 --> 00:36:50.968 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to
let this stop you

00:36:50.968 --> 00:36:52.660 align:middle line:84%
from putting your
energy into the things

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.243 align:middle line:84%
that you want to put
your energy into?

00:36:54.243 --> 00:36:55.270 align:middle line:90%
No, of course not.

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:56.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that was
really important, I think.

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:57.220 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: It's huge.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Huge for you
because a lot of people

00:36:58.840 --> 00:36:59.770 align:middle line:90%
don't get past that.

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:01.145 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: No,
you can just stop.

00:37:01.145 --> 00:37:02.397 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people may have.

00:37:02.397 --> 00:37:04.480 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing I
realized, what I write about

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.300 align:middle line:84%
in the chapter, is it's
like, how do you really

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:11.020 align:middle line:84%
define success, and how do
you really define failure?

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Writing a script that ultimately
is the biggest bomb of all time

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:17.980 align:middle line:84%
means so little to
me compared to how

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:20.000 align:middle line:84%
am I showing up as a
loving compassionate person

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:20.800 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.540 align:middle line:90%
How am I impacting people?

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:23.650 align:middle line:90%
How am I affecting people?

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:25.660 align:middle line:84%
How am I resonating
with other people?

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.550 align:middle line:84%
That's what means the
most to me in my life.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:30.250 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm giving my
energy over to the most,

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:34.090 align:middle line:84%
and that's ultimately how
I define success in my life

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:36.738 align:middle line:84%
is based on how forgiving I am,
how compassionate, how loving.

00:37:36.738 --> 00:37:38.155 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who you
are as a person.

00:37:38.155 --> 00:37:39.488 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Who I am as a person.

00:37:39.488 --> 00:37:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And I say that, and when
"Big Love" came out,

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:44.560 align:middle line:84%
all the same ego
stories came through.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:48.010 align:middle line:84%
So it is true what I'm
saying that I define success

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.870 align:middle line:84%
by how loving and what
kind of person I am.

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:52.343 align:middle line:84%
And then I write another
book, and it's like,

00:37:52.343 --> 00:37:53.510 align:middle line:90%
are people going to like it?

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:54.635 align:middle line:90%
Are people going to buy it?

00:37:54.635 --> 00:37:57.862 align:middle line:84%
All those ego stories come
out because we are everything.

00:37:57.862 --> 00:37:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm learning
in my life is

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.653 align:middle line:90%
I can hold space for everything.

00:38:00.653 --> 00:38:02.440 align:middle line:84%
I can hold space
for the ego story

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.000 align:middle line:84%
without judging myself
for it because we're human

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.550 align:middle line:84%
and we all have
that BS going on.

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And I can hold space
for the part of me

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:13.480 align:middle line:84%
that is so not about that, that
recognizes love and compassion

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.130 align:middle line:90%
and kindness is what matters.

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And keep showing up
in your creativity,

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:19.040 align:middle line:84%
keep doing what you
feel called to do.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And as much as possible,
let go of the outcome

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.630 align:middle line:84%
because we have no
control over the outcome.

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So often,
especially if you're in--

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:28.940 align:middle line:84%
in general in the
world, everywhere now,

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.330 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter what
you thought was stable.

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:33.290 align:middle line:90%
It's not stable anymore.

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And so you might as
well be yourself.

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm reflecting back on a
situation when I was young,

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.580 align:middle line:90%
I was on top of the world.

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:43.570 align:middle line:84%
I was working for NBC , flying
first class to New York,

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:46.750 align:middle line:84%
and having a blast doing
weekend sports, making money.

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And then because it was very
inconvenient and expensive

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.960 align:middle line:84%
to fly me in from Lake
Tahoe where I lived--

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.240 align:middle line:90%
because I like skiing--

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.625 align:middle line:90%
they told me I had an ultimatum.

00:38:58.625 --> 00:39:00.500 align:middle line:84%
They said, you have to
move to New York City.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:01.542 align:middle line:90%
We can't keep doing this.

00:39:01.542 --> 00:39:05.070 align:middle line:84%
It takes a day to get you here
and to the stories and such.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, but
I really like skiing.

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:09.650 align:middle line:84%
I really like to
ski on my days off.

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And basically, I got notice
from my attorney I was fired,

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.550 align:middle line:90%
and so that was immediately.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:17.720 align:middle line:90%
So now I have no income, right?

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.615 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm working at a little
jean shop in Tahoe City--

00:39:20.615 --> 00:39:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: That's humbling.

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --called
Finding Funky.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
moment, and I experienced

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.720 align:middle line:84%
what you experienced in
that there was this moment--

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:30.970 align:middle line:90%
I was fine doing it.

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:33.000 align:middle line:90%
It was fine.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.360 align:middle line:84%
This man came in,
and he had a ponch.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And we did free alterations,
and I was on my knees

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and pinning up his pants
to the right length.

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And he looked down,
and this light went on.

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:45.050 align:middle line:90%
He said, hold on a minute.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Aren't you that NBC
girl with Bryant Gumbel?

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:51.128 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, that was
me then, this is me now.

00:39:51.128 --> 00:39:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: How wonderful.

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:54.087 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I realized
I wasn't embarrassed,

00:39:54.087 --> 00:39:57.020 align:middle line:84%
and that was a huge
defining moment in my life

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:59.100 align:middle line:90%
to realize I'm not that.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm me.

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:02.220 align:middle line:84%
No matter what I'm
doing, I'm still me.

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't destroy me,
and I didn't quit media.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:06.950 align:middle line:84%
I just went on to do
lots of other things.

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:09.080 align:middle line:84%
But it was just a
comedown in that moment.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And he felt so
embarrassed for me.

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:14.312 align:middle line:84%
And I've had other such
situations in later years

00:40:14.312 --> 00:40:15.770 align:middle line:84%
happen where people
were just like,

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:18.187 align:middle line:84%
oh my God, if that happened
to her, it could happen to me.

00:40:18.187 --> 00:40:19.730 align:middle line:90%
Other people in the media.

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:22.290 align:middle line:90%
No, that's not who we are.

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:23.592 align:middle line:90%
That's just your calling card--

00:40:23.592 --> 00:40:23.975 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: It's
just what you're--

00:40:23.975 --> 00:40:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Your job.

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: --doing
in that moment.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.050 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Exactly.

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:30.087 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and so that
whole thing about shame.

00:40:30.087 --> 00:40:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And that really brings us to
the subject of shame, which

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:33.725 align:middle line:90%
you talk about quite a bit.

00:40:33.725 --> 00:40:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And also, we're going
to get into the subject

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.953 align:middle line:84%
of forgiveness,
including the person that

00:40:38.953 --> 00:40:39.995 align:middle line:90%
did this to your parents.

00:40:39.995 --> 00:40:41.870 align:middle line:90%
But first, let's go to shame.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of people
would feel shame

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:46.028 align:middle line:84%
after having a
real bust like that

00:40:46.028 --> 00:40:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and carry the shame
around with them,

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:51.050 align:middle line:84%
which is let's talk about the
notion and the nature of shame

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:53.020 align:middle line:84%
and what it does
to the human being.

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: It's so dark,
it's so insidious, shame.

00:40:56.270 --> 00:41:00.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for me, shame
is contrary to guilt.

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:02.690 align:middle line:84%
I think people mix
those things up often.

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And for me, if I'm feeling
guilty about something,

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:08.150 align:middle line:84%
it's about an action
that I've taken.

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.990 align:middle line:90%
I was a real jerk.

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:11.180 align:middle line:84%
I did something, and
I'm having guilt.

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And shame is more
insidious because it's

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.080 align:middle line:90%
saying who you are.

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:17.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not about what you've
done, it's that who you are

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:17.140 align:middle line:90%
is flawed.

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who you
are is flawed, yes.

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:19.255 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Is flawed.

00:41:19.255 --> 00:41:20.790 align:middle line:90%
You are not enough as you are.

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:22.760 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing you can
do that will get you

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:24.410 align:middle line:90%
to a place of being enough.

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's a really
debilitating message

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:32.800 align:middle line:84%
that we all have to
some degree or have had.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, some of us
have transcended it,

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:37.062 align:middle line:84%
but I still see shame
creeping in in different areas

00:41:37.062 --> 00:41:38.180 align:middle line:90%
of my life.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It can be shame
around having someone fire you,

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:44.510 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Absolutely.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like, what about me?

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:47.660 align:middle line:84%
You can feel like I'm not
good and I'm not worthy.

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Absolutely.

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:51.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Shame around body.

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:52.677 align:middle line:90%
How many people, men and women--

00:41:52.677 --> 00:41:53.715 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Everyone
has body shame.

00:41:53.715 --> 00:41:54.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --have body shame.

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.625 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Absolutely.

00:41:55.625 --> 00:41:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The vehicle
that they're showing up

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:02.810 align:middle line:84%
in is insufficient and something
you hide from the world

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:04.490 align:middle line:90%
because it's so shameful.

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And you think, wait a minute,
I have been out to hot springs

00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:11.570 align:middle line:84%
where there are clothing
optional or no clothing allowed

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:12.500 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.750 align:middle line:84%
You see every kind of
body under the sun.

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:15.170 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: That's so beautiful.

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And within
a moment or two,

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:20.930 align:middle line:84%
you don't really notice the
person's shape and size and all

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:22.170 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:24.520 align:middle line:84%
But what lengths
people go through--

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.270 align:middle line:84%
because you talk about
this in your book--

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:27.565 align:middle line:90%
to hide their own bodies.

00:42:27.565 --> 00:42:28.440 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Oh my God.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You went
through body shaming.

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.520 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Losing
my hair at a young--

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.660 align:middle line:90%
I lost my hair early.

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:33.395 align:middle line:90%
And I knew it was coming--

00:42:33.395 --> 00:42:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank God bald is
cool because you look great.

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:36.905 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Well, thank you.

00:42:36.905 --> 00:42:38.960 align:middle line:84%
But in college, it
was really traumatic.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.500 align:middle line:84%
I was never without
a baseball cap

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.500 align:middle line:84%
on my head for the first
three years of college.

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.140 align:middle line:84%
No one saw the top of my head
because I was going bald.

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And the energy that went
into that, the energy,

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:50.899 align:middle line:84%
it's insane when we
consider the energy

00:42:50.899 --> 00:42:52.107 align:middle line:90%
we put into hiding ourselves.

00:42:52.107 --> 00:42:53.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hiding ourselves.

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:54.345 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: It's exhausting.

00:42:54.345 --> 00:42:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is
it naturally doesn't

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:01.218 align:middle line:84%
allow us to show up with energy
for other things in our lives

00:43:01.218 --> 00:43:02.510 align:middle line:90%
that can actually be rewarding.

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:04.177 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't
realize that, though.

00:43:04.177 --> 00:43:06.620 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what this
insidious program running

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:07.953 align:middle line:90%
in the background is doing.

00:43:07.953 --> 00:43:08.870 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Absolutely.

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:10.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my sexuality
has been, by far,

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:11.750 align:middle line:90%
my biggest shame in my life--

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and I was
going to get to that too.

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: --and coming
to terms with being gay.

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:17.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is a shame
that's really heavy.

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And what I've come to learn
about shame, what I've

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:24.230 align:middle line:84%
come to discover about
it, is the only way

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:29.000 align:middle line:84%
to transcend it is to
announce it, is to speak it.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.685 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't
announce it to the world,

00:43:31.685 --> 00:43:33.290 align:middle line:90%
find someone you can confide in.

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens
naturally when

00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:38.060 align:middle line:84%
we speak our shame to another
person, someone we can trust,

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:41.660 align:middle line:84%
someone who is able to
receive it without judging us,

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:43.740 align:middle line:90%
it automatically starts to lift.

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:46.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: And we also
see that we're not alone.

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:50.330 align:middle line:84%
I've done a lot of, for
the past nine years maybe,

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:53.570 align:middle line:84%
been on social media a lot
and sharing a lot of myself

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:54.370 align:middle line:90%
through writing.

00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And any time I share the
more vulnerable elements,

00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:00.880 align:middle line:84%
the elements I feel shame
about or traumas or fears

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.820 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, they're always
the posts that get the most

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:05.140 align:middle line:90%
response and engagement.

00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And the engagement
is almost always

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:10.300 align:middle line:84%
of the variety of
"me too" and thank

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:11.620 align:middle line:90%
you so much for sharing this.

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:13.120 align:middle line:84%
I want you to know
you're not alone,

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and thank you for letting
me know I'm not alone.

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of the
most profound deepest gifts

00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:20.410 align:middle line:84%
that come when we have
the courage to share

00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:21.610 align:middle line:90%
our shame with the world.

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:23.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like rolling out
a red carpet for people

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:27.760 align:middle line:84%
to see you are not alone in
what you are experiencing.

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we heal.

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:30.620 align:middle line:90%
That's how we grow.

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:31.537 align:middle line:90%
That's how we connect.

00:44:31.537 --> 00:44:34.360 align:middle line:84%
That's how we deepen our empathy
and compassion for one another.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:36.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at the
#MeToo movement.

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Look at what happened
when a handful of women

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.390 align:middle line:84%
were willing to
stand in their shame

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and finally announce
it to the world.

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Walls came down
around the world.

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
that's a big one

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:48.670 align:middle line:84%
because that's happening
on subtle levels

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:50.470 align:middle line:90%
all the time with women.

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:52.150 align:middle line:90%
It always has historically.

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:54.040 align:middle line:84%
You need to do
what you have to do

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:57.820 align:middle line:84%
to get where you need to go to
keep a position of stability

00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:59.110 align:middle line:90%
or security in your life.

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:02.260 align:middle line:84%
It happens in situations,
even marriages

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:03.700 align:middle line:90%
that's happening all the time.

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:05.800 align:middle line:90%
But that was so flagrant.

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And because it's Hollywood and
has bigger, more glitzy story

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:14.410 align:middle line:84%
around it, I'm
hoping that it helped

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:18.307 align:middle line:84%
women start to understand where
we've all sold ourselves out.

00:45:18.307 --> 00:45:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: I think it has.

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not just
that you're a victim.

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:23.920 align:middle line:84%
There is an element
and the shame

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:27.340 align:middle line:84%
comes in having agreed
to certain things

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:30.820 align:middle line:84%
in order to, say,
not lose their job.

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:32.710 align:middle line:84%
That's very deeply
part of being feminine.

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:34.270 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Yeah, yeah,
it's the whole story.

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the whole story.

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: I mean, and
if you're willing to be

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.950 align:middle line:84%
honest with yourself and really
make space for the whole story.

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:43.000 align:middle line:84%
But for me, the thing
I really encourage

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.090 align:middle line:84%
people to do if they're
able is start sharing it.

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:47.420 align:middle line:90%
And we live at a time--

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:49.120 align:middle line:84%
and if you're not
ready to share it,

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.770 align:middle line:84%
start reading books
of people who have.

00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Because I guarantee whatever
shame you're experiencing--

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:55.660 align:middle line:90%
not you, the universal you--

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:58.390 align:middle line:84%
there are any number of
people who are dealing

00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:00.220 align:middle line:90%
with that exact same shame.

00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:01.960 align:middle line:90%
Our shame tells us we're alone.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Even as a gay kid knowing that
I'm not the only gay person

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:08.830 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, my shame wanted
me to believe I was alone

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:12.670 align:middle line:84%
in it, that there was something
about my sexuality in nature

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:16.360 align:middle line:84%
that was singular and it was
darker and more sinful than

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:17.160 align:middle line:90%
other people's.

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.790 align:middle line:90%
That's the message of shame.

00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:22.510 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not able to
speak your shame and share it,

00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:23.680 align:middle line:90%
read it.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Type your shame into
Facebook, and you'll

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:28.240 align:middle line:84%
see 50 pages that
are dedicated to it.

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is what can
help us get to a place

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:32.890 align:middle line:84%
where we feel ready because
we've seen enough people who

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:35.290 align:middle line:84%
are dealing with the
same types of situations

00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:36.140 align:middle line:90%
we're dealing with.

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And also, I just was
flashing on something

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:41.230 align:middle line:90%
when you were talking.

00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:43.780 align:middle line:84%
We have three or four
different channelers

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.870 align:middle line:84%
that appear regularly on this
show throughout the years

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:49.240 align:middle line:84%
because people love
them, and one of them

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:53.650 align:middle line:84%
said, the greatest sin, if
you have a sin of humanity,

00:46:53.650 --> 00:46:56.710 align:middle line:84%
is to carry shame
for themselves.

00:46:56.710 --> 00:47:00.040 align:middle line:84%
That's the darkest thing
we can do is carry shame.

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Yeah, you
can't be in your truth

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:03.500 align:middle line:90%
when you're in your shame.

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:04.540 align:middle line:90%
It's not possible.

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet at the same
time, when we go to the movies

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:11.140 align:middle line:84%
or we read books, the one
thing is our heart cracks open

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:14.170 align:middle line:84%
when a person reveals
their true vulnerability.

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:16.060 align:middle line:84%
That's when we start
feeling for each other.

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Absolutely.

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's when you really
want the person in the film

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:19.330 align:middle line:90%
to succeed.

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:20.540 align:middle line:90%
They've been through so much.

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:23.267 align:middle line:84%
They've had this horrific
experience or whatever

00:47:23.267 --> 00:47:24.100 align:middle line:90%
they've been hiding.

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And it should teach us
something for ourselves,

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.810 align:middle line:84%
but we don't seem to
take that away from it.

00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:33.045 align:middle line:90%
We still hide.

00:47:33.045 --> 00:47:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: I think
it's shifting.

00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:34.975 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Even though we know.

00:47:34.975 --> 00:47:37.288 align:middle line:84%
We can see that it breaks
our heart open when

00:47:37.288 --> 00:47:38.580 align:middle line:90%
someone else reveals something.

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Yeah, I do
believe it's shifting.

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:41.170 align:middle line:90%
It's slow.

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:41.665 align:middle line:90%
Evolution is so slow.

00:47:41.665 --> 00:47:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
think social media

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.598 align:middle line:84%
has done a good job of
that because it's so me,

00:47:44.598 --> 00:47:46.450 align:middle line:90%
me, for good or bad.

00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Yes, for sure.

00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:50.560 align:middle line:84%
But there are a lot of writers,
speakers, healers, artists

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:55.150 align:middle line:84%
who are more willing to
be in their vulnerability,

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:58.060 align:middle line:84%
to show like, hey, this
is what I'm going through.

00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:00.580 align:middle line:84%
This is what-- and it's
helping other people,

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:02.695 align:middle line:84%
I think, find the courage
to do the same thing.

00:48:02.695 --> 00:48:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I think so.

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: That's
the gift of it.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
the gift of forgiveness

00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:10.750 align:middle line:84%
and how that worked in your
life and how you ultimately

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:13.420 align:middle line:84%
had to contend with the person
that murdered your parents.

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Yeah, I mean,
forgiveness is, for me,

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:20.740 align:middle line:84%
one of the biggest gifts
that we can give ourselves,

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.590 align:middle line:90%
and is for me a mandate of love.

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:25.540 align:middle line:90%
Love is forgiveness.

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:28.510 align:middle line:84%
So I don't see anything
as unforgivable.

00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:31.870 align:middle line:84%
It's not how I live my
life or look at life.

00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's not to
say that I don't

00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:38.227 align:middle line:84%
see forgiveness is the toughest
mandate of love for most of us.

00:48:38.227 --> 00:48:40.060 align:middle line:84%
But with the man who
killed my parents, what

00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:43.330 align:middle line:84%
I started to notice about
myself was that for years

00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:45.460 align:middle line:90%
I was living in rage and hatred.

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:47.980 align:middle line:84%
As a teenager, I was never
thinking about forgiveness

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:49.000 align:middle line:90%
after that.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.690 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't even heard
coming into my mind.

00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:53.700 align:middle line:84%
But in my 20s when I
got the job at the store

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.158 align:middle line:84%
and I'm reading
more of these books

00:48:55.158 --> 00:48:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and I'm starting to feel
how love is operating

00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:00.060 align:middle line:84%
in my being, what
I started to notice

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:01.710 align:middle line:84%
is that when I
would think of him,

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:05.185 align:middle line:84%
I'd be overcome with hatred
and rage and vengeful thoughts

00:49:05.185 --> 00:49:06.810 align:middle line:84%
and violent thoughts,
wanting him dead.

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:07.685 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:49:07.685 --> 00:49:11.040 align:middle line:84%
Like thinking all these horrors,
which made perfect sense.

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:14.160 align:middle line:84%
But then I started to
really pay attention

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:17.490 align:middle line:84%
to how I was feeling when I
was having these thoughts.

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:20.920 align:middle line:84%
How were those thoughts
impacting me emotionally,

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:21.720 align:middle line:90%
physically?

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.095 align:middle line:84%
Feeling tight in my chest,
feeling nervous in my stomach,

00:49:24.095 --> 00:49:26.190 align:middle line:84%
feeling like this when
we're angry and rageful.

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:27.482 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Poisoning your being.

00:49:27.482 --> 00:49:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Poisoning
my being, absolutely.

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And what I came to believe was
that I need to forgive him.

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:35.650 align:middle line:84%
I need to figure out
a way to forgive him.

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:39.840 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be my ticket to
freedom from this experience.

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you learn about
him, anything about him?

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Not specifics,
other than knowing--

00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:48.780 align:middle line:84%
because he was someone that knew
my-- he came into the store.

00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:54.120 align:middle line:84%
What I knew about him for
sure was that he was poor.

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:57.090 align:middle line:84%
What I felt like I
could judge about him

00:49:57.090 --> 00:49:59.890 align:middle line:90%
was that he was angry.

00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:00.840 align:middle line:90%
He felt lost.

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.850 align:middle line:90%
He felt confused.

00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Because nobody
would murder people

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:08.340 align:middle line:84%
if they weren't feeling
rage and confusion

00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:10.270 align:middle line:84%
and all of these
different things.

00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And so what I thought was, how
could I relate to this man?

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:15.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, I feel lost.

00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:17.100 align:middle line:90%
I feel angry.

00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:18.550 align:middle line:90%
I feel confused.

00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:19.980 align:middle line:84%
I feel all of
these things that I

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:23.550 align:middle line:84%
imagine this other
man feels that led

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:25.547 align:middle line:90%
him to do this horrible thing.

00:50:25.547 --> 00:50:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And even the violence,
which I was telling myself,

00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:29.850 align:middle line:84%
well, I could never
relate to killing people,

00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:32.370 align:middle line:84%
I'd imagine killing
him in my head

00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:34.130 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:37.560 align:middle line:84%
So even the violence I
could relate to in my being.

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly when I
was connecting with him

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:44.700 align:middle line:84%
from those places, he wasn't
just a murderer, right?

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:46.030 align:middle line:90%
He's another human being.

00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:50.730 align:middle line:84%
He's another brother of mine on
this planet who is struggling.

00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's not to in any
way condone the choice

00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:57.030 align:middle line:84%
he ultimately made, but
it's to understand him

00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:58.410 align:middle line:90%
beyond that choice.

00:50:58.410 --> 00:51:01.140 align:middle line:84%
It's to seek to understand
him, to empathize

00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:04.270 align:middle line:84%
with his experience as a
human being on this planet.

00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And it changed
everything for me.

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And what I started feeling
when I would think about him

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:11.160 align:middle line:90%
was love in my heart.

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately what I realized
was I have forgiven this man.

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And the gift of
forgiveness, for me,

00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:22.740 align:middle line:84%
was that it untethered me
to that experience of him

00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:25.260 align:middle line:90%
in this toxic hateful way.

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that I
don't feel the pain

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:31.530 align:middle line:84%
of the loss of my parents
even now, 30-plus years later.

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:32.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not that--

00:51:32.610 --> 00:51:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Has he been in
prison this whole time?

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.038 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: He's been in
prison this whole time.

00:51:36.038 --> 00:51:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that
the pain of that

00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:40.560 align:middle line:84%
is what I don't
experience still,

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.970 align:middle line:84%
but I feel none of
the hatred toward him

00:51:42.970 --> 00:51:44.220 align:middle line:90%
and haven't for decades.

00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:45.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Congratulations.

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: None of it.

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And that has been one of
the biggest gifts in my life

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:53.700 align:middle line:84%
honestly to be shown that I have
the capacity for forgiveness

00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:56.820 align:middle line:84%
on that level and that
forgiveness affords

00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:59.850 align:middle line:90%
us that kind of freedom.

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful job.

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.570 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:04.445 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Thank you.

00:52:04.445 --> 00:52:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now let's kind of
move into where we are today.

00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And really, that's just
admirable and beautiful.

00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:12.390 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: You get a star.

00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:13.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:14.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful.

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:17.280 align:middle line:84%
So now we're in a time
where the world has changed.

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:20.070 align:middle line:84%
The pandemic turned
the world upside down.

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:24.600 align:middle line:84%
It's left people
frustrated, confused, angry.

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:29.350 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of rage going on
out there for a lot of reasons.

00:52:29.350 --> 00:52:32.280 align:middle line:90%
And so in your way of--

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:35.280 align:middle line:84%
as you blog and so forth,
how are you addressing this

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:42.202 align:middle line:84%
with people who follow your
work, this darkness that they

00:52:42.202 --> 00:52:43.410 align:middle line:90%
feel they're contending with?

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's a huge percentage
of the population because

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:48.960 align:middle line:84%
of mass confusion, loss of
income, a lot of things.

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Yeah.

00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:53.470 align:middle line:84%
For the last month and a half,
I have not been on social media.

00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:57.870 align:middle line:84%
The first for over two
months, probably 2 and 1/2

00:52:57.870 --> 00:53:00.870 align:middle line:84%
months every day when
the pandemic started,

00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:05.430 align:middle line:84%
I was doing live videos
on Instagram and Facebook

00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:09.210 align:middle line:84%
because I felt like I could
show up and create a space that

00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:11.100 align:middle line:84%
was peaceful,
create a space that

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:13.770 align:middle line:84%
allowed people to express
their fears and their angers.

00:53:13.770 --> 00:53:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like a way to be
present with the communities

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.240 align:middle line:90%
that I've built there.

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:26.530 align:middle line:90%


00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:29.470 align:middle line:84%
When your producer first reached
out to me to be on the show,

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:34.150 align:middle line:84%
it was probably two months ago,
I was in a really dark space.

00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And I said yes only
because I trusted

00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:39.580 align:middle line:84%
that in two months' time I
wouldn't be in the same space

00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:39.910 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.982 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
you're an optimist.

00:53:39.982 --> 00:53:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: --that's
how life works.

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:45.610 align:middle line:84%
But I was in a dark
space because I

00:53:45.610 --> 00:53:52.570 align:middle line:84%
was feeling really overcome by
the capacity for human beings

00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:54.970 align:middle line:90%
to be really ugly and violent.

00:53:54.970 --> 00:53:57.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm a very sensitive person,
as you are and as many of us

00:53:57.850 --> 00:53:59.000 align:middle line:90%
are in the world.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And when I get
into darkness now,

00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:05.320 align:middle line:84%
it's thankfully not
because of who I am.

00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:10.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not that I don't
see the parts in me

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:12.520 align:middle line:84%
that I want to work
on and want to grow,

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:14.440 align:middle line:90%
but I really love who I am.

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:17.770 align:middle line:84%
I really offer myself love
even when I'm judging myself.

00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:19.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm really good at that.

00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:20.680 align:middle line:84%
When I get into
darkness now, it's

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:23.710 align:middle line:84%
because I look at a world
that is so violent and so

00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:27.010 align:middle line:90%
toxic and so unconscious.

00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And I see myself in
that too, the ways

00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:31.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm acting in that way.

00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:34.070 align:middle line:90%
And it overwhelms me at times.

00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And watching ourselves
go through this pandemic

00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:40.552 align:middle line:84%
and go through George Floyd
and everything around racism

00:54:40.552 --> 00:54:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the
beauty that's coming

00:54:42.010 --> 00:54:44.740 align:middle line:84%
from that and the awakening
that's coming from that and how

00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:46.670 align:middle line:84%
powerful and necessary
and important that is--

00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:47.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Profound.

00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: --profound.

00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And also seeing
the ugliness that

00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:55.520 align:middle line:90%
is being exacerbated by it.

00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:57.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
else to say other

00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:02.290 align:middle line:84%
than I have learned the most
by being with what is happening

00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:05.740 align:middle line:84%
with me in the most honest
way possible and looking

00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:07.540 align:middle line:90%
at my place within it.

00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:09.730 align:middle line:84%
What I know is that
if I focus on how

00:55:09.730 --> 00:55:14.410 align:middle line:84%
dark and violent this world
can be, that doesn't serve me.

00:55:14.410 --> 00:55:17.800 align:middle line:84%
If I focus on how dark
and violent I can be

00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:20.410 align:middle line:84%
and seek to heal that and
put energy into healing that

00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:23.680 align:middle line:84%
and put energy into showing
up with more love and more

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:26.590 align:middle line:84%
compassion and being an
example of what I want to see

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:28.730 align:middle line:90%
in the world, that serves me.

00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:31.455 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I believe
ultimately serves the world.

00:55:31.455 --> 00:55:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So what I needed to do was
not focus as much on the news.

00:55:37.090 --> 00:55:41.845 align:middle line:84%
And what I was doing was just
feeding myself more information

00:55:41.845 --> 00:55:42.645 align:middle line:90%
that ultimately--

00:55:42.645 --> 00:55:43.687 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, it's toxic.

00:55:43.687 --> 00:55:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: It's so toxic, right?

00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:49.060 align:middle line:84%
We ultimately only
have power over how

00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:50.560 align:middle line:90%
we're choosing to show up.

00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:53.140 align:middle line:84%
So what kind of world
do you want to create?

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:55.060 align:middle line:84%
What kind of world
do you want to see?

00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:57.015 align:middle line:84%
And what are you
doing to create it?

00:55:57.015 --> 00:55:59.140 align:middle line:84%
There are going to be people
out there all the time

00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:02.560 align:middle line:84%
who are saying things
that are horrifying to you

00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:05.840 align:middle line:84%
and offensive to you and
unevolved and unconscious

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:06.640 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:10.720 align:middle line:84%
OK, if you're going to choose
to respond to those things,

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:12.520 align:middle line:90%
how are you choosing to respond?

00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:15.190 align:middle line:84%
Is it with empathy, or
are you dismissing them?

00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:16.190 align:middle line:90%
Are you belittling them?

00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:18.080 align:middle line:90%
Are you dehumanizing them?

00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:20.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
dehumanize even those

00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:22.690 align:middle line:90%
who seek to dehumanize me.

00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:24.490 align:middle line:84%
That is not the life
I want to be living.

00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:27.010 align:middle line:84%
That is not my
contribution to this world.

00:56:27.010 --> 00:56:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And it is very easy to get
sucked into the toxic nature

00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:31.660 align:middle line:90%
of hatred.

00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:32.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Very, very easy.

00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:33.790 align:middle line:90%
It's almost--

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:35.582 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It takes over
because it actually

00:56:35.582 --> 00:56:37.750 align:middle line:84%
becomes almost a chemical
response in the body

00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:38.570 align:middle line:90%
and in the brain.

00:56:38.570 --> 00:56:39.213 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:56:39.213 --> 00:56:39.324 align:middle line:90%
It's addictive.

00:56:39.324 --> 00:56:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
looking for satisfaction

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:40.930 align:middle line:90%
and it's addictive.

00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: It's absolutely
addictive, yeah.

00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:43.060 align:middle line:90%
It's almost--

00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:43.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not good.

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: --always harder
to make the choice of love.

00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:48.440 align:middle line:10%
But the choice of love
by empathy, compassion,

00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:51.888 align:middle line:10%
forgiveness, whatever, that's
all love in action for me.

00:56:51.888 --> 00:56:54.430 align:middle line:10%
That choice is always going to
benefit you and always benefit

00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:55.230 align:middle line:10%
others.

00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And not by ignoring
what's going on,

00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:01.600 align:middle line:84%
not by pretending
it doesn't happen,

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:03.980 align:middle line:84%
not by pretending
injustice doesn't exist,

00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:05.470 align:middle line:90%
that's not my path of love.

00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:08.380 align:middle line:84%
By showing up and making noise
in the face of injustice,

00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:11.170 align:middle line:84%
but by not disconnecting
from your heart while

00:57:11.170 --> 00:57:12.225 align:middle line:90%
you're doing it.

00:57:12.225 --> 00:57:13.100 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does make sense.

00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:17.350 align:middle line:84%
And so that's your gift that
you offer to others, the work

00:57:17.350 --> 00:57:18.430 align:middle line:90%
you've done on yourself.

00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: I believe.

00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, with
that, I want to thank you.

00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:23.365 align:middle line:90%
We're out of time.

00:57:23.365 --> 00:57:25.240 align:middle line:84%
It's been absolutely
delightful conversation.

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Thank you.

00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:26.720 align:middle line:90%
For me too.

00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so we're
going to have people

00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:30.340 align:middle line:90%
go take a look at your book.

00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:31.140 align:middle line:90%
How's that?

00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:32.470 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: OK, sure.

00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
it's a fun ride.

00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Thank you.

00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:36.872 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like, oh my God,
I can't believe he said that.

00:57:36.872 --> 00:57:38.222 align:middle line:90%
That's so humiliating.

00:57:38.222 --> 00:57:40.180 align:middle line:84%
We didn't get into a lot
of that because that's

00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:40.980 align:middle line:90%
all in your book.

00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:43.375 align:middle line:84%
That's the flavor of
the book is just--

00:57:43.375 --> 00:57:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>STABILE: Putting
it all out there.

00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --showing yourself,
putting it all out there,

00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:47.573 align:middle line:84%
showing yourself for who you
are, warts and all, like I said

00:57:47.573 --> 00:57:48.460 align:middle line:90%
in the very beginning.

00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>>STABILE: Thank you, Regina.

00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's been delightful.

00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:50.350 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Scott.

00:57:50.350 --> 00:57:51.340 align:middle line:90%
