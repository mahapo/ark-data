>>DEBBIE SOLARIS: I had two
extraterrestrial contact

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.860 align:middle line:84%
experiences where I met up
with five Arcturian beings.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.730 align:middle line:84%
I was having massive downloads
about galactic history, star

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.010 align:middle line:90%
races, astronomy.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Earth was created to be a living
library of different genetics

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.640 align:middle line:84%
through many different
star systems.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.830 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have
this misconception

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.020 align:middle line:90%
that Pleiadians are all good--

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.490 align:middle line:90%
not necessarily.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.340 align:middle line:84%
My understanding
with the Lyrans is

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.113 align:middle line:84%
these are very open-hearted,
childlike people.

00:00:40.113 --> 00:00:42.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Which
is how they got hoodwinked.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle line:90%
They got hoodwinked.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have to understand
that we have the genetics

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.998 align:middle line:90%
of all of these species in us.

00:00:48.998 --> 00:00:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Including Reptilian.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Including reptilian.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.008 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be a
fun ride for everyone.

00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:00.550 align:middle line:10%
We're going to be
talking with Debbie

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.820 align:middle line:10%
Solaris about the starseed
origins of humanity,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.690 align:middle line:10%
and which extraterrestrial
races most represent, work with,

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.030 align:middle line:10%
and even interfere with
life here on Earth.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Debbie has had some
of her own experiences

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.200 align:middle line:84%
and does intuitive
sessions with others

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.840 align:middle line:84%
who have questions about
their origins as well.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.160 align:middle line:84%
And this conversation is
going to go into some of that.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.960 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.835 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Thank you.

00:01:20.835 --> 00:01:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also, what I
love, which your work has really

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.890 align:middle line:84%
compiled beautifully, is the
history of the galactic origins

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.100 align:middle line:84%
of the species that
we carelessly bandy

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.150 align:middle line:84%
about in today's world of
information, disinformation,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.065 align:middle line:90%
and misinformation.

00:01:38.065 --> 00:01:40.690 align:middle line:84%
So I thought it would be good to
have a nice, sane conversation

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.730 align:middle line:84%
with you about all
of these species that

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.760 align:middle line:90%
populate our galaxy.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh yeah.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.350 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be really, super
interesting to talk about all

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.560 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.018 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
it's going to be.

00:01:49.018 --> 00:01:50.830 align:middle line:84%
First of all, how
did you originally

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.927 align:middle line:84%
become fascinated
with star origins,

00:01:52.927 --> 00:01:54.760 align:middle line:84%
because that's not where
everybody naturally

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.100 align:middle line:90%
gravitates in their life?

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Well, it's actually
through my own experiences.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.340 align:middle line:10%
I had two extraterrestrial
contact experiences in 2012.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed after I
had those experiences--

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.310 align:middle line:84%
so they were out-of-body
experiences--

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.720 align:middle line:84%
I was having massive downloads
about galactic history, star

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.730 align:middle line:84%
races, astronomy, all
information that I never,

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.938 align:middle line:90%
ever even known about before.

00:02:22.938 --> 00:02:25.063 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's what
I was going to ask you.

00:02:25.063 --> 00:02:27.520 align:middle line:84%
Were you already studying and
curious about these things?

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.020 align:middle line:90%
Or this just kind of came about?

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: It just
kind of came about.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.630 align:middle line:84%
When I had the experience,
it was during dream time,

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.710 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't a dream.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.280 align:middle line:84%
It was definitely an
out of body experience

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.030 align:middle line:84%
because everything seemed
like it was in hyper-reality.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And I did notice that I was
on board some sort of a craft.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And the energies
were very intense.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.780 align:middle line:90%
The colors were intense.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.748 align:middle line:90%
The details were intense.

00:03:00.748 --> 00:03:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was part of you
afraid or fighting it at all?

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.915 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Not at all

00:03:03.915 --> 00:03:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or, did it seem OK?

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Not at all.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.730 align:middle line:90%
I never felt any fear.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.440 align:middle line:84%
I just felt maybe a
little bit of curiosity

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.130 align:middle line:84%
and maybe some bewilderment,
like why, what--

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.420 align:middle line:90%
where am I at?

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.230 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.690 align:middle line:90%
What's this?

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.130 align:middle line:90%
And the ship was sentient.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:84%
So it was kind of like a
living being of its own.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.050 align:middle line:84%
It was directing me towards some
sort of a space where I met up

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.830 align:middle line:90%
with five Arcturian beings.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, Arcturians, to a
lot of people, come as guides--

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Exactly, yeah.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --to humanity.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's not
an uncommon position

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.390 align:middle line:90%
for them to have.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.820 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'll just toss out--

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.300 align:middle line:84%
some people see them as kind
of very tall and oftentimes

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.680 align:middle line:90%
blue in color, for example.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.070 align:middle line:84%
What was your experience
of the Arcturians?

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.650 align:middle line:90%
And what did they show you?

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Well,
it was interesting.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.600 align:middle line:84%
When I approached the room,
I was already formulating

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.890 align:middle line:90%
questions in my head.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And they were
answering my questions

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.730 align:middle line:84%
even before I could finish
the question in my head.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Which was pretty
int-- so they were definitely

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.540 align:middle line:90%
tuning in to me telepathically.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was really
surprised at how

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.330 align:middle line:84%
they were able to pick up
on my telepathic thoughts.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And as far as how
they looked, it

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.780 align:middle line:84%
was really hard to
look at them directly

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.790 align:middle line:84%
because their
frequency is so high.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And I got the impression that
they were actually pulling down

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.030 align:middle line:84%
their frequency in order even
to have an interaction with me.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And they looked--
their auras were big.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.560 align:middle line:84%
That was the first thing
I noticed, was the auras.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.480 align:middle line:84%
There was colors in
the auras I had never

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.640 align:middle line:90%
seen and our spectrum here.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.180 align:middle line:84%
So when you're in the
higher realms, you see--

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.150 align:middle line:84%
there's a multitude of
even additional colors.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.520 align:middle line:84%
As many beautiful colors
as we have here on Earth,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.940 align:middle line:84%
there's a multitude
of those colors.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.030 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
that I noticed was

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.090 align:middle line:84%
when I was glancing at them
kind of like in the periphery

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.670 align:middle line:84%
or sideways, they had larger
heads, somewhat larger eyes.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.450 align:middle line:90%
The eyes had pupils and irises.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.370 align:middle line:90%
They weren't super tall.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.040 align:middle line:84%
I know some people talking
about Arcturians are tall.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.050 align:middle line:90%
These ones weren't tall.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were pulling
down their frequency

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.270 align:middle line:90%
to look less intimidating.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.870 align:middle line:90%
But they just seem like--

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.880 align:middle line:84%
the energy that
emanated from them

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.610 align:middle line:90%
was just love and acceptance.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And I felt very
comfortable with them.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, OK.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.250 align:middle line:84%
So what begs a question
right now is, why you?

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.520 align:middle line:90%
Why did this happen to you?

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, that was one
of the first questions I ask.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, I was
like, why is it me?

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And they told me that I
was part of their family,

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:12.050 align:middle line:84%
that I have chosen to be on
Earth to do a great mission,

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.430 align:middle line:90%
but I had forgotten.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And part of the reason
was because I had sent out

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.730 align:middle line:84%
a prayer two weeks before asking
for assistance for the planet--

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.540 align:middle line:90%
planet Earth.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.300 align:middle line:90%
And this came after that.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.690 align:middle line:84%
You didn't expect it
necessarily to come in this way.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, no.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.710 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:30.350 align:middle line:90%
I was--

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now, what were
you doing in your ordinary

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.020 align:middle line:90%
life--

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.140 align:middle line:90%
your regular life?

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.390 align:middle line:90%
What were you doing?

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I was actually a
health inspector for a lot

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.280 align:middle line:84%
of years, which is a
very non-spiritual--

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I worked for local government
down in Colorado Springs.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And I really had
an ordinary life.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:51.740 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Governmental tract
with benefits and all of that.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.570 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a prior Navy--

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm a Navy veteran.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.360 align:middle line:90%
So I had that background.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.550 align:middle line:84%
So I was really not oriented
toward spirituality at all.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.120 align:middle line:84%
We've got so much
to go through here--

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, I
know we got a lot.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --because
I want to get

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.200 align:middle line:90%
through the history of it all.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can start
where you want.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.880 align:middle line:90%
We can start with Lyra.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to start with
where the humanoid story came

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.320 align:middle line:84%
in, the Reptilian
story came in, and just

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.050 align:middle line:84%
let you tell that
story of what happened.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And you had a
lifetime within there.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And tell your own-- interject
your own experience of what you

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.880 align:middle line:84%
saw when you feel the
time is appropriate,

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.100 align:middle line:84%
and what happened
to these races--

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.740 align:middle line:84%
where they colonized
and so forth after.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.720 align:middle line:90%
So just tell us the story now.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: OK.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.490 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that I hear oftentimes

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.670 align:middle line:84%
in my Akashic readings
because many of us

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.390 align:middle line:84%
have had connections
with Lyra and Vega.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Lyra is called the home of human
consciousness for a reason.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:58.190 align:middle line:84%
The reason for that
is because, at least

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.250 align:middle line:84%
in our particular galaxy
and in this universe,

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:08.220 align:middle line:84%
it was where the experimentation
into physicality began.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So initially, before that, we
were all these etheric beings.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.420 align:middle line:90%
We were soul shards of source.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:18.290 align:middle line:84%
We were splitting
into Oversoul groups.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.680 align:middle line:84%
I always refer to
Galactic Center.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Galactic Center is kind
of where everything

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:84%
began, where there
was this integration

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.110 align:middle line:84%
of masculine and
feminine energies.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.570 align:middle line:84%
That's actually the
source template--

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.120 align:middle line:84%
is the feminine
and the masculine.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.760 align:middle line:84%
So everything that we
see, even in Atlantis

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:43.159 align:middle line:84%
and in future civilizations,
are based on that template.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:84%
Lyra also followed
the same template.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Lyra was created to be
a starting-off point

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:59.560 align:middle line:84%
for sentient beings to be able
to experience physicality,

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:06.650 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to experience
this separation from source.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Lyra was a very beautiful,
a very paradise-like

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:13.970 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:18.890 align:middle line:84%
It existed for thousands of
years in peace and unity.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:23.450 align:middle line:84%
However, even in Lyra, there
was two separate human races,

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.740 align:middle line:84%
or humanoid races,
that were created.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:31.930 align:middle line:84%
So there was the white,
or Caucasian Lyrans

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.000 align:middle line:90%
that were very tall beings.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.850 align:middle line:84%
They looked a little
bit more Nordic, maybe.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Those beings were more father,
god, consciousness oriented.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.230 align:middle line:84%
So they had more of a
push forward energy,

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.450 align:middle line:90%
more physical energy.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:50.320 align:middle line:84%
The blue Vega beings were
more of a mother, goddess,

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.850 align:middle line:90%
consciousness orientation.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:55.990 align:middle line:84%
So those beings, even though
they were highly technical,

00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:01.970 align:middle line:84%
had more interest in
reflection and spirituality.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And so kind of what happened
with the whole Lyra story

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.330 align:middle line:84%
is kind of a lesson for
a lot of us, I think.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.170 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us, I think,
it's easy to fall

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:20.740 align:middle line:84%
into complacency and naivety
when everything is going well.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.170 align:middle line:84%
When everything is
going well, it's

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.860 align:middle line:84%
easy just to kind of take
it for granted and to not

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.670 align:middle line:84%
be consciously aware of
what's happening around us.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.130 align:middle line:84%
That is what happened--
that's the Lyran and story.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:33.930 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:38.020 align:middle line:84%
The Lyrans-- and even to
a certain extent the Vega

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.250 align:middle line:90%
beings--

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:44.150 align:middle line:84%
felt that-- I think they
just kind of got complacent.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And so when the
Draconians that were

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.140 align:middle line:90%
in the constellation next door--

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.170 align:middle line:84%
so the Draconians were of
a different consciousness.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.750 align:middle line:84%
These were beings that
were originally kicked out

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.990 align:middle line:90%
of a different universe.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And they ended up,
I think, somehow

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.630 align:middle line:90%
got deposited and Draco.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.480 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.470 align:middle line:84%
They were not very happy
about that, obviously.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.890 align:middle line:84%
They felt that they were
an ancient race of beings.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:18.110 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to conquer
the galaxy at least,

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.870 align:middle line:90%
if not the universe.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.330 align:middle line:90%
These beings saw Lyra.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And they pretty much
saw a sitting duck.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:29.110 align:middle line:84%
You know they saw
the Lyran system

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.020 align:middle line:84%
and they thought, wow,
they got a lot of resources

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.220 align:middle line:90%
on their planet.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.810 align:middle line:84%
We could use some
of those resources.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:37.060 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
conquer that system.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.240 align:middle line:84%
But they did it through
deception, which is really--

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.157 align:middle line:84%
I think we're kind of
seeing the same themes--

00:11:42.157 --> 00:11:42.957 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh yes.

00:11:42.957 --> 00:11:44.125 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Even in today's--

00:11:44.125 --> 00:11:44.312 align:middle line:90%


00:11:44.312 --> 00:11:44.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: World.

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:45.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: --world.

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, very much so.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: So they
reached out to the Lyrans

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:51.940 align:middle line:84%
and they wanted to
create some sort

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.690 align:middle line:84%
of a treaty or an
agreement that they

00:11:55.690 --> 00:12:00.400 align:middle line:84%
were going to trade their
technology for the Lyran

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.600 align:middle line:90%
resources.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And the Lyrans didn't
really vet them very well.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Or, they didn't
really think, OK,

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.050 align:middle line:84%
why are these beings all of
a sudden interested in us?

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.960 align:middle line:84%
They just saw the technology
and thought, oh yes, we could

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.650 align:middle line:90%
really use better technology.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:17.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sounds like
some Earth people.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I know.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It sounds like us.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.985 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, it
does sound like us.

00:12:20.985 --> 00:12:23.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these people
were us at one time.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:28.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so they basically
just said, well,

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.330 align:middle line:84%
they just kind of rushed
into this agreement

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:35.260 align:middle line:84%
and allowed you know the access
to Lyra to the Draconian.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:84%
The Draconians used
that opportunity

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:45.640 align:middle line:84%
to pretty much see where
their weak areas were.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.620 align:middle line:90%
And they ambushed.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.890 align:middle line:84%
It was probably the
most catastrophic event.

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So they ambushed
the entire system.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Some of the planets
that were initially hit

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.645 align:middle line:90%
was Avalon, Avion, Bela.

00:12:58.645 --> 00:13:01.930 align:middle line:90%
And there was a few others.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.570 align:middle line:84%
It was so catastrophic
that, I think,

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Lyssa Royal Holt says
that 50 million Lyrans

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.720 align:middle line:90%
lost their lives.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.460 align:middle line:84%
I have my own personal memories
of what happened in Lyra.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.400 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And talk about the nature and
physicality of the Draconians.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh absolutely.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:22.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us
about them and then

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.135 align:middle line:84%
tell us about your
personal experience.

00:13:24.135 --> 00:13:25.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: OK.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:30.700 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain caste system
within the Draconian races.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:34.480 align:middle line:84%
So there's more than just
one type of Draconian.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.150 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people
just tend to lump them into,

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.630 align:middle line:90%
oh yeah, they're lizards.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:39.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:40.435 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.435 --> 00:13:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: But there is
actually a higher caste,

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:46.210 align:middle line:84%
which was the dragons,
who were more--

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.910 align:middle line:84%
to my understanding
were more neutral.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:54.242 align:middle line:84%
So they weren't really the
hard harbingers of the war.

00:13:54.242 --> 00:13:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They weren't
the warrior class.

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:56.750 align:middle line:90%


00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: No, the warrior
class is the next level.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:03.370 align:middle line:84%
There was a rivalry between the
dragon caste and the warrior

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:90%
caste.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:09.070 align:middle line:84%
The warrior caste
always felt like, well,

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.360 align:middle line:90%
why are they top tier?

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.880 align:middle line:90%
We should be top tier.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.510 align:middle line:84%
If we conquer many
different systems,

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:18.875 align:middle line:84%
maybe we can topple them
off of their position.

00:14:18.875 --> 00:14:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, are these more
of what we would understand

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.743 align:middle line:84%
is classic
Reptilian-looking beings.

00:14:23.743 --> 00:14:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:25.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
lower reptilians.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.550 align:middle line:84%
So there's reptilians
whose genetics

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.620 align:middle line:84%
were used maybe for
some of the reptiles

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:37.600 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth that were
back in the dinosaur ages.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.440 align:middle line:90%
So these--

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even getting into
the common creatures of today--

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.640 align:middle line:84%
alligators, crocodiles,
and so forth.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.807 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:14:46.807 --> 00:14:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lower Draconian tier--

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Tier.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.255 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --genetics

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Genetics.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.710 align:middle line:84%
I think for a while
the Draconians had

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:55.300 align:middle line:90%
taken over Earth.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:59.680 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
Earth access used to be--

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Earth's pole used
to be aligned--

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:07.210 align:middle line:84%
North Pole used to be aligned
with Thuban, which is in Draco.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Now it's aligned with
Polaris, as you know.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:14.260 align:middle line:84%
But for thousands of years,
it was aligned with Thuban

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:18.280 align:middle line:84%
because Draconians had control
over Earth for a while.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.470 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
many experimentations

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.790 align:middle line:84%
for genetic experimentations
that occurred on Earth.

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:23.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.900 align:middle line:84%
So let's go to your personal
experience during those wars.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: OK.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
before we start kind

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.800 align:middle line:84%
of colonizing Earth,
and time frames,

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.620 align:middle line:84%
and the different species
that came because we

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.463 align:middle line:84%
are the potpourri,
we are the bar

00:15:37.463 --> 00:15:38.630 align:middle line:90%
at the edge of the universe.

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, we are.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:42.340 align:middle line:84%
We kind of a nice, interesting
blend of 22 different star

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:42.730 align:middle line:90%
races

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get to quite a few
of them, but not all of them.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:49.570 align:middle line:84%
So what was your
personal experience?

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: My understanding
from, I guess,

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:57.080 align:middle line:84%
my own access to my own
Akashic records is that I was

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.760 align:middle line:90%
an Arcturian emissary that was--

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.850 align:middle line:90%
I didn't incarnate as Lyran.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:07.420 align:middle line:84%
When I saw myself, I
look like an Arcturian.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.510 align:middle line:84%
But because Lyra at the
time was higher dimensional,

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:14.680 align:middle line:84%
I was able to be there
in Arcturian form.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.815 align:middle line:84%
I was there acting as
an emissary and as a,

00:16:17.815 --> 00:16:23.160 align:middle line:84%
I think, an advisor
to the Lyran council--

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.700 align:middle line:84%
kind of like an
Arcturian advisor.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, was this
when the troubles began?

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:27.210 align:middle line:90%
Where you present?

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh yeah.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:37.490 align:middle line:84%
I remember warning the Lyrans
not to get into any agreement--

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Business
dealings with them.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah,
with the Draconians.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:46.070 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't heed
my warnings, evidently.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:50.510 align:middle line:84%
What I saw in my own personal
past life regression work

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.280 align:middle line:90%
that I did on myself--

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.690 align:middle line:90%
and it traumatized me.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.250 align:middle line:90%
It re-traumatized me.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.650 align:middle line:90%
I had to do some work around it.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:00.755 align:middle line:90%
But it was horrific.

00:17:00.755 --> 00:17:03.560 align:middle line:90%


00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:10.010 align:middle line:84%
When I think about how horribly
they attacked Lyra, it was--

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:11.359 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: By what means?

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: It was through
quite a bit of bombing, lasers,

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:20.810 align:middle line:84%
there was troops on the ground
that was slaughtering people,

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:22.932 align:middle line:84%
chopping them up into
different pieces.

00:17:22.932 --> 00:17:24.140 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was just horrific.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It sounds
like low-tech warfare

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:28.160 align:middle line:90%
with high technology available.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:28.339 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:28.910 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:29.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: It was
like they wanted

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:33.190 align:middle line:84%
to terrorize the Lyrans
as much as possible,

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:34.390 align:middle line:90%
which they definitely did.

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:35.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:39.140 align:middle line:84%
So that was-- apparently, you
didn't help them avoid that one

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.090 align:middle line:84%
and back in your
role in the day.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And so after this
devastation, what happened?

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.100 align:middle line:90%
When did the two split off?

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.380 align:middle line:90%
And where did they go next?

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:52.255 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: As far as?

00:17:52.255 --> 00:17:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As far
as the species--

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:54.740 align:middle line:90%
the Lyrans, for example.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:02.360 align:middle line:84%
My understanding with some of
the Starfleet-- so Lyra did

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.060 align:middle line:84%
have enough technology
to have Starfleet.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.428 align:middle line:90%
It was in the beginning stages.

00:18:06.428 --> 00:18:07.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
were so interested

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.760 align:middle line:90%
in Draconian technology.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have
quite the weaponry

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:17.210 align:middle line:84%
or some of the sophistication
of the Draconian ships.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:21.800 align:middle line:84%
But my understanding
with Avalon--

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.930 align:middle line:84%
the planet Avalon--
was that most

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:27.590 align:middle line:84%
of the fleet headed
to the Pleiades.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:32.960 align:middle line:84%
With Avion, they decided
to do things differently.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.540 align:middle line:84%
I think they saw the
mistakes that Avalon made

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:39.030 align:middle line:84%
and they thought, OK,
we need to survive.

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:43.710 align:middle line:84%
So it was all about
survival at that point.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.890 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
split up our fleet.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are going
to head Sirius.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are going
to head to Andromeda.

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.402 align:middle line:84%
And some of us will head to
the Pleiades and other systems.

00:18:52.402 --> 00:18:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And there was actually
many more systems.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:58.302 align:middle line:84%
I'm just kind of using that as
a general frame of reference.

00:18:58.302 --> 00:18:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And was the Lyrans.

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:00.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: The Lyrans, yeah.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:04.220 align:middle line:90%
And so these beings were of a--

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.610 align:middle line:84%
now, when you were talking about
the-- there were the Caucasian

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Lyrans, there were there
with the blue Vegans.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: The Vegans also
got involved with the wars.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.640 align:middle line:84%
They got involved
a little bit later.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.850 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't have
quite the devastation

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:22.940 align:middle line:84%
that Lyra had-- or the
other Lyran star systems.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.570 align:middle line:84%
But they also had
better technology.

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:27.180 align:middle line:90%


00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about the psychospiritual

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.840 align:middle line:84%
development, mental
development of the Lyrans.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.830 align:middle line:90%
What were their capacities?

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.415 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: As far as
when they were in Lyra?

00:19:41.415 --> 00:19:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When
they were in Lyra,

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.730 align:middle line:84%
before they were
damaged and went

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:50.440 align:middle line:84%
through the trauma and then
emigrated to other places.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: My understanding
with the Lyrans

00:19:52.510 --> 00:20:00.468 align:middle line:84%
is these are very
open-hearted, childlike people.

00:20:00.468 --> 00:20:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is how
they got hoodwinked.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.100 align:middle line:90%
They got hoodwinked.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:04.600 align:middle line:90%
And the Draconian knew it.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:05.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:05.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: They knew it.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.310 align:middle line:90%


00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:13.780 align:middle line:84%
When I work with people
with Lyran heritage,

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:17.170 align:middle line:84%
these are people that feel
very connected to the land.

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:20.920 align:middle line:90%
They love a simpler lifestyle.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.380 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them tend to--
if they do healing work,

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:28.355 align:middle line:84%
they tend more towards herbology
or naturopathic medicine,

00:20:28.355 --> 00:20:29.155 align:middle line:90%
anything--

00:20:29.155 --> 00:20:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Are they empathetic?

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah,
very empathetic.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:32.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:90%
I would say so.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:40.120 align:middle line:84%
But their downside is
the naivety, the tendency

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:46.210 align:middle line:90%
to be attracted to maybe--

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:49.330 align:middle line:84%
let me see if I can
find the right words.

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.670 align:middle line:84%
They're attracted to
relationships that are not

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.260 align:middle line:90%
for their best interest.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Even with Lyrans I work
with today, a lot of them

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:00.010 align:middle line:84%
get into very
unhealthy relationships

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.260 align:middle line:84%
until they get very
well integrated.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.583 align:middle line:84%
After they do the inner work,
that's not the case anymore.

00:21:05.583 --> 00:21:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
they're so naive

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.320 align:middle line:84%
and they're thinking
this shiny thing

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.278 align:middle line:84%
is going to somehow make
them better, or whole,

00:21:10.278 --> 00:21:12.220 align:middle line:84%
or offer them something
rather than learning

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.510 align:middle line:90%
to develop it from within?

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.900 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:14.050 align:middle line:90%


00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Kind of what I see
with Lyran starseeds

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:22.385 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a sense of
incompleteness within them--

00:21:22.385 --> 00:21:23.185 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:21:23.185 --> 00:21:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: --because they
lost their star system.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.455 align:middle line:84%
So they have this feeling of,
I can never go back home again.

00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of maybe
looking for external power?

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:30.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Power.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:32.890 align:middle line:90%
OK that makes sense.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.940 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for sharing that part.

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's take a
look at how long

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:48.220 align:middle line:84%
ago the Reptilians came here,
where they initially resided,

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.510 align:middle line:90%
what they were up to.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And then, in contrasting that,
let's take a look at how long

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.822 align:middle line:84%
ago the Pleiadians arrived here
and what they were up to, just

00:21:55.822 --> 00:21:58.030 align:middle line:84%
because these are probably
the most well-known groups

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:58.830 align:middle line:90%
to our viewer.

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.000 align:middle line:90%
Let's do the Reptilians first.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.800 align:middle line:84%
The Reptilians obviously
expanded their forces out

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.130 align:middle line:90%
throughout the galaxy.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:15.430 align:middle line:84%
They didn't initially
go straight to Earth.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.350 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people
think, oh, you know,

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:18.970 align:middle line:90%
they went from Draco to Earth.

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:21.560 align:middle line:84%
I think it was kind
of a progression.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:27.850 align:middle line:84%
They kind of operate
towards a mindset of,

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:30.130 align:middle line:84%
where is the most
strategic spots

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.650 align:middle line:84%
and where can we
have the most power?

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I think after the
Lyran Wars were over,

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:40.910 align:middle line:90%
they looked at Orion.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:41.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Orion is a
huge, huge constellation.

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.350 align:middle line:90%
A lot of stars in Orion.

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's in kind of a
strategic spot in our galaxy.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:57.130 align:middle line:84%
So they felt that, if
we can take over Orion,

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:00.850 align:middle line:84%
it would be a very good
vantage point for them.

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And Orion is really
close to Sirius.

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.400 align:middle line:90%
It's close to Procyon.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.820 align:middle line:90%
It's close to Zeta Reticuli.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:13.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it has a really great
vantage point, as far as--

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.350 align:middle line:90%
astronomically speaking.

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: The
Reptilians started

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:25.790 align:middle line:84%
creating bases and outposts in
some of the Orion star systems,

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:30.550 align:middle line:84%
particularly Rigel,
Bellatrix, and Betelgeuse.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:33.490 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime,
you had the Vega--

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:34.750 align:middle line:90%
most of the Vega people--

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:37.030 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get a chance
to mention this before.

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:39.340 align:middle line:84%
They were also
sending refugees out.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And their ships were heading
towards Sirius and Orion.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:49.540 align:middle line:84%
So there was Vega ships
that ended up in Sirius A

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and also some that ended up
in the belt stars of Orion.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.890 align:middle line:90%
So these were people that--

00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:00.595 align:middle line:84%
I think there was a mixed crowd
in some of these Orion systems.

00:24:00.595 --> 00:24:02.470 align:middle line:84%
I always liken it to
Star Wars because it's--

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:04.000 align:middle line:90%
The cantina.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, the cantina.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:07.210 align:middle line:90%
I always bring that up.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:11.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's a fun analogy
of what Orion was like.

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:21.860 align:middle line:84%
But what I did see with Orion
is there was a lot of conflicts.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Duality consciousness
was prevalent

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.230 align:middle line:90%
there because you had--

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:32.070 align:middle line:84%
it was kind of became the
melting pot of the galaxy.

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:34.130 align:middle line:84%
So kind of like United
States is the melting pot

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.350 align:middle line:84%
of the planet, that's
how Orion was like.

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And so you had all
these different beings

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:84%
that were trying to
coexist with one another.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And they were squabbling over
territories, and planets,

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.300 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And the Reptilians
obviously were

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.630 align:middle line:84%
interested in conquering the
belt stars because they're

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:53.880 align:middle line:90%
all or nothing kind of beings.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Because what they do.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:56.840 align:middle line:84%
They're all or nothing
kind of beings.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:02.240 align:middle line:84%
So these beings, I think,
work in constant conflict

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.880 align:middle line:84%
with what initially
was developed--

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.830 align:middle line:84%
or, eventually
what was developed

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:09.410 align:middle line:84%
was the Black League
resistance fighters.

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:17.990 align:middle line:84%
So these were kind of a military
force in the Orion belt stars

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:21.110 align:middle line:84%
that were trying to
fight for their freedom

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:22.910 align:middle line:90%
and their unification.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, I just want to
make really clear is

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:33.230 align:middle line:84%
that there's no all black or
all white in these systems.

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:35.270 align:middle line:84%
The Black League
resistance fighters

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.490 align:middle line:90%
weren't necessarily all good.

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And the Empire wasn't
necessarily all evil.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:41.850 align:middle line:90%


00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:42.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:43.405 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I hear you.

00:25:43.405 --> 00:25:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Actually, OK, so
then at what point do

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:49.070 align:middle line:84%
they start making
their way to Earth?

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think
this happened--

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:56.630 align:middle line:84%
this is my understanding, is
the Black League resistance

00:25:56.630 --> 00:26:00.330 align:middle line:84%
fighters asked for help from
the Galactic Federation.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:03.000 align:middle line:84%
We bring up the Galactic
Federation quite a bit,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.220 align:middle line:84%
which is an alliance
between benevolent beings

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:11.330 align:middle line:84%
that wanted to keep peace and
unity throughout the galaxy.

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's many different
types of beings that

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:16.310 align:middle line:90%
are members of the Federation--

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:18.350 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily all
humanoid either.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.840 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
non-humanoids that are also

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.420 align:middle line:90%
members of the Federation.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.420 align:middle line:84%
The Federation started
getting more and more involved

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:32.150 align:middle line:84%
with the Lyran conflicts, trying
to create some sense of peace

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:37.400 align:middle line:84%
and maybe an outreach to some of
the different groups in Orion.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.700 align:middle line:90%
And this took quite a few years.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.450 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't like
an overnight thing.

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:42.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this took--

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Orion has been in conflict
for millions of years.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:56.630 align:middle line:10%
So the Galactic Federation,
from what I saw,

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:58.500 align:middle line:10%
helped to bring about--

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.320 align:middle line:10%
and I think it was a
collaborative effort

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:04.730 align:middle line:10%
between the Orion groups
and the Orion Light

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:07.700 align:middle line:10%
Council, which is actually
based out of Orion nebula--

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:12.720 align:middle line:10%
and, also, some of the Galactic
Federation, the Pleiadians,

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.620 align:middle line:10%
Sirians, all of them.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.820 align:middle line:84%
They ended up creating a
sense of peace and unity

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.330 align:middle line:90%
throughout the Orion system.

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:24.770 align:middle line:84%
So Orion has become, I think,
one of the newest members

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:25.980 align:middle line:90%
of the Galactic Federation.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:27.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: But then there was
dark factions in the Orion

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:33.380 align:middle line:84%
system that didn't necessarily
want to be part of the light.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:36.183 align:middle line:84%
So they had to look
for new frontiers.

00:27:36.183 --> 00:27:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: New terrain.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah,
for new frontiers--

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:44.520 align:middle line:84%
new place to do their power
stuff, their power work.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.320 align:middle line:90%


00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, Earth is juicy.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, juicy.

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's got
a lot going on here.

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of beauty,
a lot of resources,

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:54.020 align:middle line:90%
some kind of naive human beings.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.385 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, some really
undeveloped human beings.

00:27:56.385 --> 00:27:57.185 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:57.185 --> 00:27:58.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: So Earth looked
like a really likely spot.

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:03.500 align:middle line:90%
It looked like, yeah, we can--

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.060 align:middle line:90%
yeah, it's a smaller planet.

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.670 align:middle line:84%
But it's a lot
going on on Earth.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Earth was created to
be a living library.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.180 align:middle line:84%
So Earth was created to
be like this composite

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:19.370 align:middle line:84%
of different genetics through
many different star systems.

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:21.860 align:middle line:84%
That's why you see all
the diversity here, even

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.610 align:middle line:90%
with the humans here.

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:25.310 align:middle line:84%
We know there's a lot
of diversity here.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: And all of us
carry a multitude of genetics

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.860 align:middle line:90%
from different statuses.

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:33.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.690 align:middle line:84%
To your point, we
have to understand

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:40.278 align:middle line:84%
that we have the genetics of
all of these species in us--

00:28:40.278 --> 00:28:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Including Reptilian.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Including reptilian.

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:45.470 align:middle line:84%
We have all of this
within us because they've

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:46.800 align:middle line:90%
been here a long time.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, not just
them, but the Reptilians

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:54.410 align:middle line:84%
are master geneticists so they
could work with human DNA.

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:55.950 align:middle line:90%
We had hybridized species--

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:56.750 align:middle line:90%
we always have.

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Oh yeah, there
was hybridized species

00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:59.890 align:middle line:90%
that came out of Sirius.

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:00.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:00.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.462 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You could
even say that all

00:29:02.462 --> 00:29:05.210 align:middle line:84%
of the various features of
human beings and the races

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.725 align:middle line:84%
all had various influences
from various star systems.

00:29:07.725 --> 00:29:09.100 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a
fair thing to say.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Absolutely.

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I think it's
important to note that

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:16.460 align:middle line:84%
with each of these beings
come some advantages

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:20.720 align:middle line:84%
and disadvantages in terms of
how our deep, deep psyche has

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.970 align:middle line:84%
been developed over
millions of years.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:25.050 align:middle line:90%
So there we go.

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:26.180 align:middle line:90%
We've talked a little bit.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:26.980 align:middle line:90%
They're still here.

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Barbara Hand Clow's coming
out with a new book.

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:31.640 align:middle line:84%
She's really going
further than she's ever

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:34.250 align:middle line:84%
gone into the effect
of the Reptilians

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:37.200 align:middle line:84%
and the fourth dimension
on planet Earth right now.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.310 align:middle line:90%
It's fabulous.

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:39.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not out yet.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:41.340 align:middle line:90%
I just got a galley from her.

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:43.310 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to take
that trip through her

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:44.300 align:middle line:90%
as well a little later.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.780 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's go to
the Pl-- speaking of Barbara,

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:49.550 align:middle line:84%
now let's go to the Pleiades
and talk about their influence,

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:52.340 align:middle line:84%
because you say they've been
here about 225,000 years?

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh yeah.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:58.010 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadians have went through
their own similar evolution

00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:01.242 align:middle line:84%
in their history that we've
gone through here on--

00:30:01.242 --> 00:30:03.450 align:middle line:84%
that we're now currently
going through here on Earth.

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:06.870 align:middle line:84%
So their evolution started
a million years ago.

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:09.710 align:middle line:84%
So a million years ago, they
were struggling with a lot

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:13.190 align:middle line:84%
of the same issues that
we have here on Earth--

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:15.720 align:middle line:84%
maybe not quite to the extreme
that we see here on Earth,

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.520 align:middle line:90%
but--

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As a result
of colonization,

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:20.070 align:middle line:84%
or a split within
their own people, or--

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.870 align:middle line:90%
what do--

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:21.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Both.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:22.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, both.

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:27.450 align:middle line:84%
I think it was-- they were
expanding in their own--

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:29.360 align:middle line:84%
so the Pleiades
is a star cluster.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's quite a
few different stars.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And each of these stars
have their own civilization,

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:39.350 align:middle line:84%
their own culture under the
umbrella of the Pleiadian

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:43.130 align:middle line:90%
unification but.

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:45.500 align:middle line:84%
But there was also a
split in the Pleiades

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.990 align:middle line:84%
where I think the
Pleiadians, because they

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:52.310 align:middle line:84%
were trying to heal from the
wounds of their ancestors--

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:56.550 align:middle line:84%
most of their ancestors
were Lyran refugees.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: And so they
dealt with trauma signatures

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:02.640 align:middle line:90%
within their own genetics.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And so they became
ultra-focused on the light

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:12.770 align:middle line:84%
and didn't know how to integrate
the darkness within them, which

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:16.640 align:middle line:84%
created the split of
your positive Pleiadians

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.620 align:middle line:90%
and your more rogue Pleiadians.

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.960 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
have this misconception

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.390 align:middle line:90%
that aliens are all good.

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily-- they
may look beautiful

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:27.410 align:middle line:90%
but they're not all good.

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:30.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
some rogue ones.

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
rogue aliens ended up

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.670 align:middle line:90%
joining forces with Orion.

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:35.795 align:middle line:90%
That's a whole other story.

00:31:35.795 --> 00:31:38.900 align:middle line:90%


00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.550 align:middle line:90%
So there was this split.

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And then they had to
find their way back

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:45.410 align:middle line:84%
towards integration, which is
kind of what we're seeing here

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.500 align:middle line:84%
on Earth right now,
where factions are very

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.140 align:middle line:84%
split right now, especially
here in our country.

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.955 align:middle line:84%
But we're also trying to find
our way back to integration.

00:31:54.955 --> 00:31:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you
think that there

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:59.540 align:middle line:84%
is a Reptilian influence
at the base of the chasm

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:01.698 align:middle line:90%
and split in our world?

00:32:01.698 --> 00:32:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, without a doubt.

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:04.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:05.785 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
do you think their--

00:32:05.785 --> 00:32:08.210 align:middle line:84%
do you think it's
an endgame for them

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:11.570 align:middle line:84%
because, really, their
time's coming to a close?

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Or, this is just a continuation
of what they always do

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:16.220 align:middle line:90%
and toward what end?

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I think
it's an endgame.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.262 align:middle line:84%
I think they're pulling out
all the stops at this point.

00:32:20.262 --> 00:32:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's what I feel.

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, I
don't see their reign

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:27.750 align:middle line:90%
lasting for much longer.

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:30.090 align:middle line:84%
I think within
the next 10 years,

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:33.530 align:middle line:84%
we're going to see a
lot of mass changes

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:37.520 align:middle line:84%
politically,
economically, socially--

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:41.120 align:middle line:84%
economically on
all here on Earth.

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And some of it's going
to be really hard.

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.710 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be hard for
people, especially those that

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:48.710 align:middle line:84%
aren't already awakened, which
obviously doesn't include

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:51.440 align:middle line:90%
most of your viewers on Gaia.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is true because
one thing we're all part of

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.270 align:middle line:84%
is the systems that
have been created

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and that we've helped either
create or allowed to happen.

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And once those
start deteriorating

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.573 align:middle line:84%
to give way to
something better, people

00:33:07.573 --> 00:33:09.740 align:middle line:84%
lose the security of what
they've become comfortable

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:09.960 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.192 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even right
now, just the argument

00:33:12.192 --> 00:33:16.160 align:middle line:84%
between kind of old
economy and the old way

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.590 align:middle line:84%
the financial markets work,
which are just screwed up.

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh yeah.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.098 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, I mean,
the stock market--

00:33:22.098 --> 00:33:25.550 align:middle line:84%
you have the worst tumult
in history in America

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:28.020 align:middle line:84%
and the markets are
just rising by the day.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.120 align:middle line:90%
They're just having fun.

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.510 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't make sense anymore.

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:32.718 align:middle line:84%
So whatever corruption is
at the base of those system

00:33:32.718 --> 00:33:36.170 align:middle line:84%
will have to give way to
something ultimately healthier.

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:38.753 align:middle line:84%
And then you have something like
Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies,

00:33:38.753 --> 00:33:40.628 align:middle line:84%
where people can't get
their minds around it.

00:33:40.628 --> 00:33:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but it can't
hold anything.

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:43.490 align:middle line:90%
And that makes people anxious.

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:45.720 align:middle line:84%
How do I invest in something
I can't spend or hold?

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you've got
that dynamic going on.

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:49.873 align:middle line:84%
Then you have people
saying, no, let's

00:33:49.873 --> 00:33:52.080 align:middle line:90%
go back to working together.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to collaborating
in real ways and production.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Lot of conflicting
thoughts and ideas

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:02.000 align:middle line:84%
going on even now that will
probably deepen, as you say,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.820 align:middle line:84%
as we go into this next
decade out of necessity,

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:06.510 align:middle line:90%
and absolute necessity.

00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:07.880 align:middle line:90%
We have to change our systems.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.989 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh yeah.

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:11.909 align:middle line:84%
It can't continue
the way it has been.

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:16.639 align:middle line:84%
And we saw this same evolution
throughout even prior star

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:18.980 align:middle line:90%
systems, like Sirius.

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Sirius had their own
internal conflicts.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.350 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think
of Sirius as, oh, that's

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:28.500 align:middle line:84%
the home of the ascended masters
and it's all love and light.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:32.135 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it took them millions
of years to get to that point.

00:34:32.135 --> 00:34:32.310 align:middle line:90%


00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Same with the
Pleiades, same with Orion--

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:40.699 align:middle line:84%
the only star systems I
think didn't go through

00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:44.040 align:middle line:84%
that similar evolution was
Andromeda and Arcturus.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:44.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to tell you,
what I had planned here--

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:49.190 align:middle line:84%
as you know, I have
way too many notes

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:51.290 align:middle line:84%
because I'm so curious
about what you have to say.

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:54.719 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What I'd
like to do is this--

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:57.290 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into every
one of those cultures

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.240 align:middle line:84%
and how they have
lived and so forth

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.800 align:middle line:90%
and their history separately.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.900 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to have you
back for another show--

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:03.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, well thank you.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.617 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --if
that works for you,

00:35:04.617 --> 00:35:07.430 align:middle line:84%
because there's no way we have
time to do all that in the time

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:10.070 align:middle line:90%
left, and instead focus now--

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:13.340 align:middle line:84%
kind of wrap up where we've
been on this history, how

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.400 align:middle line:90%
they ended up here.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to go into the others

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:19.550 align:middle line:84%
later, and multidimensionality,
and multidimensional contact--

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:22.443 align:middle line:84%
interdimensional contact--
in our next show,

00:35:22.443 --> 00:35:24.110 align:middle line:84%
which I'm sure the
producers are saying,

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:25.220 align:middle line:90%
what, we didn't plan that.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.090 align:middle line:90%
But we'll do it.

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:26.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.750 align:middle line:90%
Sounds good.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:27.440 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to talk
about the work you do

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:35.750 align:middle line:84%
and why it matters to us to
know about our galactic history

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:38.510 align:middle line:84%
as human beings and
individuals-- who ends up

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:42.560 align:middle line:84%
on your doorstep, and maybe
a couple of stories of what

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.750 align:middle line:84%
you've dealt with, what
people are dealing with,

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:45.860 align:middle line:90%
and take us through that.

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:46.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: OK.

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:48.890 align:middle line:84%
That will be an
interesting segue.

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:51.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:52.850 align:middle line:90%
The reason why--

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:56.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is just through
thousands of Akashic readings

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:58.190 align:middle line:84%
I've done throughout
the last few years,

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:06.350 align:middle line:84%
but I'm finding that even
though we're all ancient souls,

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:10.700 align:middle line:84%
we've all had experiences
in multiple star systems,

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:15.020 align:middle line:84%
multiple dimensions, we still
kind of carry the same themes,

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:21.230 align:middle line:84%
the same lessons, the same
challenges throughout each

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:23.720 align:middle line:90%
of our incarnations.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:27.170 align:middle line:84%
So as far as galactic
history is concerned,

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:31.220 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned a little bit
about of what the Lyran

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:34.280 align:middle line:84%
pitfalls are-- because we were
talking about that quite a bit.

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:37.190 align:middle line:84%
I see the same thing
with other star systems,

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:40.700 align:middle line:84%
where because of
their evolution,

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:45.740 align:middle line:84%
they develop certain personality
traits, or a certain skill

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.990 align:middle line:90%
sets, or certain mindsets.

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
interesting sometimes

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:51.540 align:middle line:84%
for me to see, oh
yes, this person--

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know
where you're from.

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:55.400 align:middle line:84%
It's like, yeah, I
can tell where you're

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.847 align:middle line:90%
from just by your personality.

00:36:56.847 --> 00:36:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
talk about that.

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:01.163 align:middle line:84%
No naming names, of course-- but
maybe a few different clients

00:37:01.163 --> 00:37:02.705 align:middle line:84%
that have come across
your doorstep--

00:37:02.705 --> 00:37:03.505 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yep.

00:37:03.505 --> 00:37:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that you
found really intriguing.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:09.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I love
Andromeda Galaxy souls.

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:11.820 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I love all of them.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:12.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:16.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's kind of like, who's
to say who's better the other.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:21.100 align:middle line:84%
But I have clients
from Andromeda Galaxy

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.350 align:middle line:90%
that are very high vibrational.

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:25.750 align:middle line:84%
But they have a
hard time fitting

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:29.710 align:middle line:84%
into the physical
reality here on Earth.

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:31.870 align:middle line:84%
Andromeda Galaxy, I
just want to point out,

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:35.210 align:middle line:84%
is a different location than
Andromeda constellation.

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, so Andromeda
Galaxy is the galaxy.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.070 align:middle line:90%
It's 2 million light years away.

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Andromeda constellation
is 2,000 light years away.

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:46.570 align:middle line:90%
It's the constellation.

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:49.420 align:middle line:90%
It's within our galaxy.

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:52.270 align:middle line:84%
So there is Andromeda
constellation people

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.460 align:middle line:90%
and Andromeda Galaxy people.

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:57.640 align:middle line:84%
The Andromeda Galaxy people
are ancient souls that are

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:01.380 align:middle line:90%
co-creators, and they're--

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.630 align:middle line:84%
usually love to
work with frequency.

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:07.030 align:middle line:84%
But they have a hard
time sometimes navigating

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:13.120 align:middle line:84%
around reality or
physical reality.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:17.530 align:middle line:84%
However, once they get aligned
with the physical reality,

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:19.570 align:middle line:90%
their master manifestors.

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:23.270 align:middle line:84%
So these people can
manifest almost anything.

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:24.760 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of them
do end up becoming

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:30.400 align:middle line:84%
quite successful at whatever
chosen work that they do.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.610 align:middle line:90%
I had a client that--

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:35.992 align:middle line:90%
she was an energy worker.

00:38:35.992 --> 00:38:38.200 align:middle line:84%
She actually ended up becoming
a good friend of mine.

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.240 align:middle line:90%
But she started off as a client.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.640 align:middle line:90%
And she's here in Denver.

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And she was doing all
this energy healing.

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:51.280 align:middle line:84%
But she didn't have
any frame of reference

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.620 align:middle line:84%
or any explanation of
what she was doing.

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:53.770 align:middle line:90%


00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:53.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.190 align:middle line:90%
She just knew how to do it.

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: She just
knew how to do it.

00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:56.790 --> 00:39:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: And so she had
an Akashic reading with me.

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And so we kind of
did an exchange

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:08.930 align:middle line:84%
where she would
do a healing on me

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:11.620 align:middle line:84%
and I would do an
Akashic reading on her.

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And I told her, oh yes,
you're from Andromeda Galaxy

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.910 align:middle line:84%
and frequency work
is natural for you.

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:22.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't
even need tools.

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:23.950 align:middle line:84%
You're just channeling
in those frequencies

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:25.090 align:middle line:90%
from the Andromeda Galaxy.

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:26.640 align:middle line:90%


00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.630 align:middle line:90%
And she was fascinated by this.

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And then when she was
doing a healing on me,

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:36.730 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing images of
the Andromeda Galaxy.

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was telling
her, holy cow, girl,

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:42.190 align:middle line:84%
you're bringing in
some frequencies.

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And she's one of the most
phenomenal energy healers

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:47.080 align:middle line:90%
I've ever encountered.

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh my god,
that's wonderful.

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: She can heal
people of back pain--

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:54.940 align:middle line:90%
I mean, all kinds of illnesses.

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:58.330 align:middle line:84%
She's a super phenomenal--
but what she got out

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:02.240 align:middle line:84%
of her interaction with me was
an understanding of why she is

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.490 align:middle line:90%
the way she is the way she is.

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:06.010 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:07.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
a couple others,

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:10.960 align:middle line:84%
like a maybe Pleiadian
encounter-- again,

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.580 align:middle line:90%
because everyone knows them--

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:14.960 align:middle line:84%
a Pleiadian being and what
their challenges might be,

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.873 align:middle line:84%
and if you had some
Reptilian clients.

00:40:16.873 --> 00:40:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: I have, actually.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: We'll do the
Pleiadian first though.

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: So I had a
Pleiadians client who--

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:28.420 align:middle line:90%


00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:31.810 align:middle line:90%
she was a dog groomer.

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:33.900 align:middle line:90%
Pleiadians are empathic people.

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.630 align:middle line:84%
They're empathic with a
capital E. They love animals.

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:38.610 align:middle line:90%
They love to work with animals.

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And she was struggling
in her relationships.

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:48.450 align:middle line:84%
She was always attracted
to narcissistic men.

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't
understand why she was

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:53.670 align:middle line:90%
falling into the same patterns.

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:55.740 align:middle line:90%
And so I did a reading for her.

00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, you're
from the Pleiades.

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And in the Pleiades,
relationships are very open.

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:07.440 align:middle line:84%
It's not uncommon for
Pleiadians on the Pleiades

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:13.900 align:middle line:84%
to have polyamorous
relationships.

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:19.600 align:middle line:84%
But they're also very, very
devoted in their relationships.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And because Pleiadian starseeds
tend to be very empathic

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:28.620 align:middle line:84%
and they see the
potential in everybody--

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:31.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it sounds like a
co-dependency type of thing--

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:34.020 align:middle line:90%
they take on these projects.

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:38.100 align:middle line:84%
They're like you know, oh wow,
I see the potential in this guy.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.150 align:middle line:90%
I really love him.

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:43.262 align:middle line:84%
And I think if I just worked
with him and helped him heal,

00:41:43.262 --> 00:41:44.220 align:middle line:90%
we'll be good together.

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: But it never
works out like that.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like
that in the Pleiades.

00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:51.090 align:middle line:84%
But when they come
here to Earth,

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:54.720 align:middle line:84%
they don't realize that,
hey, not everybody on Earth

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.260 align:middle line:84%
is like they are
in the Pleiades.

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:57.247 align:middle line:90%


00:41:57.247 --> 00:41:57.435 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:41:57.435 --> 00:41:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:41:59.850 align:middle line:90%
Different pool to choose from.

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:01.017 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:42:01.017 --> 00:42:04.827 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
particular client--

00:42:04.827 --> 00:42:07.160 align:middle line:84%
it was kind of like the light
bulb went off in her head.

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, I'm
going to change everything.

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:12.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to change everything.

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:15.230 align:middle line:84%
So now I think she's
embarking on some healthier

00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:16.260 align:middle line:90%
relationships.

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:18.440 align:middle line:84%
But what was
fascinating about her,

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.980 align:middle line:84%
too, is that she brought all
her kids in-- all her adult kids

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:23.000 align:middle line:90%
in for readings.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
were open to that.

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:24.710 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:25.430 align:middle line:90%
No, they were--

00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cool.

00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:26.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: I mean,
they came as a family.

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They probably
saw the changes in her.

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:30.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.163 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: And she made
some physical changes too.

00:42:32.163 --> 00:42:34.430 align:middle line:84%
I think she lost some weight,
took care of her health.

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, they
absolutely were open to it.

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And all her kids were from
different star systems,

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:42.780 align:middle line:90%
which was kind of fun.

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:44.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was a fun group.

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:44.266 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:42:44.266 --> 00:42:46.160 align:middle line:84%
So let's get to the
Reptilian clients.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.660 align:middle line:90%
What happened there?

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:51.020 align:middle line:84%
I do get a few
reptilian clients.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And is there a pattern to
what they struggle with?

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:53.910 align:middle line:90%


00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah,
there is, actually.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Reptilians are not
comfortable with expression--

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:05.810 align:middle line:84%
expressing of themselves
because they've

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:07.790 align:middle line:84%
gone through years
of evolution of being

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:10.790 align:middle line:84%
hunted down and killed,
especially here on Earth.

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:16.610 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of my Reptilian
clients usually

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:22.520 align:middle line:84%
want to keep their
sessions really private.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And this includes people
with Reptilian influences

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:31.910 align:middle line:84%
in their genetics, like the
Anunnaki-- that sort of thing.

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:33.442 align:middle line:84%
We can talk a whole
other topic on--

00:43:33.442 --> 00:43:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let me write that
down for our next conversation.

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:37.025 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, Anunnaki--

00:43:37.025 --> 00:43:38.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: That's a whole group.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, we can
go down many rabbit holes

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.190 align:middle line:90%
with that one.

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:44.023 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:43:44.023 --> 00:43:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: But usually, they
struggle with feeling accepted.

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And I know that sounds kind of
weird coming from Reptilians.

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:58.730 align:middle line:84%
but most of my reptilian
clients are more dragon caste.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:43:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: So there's a
gentler energy to them.

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:04.670 align:middle line:90%
They're not as warrior-like.

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:06.500 align:middle line:90%
They're not as aggressive.

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:09.590 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them come to
be teachers and healers.

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Reptilians are amongst
the most gifted healers

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:14.030 align:middle line:90%
that you'll ever find.

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:17.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like the
destructive capabilities that

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.640 align:middle line:84%
they have when they're on
their dark aspects turn

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.470 align:middle line:84%
into restorative
capabilities when they're--

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: When they go light.

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:31.040 align:middle line:84%
I actually have some clients
who have Reptilian guides.

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And they're the most
beautiful energy.

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:34.700 align:middle line:84%
They have this
beautiful green energy.

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:38.402 align:middle line:84%
It's just like you just want
to bathe in their greenness.

00:44:38.402 --> 00:44:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's so nice that
you're bringing that in--

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --because people
that know about that species

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.710 align:middle line:84%
tend to have so much
resistance and fear in general

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:46.430 align:middle line:90%
toward them.

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:47.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:50.210 align:middle line:84%
I personally don't
feel any ani--

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:53.750 align:middle line:84%
even though I perished
during the Lyran wars

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:57.740 align:middle line:84%
millions of years ago, I
could hold a real big grudge

00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.270 align:middle line:90%
against reptilians.

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:01.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't really hold a
grudge against them.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.440 align:middle line:90%
I see them as being like humans.

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.280 align:middle line:90%
There's good ones.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.360 align:middle line:90%
There's bad ones.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:08.300 align:middle line:84%
You just have to use
discernment when you know you're

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:09.870 align:middle line:90%
operating in the higher realms.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:13.805 align:middle line:84%
Maybe give us one more example
of a client from another place,

00:45:13.805 --> 00:45:15.680 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to
go to all these places

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:16.970 align:middle line:90%
in our next conversation.

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:19.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Sounds good.

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Let me check in on
a recent one I did.

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:25.620 align:middle line:90%


00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:28.830 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I had a client who--

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:30.875 align:middle line:84%
she actually been at a
lot of different places.

00:45:30.875 --> 00:45:33.450 align:middle line:90%


00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:35.730 align:middle line:90%
She started off in Lyra.

00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:38.410 align:middle line:84%
She had this twin
flame relationship.

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:41.640 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the videos
on my YouTube channel,

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:47.310 align:middle line:84%
so people that listen to
this or watch this show

00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:49.620 align:middle line:90%
can access her full story.

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.410 align:middle line:90%
But she had this--

00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:56.270 align:middle line:84%
she was holding a flame
for this twin flame.

00:45:56.270 --> 00:46:01.860 align:middle line:84%
She's holding a candle for him,
like for 30 years, because she

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:03.270 align:middle line:90%
felt like she had this--

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:05.890 align:middle line:90%


00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:08.105 align:middle line:90%
she had this contract with him.

00:46:08.105 --> 00:46:08.590 align:middle line:90%


00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is someone known
to her or not known to her?

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:11.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh no, she knew him.

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She knew this person.

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:13.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: They met in college.

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:16.420 align:middle line:90%
And they had this relationship.

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:18.520 align:middle line:84%
But he ended up
marrying somebody else.

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:20.230 align:middle line:90%
She married somebody else.

00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:22.560 align:middle line:90%
But they stayed in touch.

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:25.240 align:middle line:84%
But she was holding a
candle for this guy.

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And he was always kind
of stringing her along.

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was breaking her heart,
because she ended her marriage

00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:37.300 align:middle line:84%
and he ended his,
but he was still

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:39.490 align:middle line:90%
connected with the ex-wife.

00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:41.290 align:middle line:90%
And he was quite wealthy.

00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:43.390 align:middle line:90%
He was, I think, a CEO.

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:46.880 align:middle line:84%
He had quite a bit
of position of power.

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:53.290 align:middle line:10%
And what I saw in the records
with them was that he spent

00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:57.700 align:middle line:10%
lifetimes being a healer
on Earth, but he was poor.

00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:59.260 align:middle line:10%
He was destitute.

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:02.290 align:middle line:10%
And so in this lifetime,
he made a different choice.

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:05.950 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to experience
abundance and wealth.

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:10.240 align:middle line:84%
So he knew that if he went
back to his original old flame,

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.700 align:middle line:84%
he wasn't going to have that
abundance and wealth that he

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:13.930 align:middle line:90%
had with the ex-wife.

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
there's just so much.

00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:19.210 align:middle line:90%
It's fascinating, all of it.

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:21.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have so
much more to go over,

00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:24.730 align:middle line:84%
which we'll do in another hour
conversation at a later date.

00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:25.930 align:middle line:90%
We'll bring you back here.

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:26.185 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: OK.

00:47:26.185 --> 00:47:26.440 align:middle line:90%
Sounds good.

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:28.023 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I just
want to thank you

00:47:28.023 --> 00:47:30.670 align:middle line:84%
for your dedication to
chronicling things the way

00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:31.540 align:middle line:90%
you have.

00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Thank you.

00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:32.995 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I found your
site just wonderful.

00:47:32.995 --> 00:47:33.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Oh, thank you.

00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.572 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it has all
these fabulous graphics on it.

00:47:35.572 --> 00:47:37.932 align:middle line:84%
And you can go into the
back stories, some of which

00:47:37.932 --> 00:47:38.890 align:middle line:90%
we talked about today--

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SOLARIS: Yeah.

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.868 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and we
will be talking about.

00:47:40.868 --> 00:47:42.940 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, thank you for
the hard work you do.

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's just-- of course, to
me it's fun and fascinating--

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:48.550 align:middle line:84%
anything that gives us more
knowledge of who we are

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:50.860 align:middle line:84%
as a species and where
we might be going to--

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: And how it has an
impact on us personally too.

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:54.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how-- yes,
absolutely-- personally,

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.350 align:middle line:84%
as well Thank you
so much, Debbie.

00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SOLARIS: Thank you
for having me here.

00:47:57.490 --> 00:47:58.730 align:middle line:90%
It has been a real pleasure.

00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:01.190 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate your
interest in my work.

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:03.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:04.720 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating topic.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.370 align:middle line:10%
