00:00:27.552 --> 00:00:29.990 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: As religions
around the world struggle

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.040 align:middle line:10%
to find their bearings amidst
scandal, politically motivated

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.090 align:middle line:10%
violence, and loss
of their flocks,

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.210 align:middle line:10%
new religious thought continues
to rise to fill the void.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.050 align:middle line:84%
Much of the newer religions are
centered on the feminine's role

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.370 align:middle line:84%
in navigating through our
deep yearnings and questions.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Tricia McCannon was
raised Episcopalian

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.911 align:middle line:84%
and migrated to the mysteries,
founding the Phoenix Mystery

00:00:49.911 --> 00:00:50.410 align:middle line:90%
School.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.150 align:middle line:84%
She's with us today to
speak about her newest book,

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.779 align:middle line:84%
"The Return of the
Divine Sophia."

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I don't think
there's a "the" in there.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.960 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just "Return
of the Divine Sophia."

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>TRICIA MCCANNON:
But that's just fine.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.014 align:middle line:90%
That works, too, perfectly.

00:01:01.014 --> 00:01:03.781 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is one of
about 13 books, as I recall.

00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:04.489 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Yeah.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.900 align:middle line:90%
There are three published books.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.550 align:middle line:10%
Are we actually
going forward here?

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.200 align:middle line:10%
All right.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.910 align:middle line:10%
Well, yeah, I have
13 online books

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.590 align:middle line:10%
that are really all dedicated
to the mysteries and three

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.810 align:middle line:10%
that are published.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.110 align:middle line:10%
As you know, Dialogues
with the Angels,

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.370 align:middle line:10%
which kind of talks about the
awakening of my spiritual gifts

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.720 align:middle line:10%
as a child and how I began
to have these angelic beings

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.640 align:middle line:10%
come and teach me
and converse with me.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.610 align:middle line:84%
My last book was about the
lost years and secret teachings

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.940 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus, and that
was kind of a tour

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.580 align:middle line:84%
de force of learning about
the great spiritual mysteries.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Because Jesus, who I consider to
really be a master of masters,

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.480 align:middle line:84%
had been waited on by a lot
of these ancient traditions

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:90%
for over 500 years.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.010 align:middle line:90%
And they knew he was coming.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.730 align:middle line:84%
So that book was really
all about his journey

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.220 align:middle line:84%
through the mysteries
in the Celtic lands,

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.950 align:middle line:84%
the Essene lands,
in ancient Egypt,

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.280 align:middle line:84%
in India, of course, and
Persia and many other places.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And this book really
sort of picks up,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.720 align:middle line:84%
in many ways, where
the very first book,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.010 align:middle line:84%
the Dialogues with
Angels book, which

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.889 align:middle line:84%
was talking about my
personal experiences

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.230 align:middle line:84%
with masters and
angels, kind of ended.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.780 align:middle line:84%
So this book picks up when
I'm about 27 years old

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.187 align:middle line:84%
and I first encountered the
goddess teachings, which I--

00:02:17.187 --> 00:02:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.769 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get
into that in some detail.

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Now one thing about
your work in general

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.850 align:middle line:84%
is you distinguish between
theology and theurgy.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.554 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's good to just
set the stage explaining

00:02:28.554 --> 00:02:30.220 align:middle line:84%
the difference between
the two before we

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.680 align:middle line:84%
get into your beginning
of your goddess journey.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Yeah.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, theology is what
they study in seminary schools.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's a mental
conversation about god.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.170 align:middle line:84%
It is mental and it's talking
about the possibilities.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.450 align:middle line:84%
It's philosophy
related to the divine.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Theurgy is actually the direct
experience of the divine.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And for people who want to
stay in the masculine polarity

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.880 align:middle line:84%
or in their heads,
theology is kind of safe.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.520 align:middle line:84%
You can talk till
the cows come home

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.810 align:middle line:84%
and never really have
a real experience.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Theurgy is actually
the discourse,

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.350 align:middle line:84%
the divine discourse, that we
can have with divine beings

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.410 align:middle line:84%
that exist at the
higher realms--

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.750 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Jesus or Mary
Magdalen or Mary the Mother

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.070 align:middle line:84%
or, in other
traditions, of course it

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Pravidhi or Lakshmi
or Thoth or Isis

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle line:84%
or any of the divine
expressions that

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.480 align:middle line:84%
have come down and been
on this planet that

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.965 align:middle line:84%
actually still exist in the
higher dimensional realms.

00:03:32.965 --> 00:03:33.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.970 align:middle line:84%
That's a good,
clear explanation.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.710 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going
to back up a bit.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.450 align:middle line:84%
We'll go back to when you
were a young woman that

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.580 align:middle line:84%
wandered into a tchotchke
shop, met a woman,

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.280 align:middle line:84%
wandered into the forest, and
so the story starts from there.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Kind of a metaphysical
shop with beautiful things.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.800 align:middle line:90%
And you met this woman.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And we bring this
part of the story

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
up because this leads
directly into this book.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.035 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you write
about it in this book.

00:03:58.035 --> 00:03:58.743 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Yeah.

00:03:58.743 --> 00:04:00.890 align:middle line:84%
The book actually
begins with a dream.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And I've been very
active on the inner plane

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:04.780 align:middle line:90%
since I was a child.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And so that's sort
of the thing is

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.420 align:middle line:84%
I wind up having these powerful
inner plane experiences.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And like many people, I'm like,
well, what does this mean.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And then in the outside
world-- a month, a week,

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.470 align:middle line:84%
two months later-- it begins to
manifest in the physical level.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And if I hadn't had
the dream, I would not

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.330 align:middle line:84%
had the clues to be able to
follow what was happening.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.410 align:middle line:84%
So what happened in my case
was when I was about 27,

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.360 align:middle line:90%
I live in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm a commercial
advertising photographer.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.980 align:middle line:84%
I've no thought of being a
spiritual teacher or anything.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
But I am following
my own spiritual path

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.550 align:middle line:84%
where I'm studying
with these masters that

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.330 align:middle line:84%
work on the inner planes--
the vairagi masters that I

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.945 align:middle line:90%
talk about in my other books.

00:04:45.945 --> 00:04:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And I have this dream that
I've gone back to school

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.700 align:middle line:90%
for my master's degree.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And I wake up in
the dormitory room

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and there's all this sort
of vertical extraterrestrial

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.450 align:middle line:84%
writing on the wall, kind of
like Egyptian hieroglyphics,

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.670 align:middle line:90%
but different.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And I knew it was
the language of light

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.860 align:middle line:84%
or the language of the angels,
although how I knew that,

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.250 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And I kept trying to
memorize the symbols,

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.130 align:middle line:90%
but I fell back asleep.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And when I woke up,
the writing was gone.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And I could only
remember one, which

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.280 align:middle line:84%
was a circle with a
dot at the center.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to
the library to see

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.660 align:middle line:84%
if I could find some
reference to this symbol.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.552 align:middle line:84%
And when I was there,
the student assistant

00:05:24.552 --> 00:05:26.260 align:middle line:84%
came and got me and
said there is a phone

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.870 align:middle line:90%
call for you at the front desk.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, well, how could
there be a phone call for me?

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.930 align:middle line:90%
Nobody even knows I'm here.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is all in
dream time, still, by the way?

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.696 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: All
in the dream time.

00:05:35.696 --> 00:05:39.727 align:middle line:84%
So I go to the front desk and
pick up the phone to say, yes?

00:05:39.727 --> 00:05:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And they say, is
this Tricia McCannon?

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.020 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes, can I help you?

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And they say, we've
called to tell you

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.300 align:middle line:90%
that your dreams are real.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.680 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, what?

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.500 align:middle line:90%
Who is this?

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.320 align:middle line:84%
And they said we're from
the priestesses of Isis

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.010 align:middle line:84%
and that's all we're permitted
to tell you at this time.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And then the woman
hung up the phone.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.470 align:middle line:90%
And then I woke up.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it was
a dream within a dream.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And there were two
clues-- the symbol

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.490 align:middle line:90%
and the priestesses of Isis.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.380 align:middle line:84%
But like anybody,
it was like, well,

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.320 align:middle line:84%
who the heck are the
priestesses of Isis?

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Some strange Egyptian
cult or something?

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.570 align:middle line:84%
So then we pick up with the
visit to this beautiful store

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:16.800 align:middle line:90%
called Illumina.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Two months later, I
walk into this store

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.190 align:middle line:84%
at one of my lunch
hours and I'm looking

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.990 align:middle line:84%
at this beautiful
Egyptian statue.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And the woman behind
the counter says,

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.920 align:middle line:84%
are you interested
in Egyptian things?

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And I sort of mumbled
something like, yeah, I've

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.390 align:middle line:84%
been dreaming of the
priestesses of Isis.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And she says, oh,
tell me your dreams.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.920 align:middle line:90%
And I turned around.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And this was actually to become
my spiritual teacher, Shasta.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I'm
not sure you'd really

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.670 align:middle line:90%
understand my dreams.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:48.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure I do.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.050 align:middle line:90%
And she said, try me.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm a high initiate in
the priestesses of Isis.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's really how this book
begins in the first five pages.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I accepted an
invitation to go and visit her.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And she lived in this
very secluded area close

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.750 align:middle line:84%
to Atlanta-- in
Atlanta, actually--

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.150 align:middle line:84%
that was a sacred
vortex where women

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.360 align:middle line:84%
had been coming, as she said,
for over 10,000 years to pray.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And there were
shrines and statues

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and grottoes and alcoves
to the divine mother

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.467 align:middle line:90%
and all of her many forms.

00:07:22.467 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:90%
And this was--

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.716 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I loved
that part of the book,

00:07:24.716 --> 00:07:28.330 align:middle line:84%
because it was like going
into Sleeping Beauty's cottage

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.520 align:middle line:90%
in the woods or something.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:90%
It was very archetypal.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.660 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: It's true.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.690 align:middle line:84%
That's how it felt.
In fact, when I first

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.410 align:middle line:84%
drove up to her house, I
couldn't even see her house.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.927 align:middle line:84%
It was like there was a
glamor over the house.

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, do I
have the right address?

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And so then I go up
to her little porch

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:50.762 align:middle line:84%
with cow skulls and deer
skins and dream catchers--

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:51.595 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And bones.

00:07:51.595 --> 00:07:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: Bones and
crystals and shells.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking I'm in a Hans
Christian Andersen fairy tale.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:59.600 align:middle line:90%
And I knock on the door.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.810 align:middle line:84%
It has a little
wooden heart doorbell.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And she took me into
her simple little house

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.700 align:middle line:84%
that had four rooms,
like a cross really.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So the left was her living
room that had nothing in it

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:14.200 align:middle line:84%
except a fireplace and
four altars to the goddess.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure my eyes were as
big as saucers at that time

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.200 align:middle line:84%
because this was so far outside
of my realm of knowledge.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And I remember she had 11
white cats in her kitchen.

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, she'd fix
us catnip or dandelion tea.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never even heard
of catnip tea before.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And she made it fresh
from catnip in her garden.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.669 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how doers
catnip tea effect you?

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: Well,
I have no idea,

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.079 align:middle line:90%
because I chose the dandelion.

00:08:39.079 --> 00:08:40.789 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:41.289 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
you didn't mention

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.103 align:middle line:90%
in the book which one you chose.

00:08:44.103 --> 00:08:45.270 align:middle line:90%
I meant to ask you that.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:46.936 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: Well, you
know, I was really

00:08:46.936 --> 00:08:49.010 align:middle line:84%
looking for the excuse
to be able to soak

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.160 align:middle line:84%
in the energies of
this magical place

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.400 align:middle line:84%
by myself without
being so obvious

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.140 align:middle line:84%
that I was looking around
with such big, wide eyes.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked if I
could use the restroom.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And I went back to
her restroom and when

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.240 align:middle line:84%
I walked into the
room, those Egyptian,

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.070 align:middle line:84%
those symbols that I had seen
in my dream, were on her walls.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And I felt as if the
bathroom was watching me.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.010 align:middle line:84%
I know that sounds very strange,
but there was a very highly

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.190 align:middle line:90%
intelligent presence there.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.470 align:middle line:90%
And it was sussing me out.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:25.037 align:middle line:84%
And so when I went back
to see her, I said,

00:09:25.037 --> 00:09:26.870 align:middle line:84%
that's a very interesting
bathroom you have.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.030 align:middle line:90%
It was watching me.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yeah, I
thought you would like it.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And she went on to explain
that where she lived

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.720 align:middle line:84%
was the intersection of
two blind springs which

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.732 align:middle line:84%
are underground
concourses of water where

00:09:39.732 --> 00:09:42.690 align:middle line:84%
the intelligence of the
water, the information all

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.140 align:middle line:90%
over the planet, travels.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And they would probably be
connected to great ley lines

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and that this had
been a huge vortex.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And so she took me
down into her garden.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And actually as she began
to talk about the water,

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.860 align:middle line:84%
she spoke about the
intelligence of something

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.660 align:middle line:90%
she called River Woman.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Now who's River Woman?

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.460 align:middle line:84%
But she talked about how
in the ancient world,

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.480 align:middle line:84%
women would go and sit
by the river and listen

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and this way they could get
the news from upstream way

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.660 align:middle line:84%
before the runners ever
came to the village.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Because, as we've discovered
with Masaru Emoto,

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.950 align:middle line:84%
his incredible work
with water, water

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.700 align:middle line:90%
seems to have intelligence.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.650 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be something
that hears our words,

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.840 align:middle line:84%
hears our intentions,
hears music,

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.750 align:middle line:84%
and that is coherent
in its structure

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.750 align:middle line:84%
until we do something
like play heavy metal

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.140 align:middle line:90%
or desecrate it in some way.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And so it was
living intelligence.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And of course this is
all over 30 years ago.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:44.030 align:middle line:84%
So none of this incredible work
that other researchers have

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.390 align:middle line:84%
done to support this
scientifically had come out.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:50.060 align:middle line:84%
But somehow her words, even
though it was far outside

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.500 align:middle line:84%
of my paradigm,
made sense to me.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And when we wound up going
down into the garden,

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.370 align:middle line:84%
I spent the afternoon
with her that day

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.100 align:middle line:84%
and the things she
said to me, Regina,

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.810 align:middle line:84%
they just completely
shifted my reality.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to
imagine that you

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:09.670 align:middle line:84%
could spend four hours with
someone in that kind of place

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and have such a profound
shift of consciousness.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:17.520 align:middle line:84%
But she explained to me
that some very simple things

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.780 align:middle line:84%
that we don't know
in our society.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.900 align:middle line:84%
For example, all mammals are
created biologically female.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.640 align:middle line:84%
The existence of the
male is the release

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.852 align:middle line:84%
of an additional androgen.
Now that might not

00:11:29.852 --> 00:11:31.310 align:middle line:84%
seem very important
to many people,

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.010 align:middle line:84%
but when you think
about the fact

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.440 align:middle line:84%
that the Judeo-Christian
religions have all taught us

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.650 align:middle line:84%
that man was
created first, women

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:43.600 align:middle line:84%
is a subset of man taken
from the rib of a man,

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and therefore this has justified
the subjugation of women

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.710 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.910 align:middle line:84%
We're here to basically be
the servants, the slaves,

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:84%
the wives, the mother, and
serve the man's agenda--

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.719 align:middle line:84%
understanding that actually
we're all created female first

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:00.260 align:middle line:90%
is important.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.009 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, explain
that a little bit.

00:12:02.009 --> 00:12:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Because when it comes
to human reproduction,

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:08.230 align:middle line:84%
at the point of conception,
the sex is already determined.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:13.100 align:middle line:84%
So where in that, for
example with humans,

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.835 align:middle line:84%
are you saying we're
starting out as female first?

00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:18.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: I'm saying that
there are biologists like Mary

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Schefferdy-- and I actually
quote these sources

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.170 align:middle line:84%
in my book-- that
are geneticists,

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:29.180 align:middle line:84%
that have discovered that
all mammals, whether human

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.470 align:middle line:84%
or animal, are actually
created female first.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And that the
existence of the male

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.970 align:middle line:84%
is due to the release of
an additional androgen that

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:44.760 align:middle line:84%
allows that extra chromosome,
the xy chromosome,

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.750 align:middle line:90%
to actually form.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So even
if it's determined

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.370 align:middle line:84%
at the point of
conception, you're

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.690 align:middle line:84%
saying it doesn't
actually express itself

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:54.422 align:middle line:84%
until a little bit
later in the process.

00:12:54.422 --> 00:12:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: What biologists--

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
you're basing it on.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Yeah.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:58.360 align:middle line:90%
And genetics.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And why this matters is
only because the world has

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.950 align:middle line:84%
been based on a
social system that

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.090 align:middle line:84%
has grown out of a
theology that has made one

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.660 align:middle line:90%
gender superior to the other.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.530 align:middle line:84%
This is the only
reason this matters.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:17.070 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if our belief
that men should be dominant

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:22.747 align:middle line:84%
and women are subsets of men
is what the theologies have

00:13:22.747 --> 00:13:25.250 align:middle line:84%
been based on-- Eve ate
the apple before men,

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.040 align:middle line:90%
therefore women should suffer.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And now you may not
have this belief,

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.030 align:middle line:84%
but there are many,
many people that have

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.210 align:middle line:90%
been taught this in the Bible.

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And this gets into a very
big conversation when

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:38.870 align:middle line:90%
you start looking at theology.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And in The Return of
the Divine Sophia,

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.800 align:middle line:84%
there is not only this kind of
amazing shamanic story going

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.160 align:middle line:84%
on, but because these
concepts were very new to me--

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.172 align:middle line:84%
I had been, like everyone
else, raised in a society--

00:13:53.172 --> 00:13:55.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I never
bought the rib of Adam thing.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Right.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.970 align:middle line:84%
So I actually wound up
going into a very deep

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:05.030 align:middle line:84%
historical, archaeological,
anthropological research

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:07.730 align:middle line:90%
to discover what was true.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Because my dad was a
lawyer, as you know.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.380 align:middle line:84%
So even though I'm a
mystic, I'm very grounded

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.160 align:middle line:90%
and very research-oriented.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And so in the book
I actually take on,

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:90%
for example, the Old Testament.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Now that sounds like
a crazy thing to do,

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.610 align:middle line:84%
but in my own
integration process

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:30.110 align:middle line:84%
of understanding how the
divine feminine existed,

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.550 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that,
for example, that god

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:36.130 align:middle line:84%
was worshiped as the
divine mother for almost

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:40.270 align:middle line:84%
the first 200,000 years that
Homo sapien sapien was around.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:41.140 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know this.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.800 align:middle line:84%
I've been taught that god was a
male with a long white beard up

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.100 align:middle line:84%
there on a cloud,
judging everybody

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.670 align:middle line:90%
with hellfire and damnation.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:52.820 align:middle line:84%
My dad was Baptist, so for
the first eight or nine years

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.060 align:middle line:84%
I was alive, we went to the
hellfire and damnation church.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And then it was like, well, this
really wasn't working for us.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And so we then wound up
going to the Methodist

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.430 align:middle line:84%
and the Presbyterian,
and finally found

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:07.180 align:middle line:84%
this beautiful little
Episcopalian parish,

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.460 align:middle line:84%
which I loved that because
they had all the best things.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.352 align:middle line:84%
They had the wafting incense
and the genuflecting.

00:15:13.352 --> 00:15:14.560 align:middle line:90%
And you could cross yourself.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.770 align:middle line:84%
All the beautiful rituals,
but with no guilt or blame

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:18.700 align:middle line:90%
or shame.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
this is just wonderful.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.470 align:middle line:90%
Catholic light, you know?

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's go back to
the Old Testament a bit.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Because as you point out in
the book, the first 1,000 years

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.170 align:middle line:84%
or so, the religion,
the Hebrew religion,

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.570 align:middle line:84%
was not monotheistic,
A, and they

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:43.647 align:middle line:84%
did honor the divine
feminine very profoundly

00:15:43.647 --> 00:15:44.730 align:middle line:90%
as part of their practice.

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: They did.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.013 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so let's talk
about what happened compared

00:15:48.013 --> 00:15:51.090 align:middle line:84%
to the Old Testament we
all read in Sunday school

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and then the transition of how
the feminine was essentially

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:57.760 align:middle line:84%
eliminated from the power
base of the spirit world.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: Well,
what I discovered

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.500 align:middle line:84%
is through the work of
Marija, an archaeologist

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.430 align:middle line:84%
called Marija Gimbutas,
who in the 19th--

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:08.820 align:middle line:84%
she was from Lithuania,
so her grandmother kind of

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.964 align:middle line:84%
taught her a lot of the
symbols of the goddess,

00:16:10.964 --> 00:16:13.380 align:middle line:84%
because Christianity didn't
come into Lithuania until 1400

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.030 align:middle line:90%
or 1500s.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:18.520 align:middle line:84%
So when she began studying, she
became a teacher and a fellow

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.700 align:middle line:84%
at Harvard University
for 12 years.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And then later
she spent 15 years

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:26.590 align:middle line:84%
conducting research in
Turkey, Yugoslavia, Greece,

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:27.810 align:middle line:90%
the whole Mediterranean.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And she began unearthing
this sacred language

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.320 align:middle line:90%
that she could read.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Not only was she proficient
in 11 different languages--

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.280 align:middle line:84%
she was quite incredible--
but she was really

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.410 align:middle line:84%
a mythologist or a
symbologist, much as I am,

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.650 align:middle line:84%
but she did it
through the academia.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:44.510 align:middle line:84%
So she had the
capacity to understand

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.130 align:middle line:84%
what these symbols
meant and they

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:50.170 align:middle line:84%
began to discover all
these Venus figurines,

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:54.580 align:middle line:84%
like the Willendorf goddess
that goes back 40,000 years.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.860 align:middle line:84%
The Acheulian goddess,
that goes back 200--

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.250 align:middle line:90%
a minimum of 230,000 years.

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 208,000,
anywhere in that range.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Unbelievable.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.780 align:middle line:84%
So of course what happened
with our early ancestors is

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.300 align:middle line:84%
they could observe that
who gave birth were women.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.740 align:middle line:84%
So who would have
birthed the universe?

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.510 align:middle line:90%
The divine mother.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.650 align:middle line:84%
That's why the Milky Way
is called the Milky Way.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:18.280 align:middle line:90%
It's the mother's milk.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.040 align:middle line:84%
So she began to
write about this.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.099 align:middle line:84%
And she went on to write five or
six very highly respected books

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:28.099 align:middle line:84%
about the discovery of
matristic societies.

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:30.277 align:middle line:84%
Now these are not matriarchal,
like patriarchical--

00:17:30.277 --> 00:17:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain the
difference between matristic

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.440 align:middle line:90%
and matriarchal.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.600 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Perfect.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Patriarchal systems are
suppressive to women

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.820 align:middle line:90%
and they are hierarchical.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And they deal primarily with the
left side of the brain, which

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:49.621 align:middle line:84%
is logic, fact, and forget
intuition, feelings, mysticism.

00:17:49.621 --> 00:17:50.120 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.210 align:middle line:90%
That's the patriarchy.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Matriarchal, we would assume
would kind of be the reverse.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:59.560 align:middle line:84%
It would be much more
the women are in charge,

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.950 align:middle line:90%
men are suppressed.

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:03.360 align:middle line:84%
These are call
matristic societies

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.940 align:middle line:84%
because they were
partnership model societies.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:11.070 align:middle line:84%
Usually the woman was the
high queen, the high priestess

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:12.020 align:middle line:90%
and the queen.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And the line of succession
passed through the woman.

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So it was her daughter
that took the throne.

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:22.150 align:middle line:84%
So she would rule with her
brother or with her husband.

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:23.610 align:middle line:90%
So men had their power.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:24.560 align:middle line:90%
They had their place.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.170 align:middle line:90%
They protected the community.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.030 align:middle line:84%
They were involved
in instructing

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:30.970 align:middle line:90%
the next generation of people.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So it was not up with
women, down with men,

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:37.120 align:middle line:84%
as it has been in the
patriarchal world.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.450 align:middle line:90%
It was a partnership model.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And what they've discovered
about these societies

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.560 align:middle line:90%
is there was no war.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:47.430 align:middle line:84%
Up until about 4,000 BC, they
didn't have fortifications.

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:49.950 align:middle line:84%
They used their weapons
only for hunting.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And so we lived in peace
with the environment.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And life was seen as
a sacred experience.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.430 align:middle line:90%
Life, death, and rebirth.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.550 align:middle line:84%
It was all in this-- they
understood reincarnation.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:06.630 align:middle line:84%
They understood that
all things are a season.

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And when the patriarchy
came in, very slowly,

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.990 align:middle line:84%
reincarnation was taken
out of Christian teachings.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I was
going to say, essentially,

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:19.000 align:middle line:84%
other than Christianity,
most religions

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.560 align:middle line:84%
embraced reincarnation
historically.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.393 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Exactly.

00:19:21.393 --> 00:19:24.100 align:middle line:90%
And in fact, Judaism did.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And Christianity did
until 500 or 600,

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:34.820 align:middle line:84%
where it was actually illegally
taken out of the Catholic canon

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.365 align:middle line:84%
and later it was declared
that was illegal--

00:19:37.365 --> 00:19:40.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was that Augustine
or was it Constantine?

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:41.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: It was further.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:43.100 align:middle line:90%
It was further on.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.440 align:middle line:84%
I actually have all
this in the book.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.090 align:middle line:90%
I track it.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm bad with some of
those dates myself.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:48.390 align:middle line:90%
But it was taken out.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:49.340 align:middle line:90%
The point is, it was removed.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.131 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: It was.

00:19:50.131 --> 00:19:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And so when that happens,
what happens is we have birth.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.410 align:middle line:90%
We have life.

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:56.340 align:middle line:90%
We have death.

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.820 align:middle line:84%
So now we're sort of obsessed
with death and killing.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:01.820 align:middle line:90%
We're obsessed with war.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And the whole
patriarchy, it's shifted.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:09.590 align:middle line:84%
If we really truly realize
that we sow what we reap

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and that whatever systems
we're setting up now,

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.550 align:middle line:84%
when we reincarnate 100 years
from now or 200 years ago,

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.610 align:middle line:84%
we have to inherit the damage
we're doing to the earth.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So do you believe that
the removal of reincarnation

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:25.340 align:middle line:84%
from the doctrine
is what helped move

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:27.295 align:middle line:90%
along the patriarchal structure?

00:20:27.295 --> 00:20:28.371 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: I do.

00:20:28.371 --> 00:20:28.870 align:middle line:90%
I so.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because of
that lack of continuity

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:32.805 align:middle line:90%
and self-responsibility.

00:20:32.805 --> 00:20:33.555 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Right.

00:20:33.555 --> 00:20:35.513 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that which
of course would create

00:20:35.513 --> 00:20:37.117 align:middle line:90%
fear of your own mortality.

00:20:37.117 --> 00:20:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Exactly.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which then you need
intermediaries on your behalf.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: It's so true.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:44.730 align:middle line:90%
It's logical.

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:47.700 align:middle line:84%
I think the Church
thought if they say, look,

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.074 align:middle line:84%
there are many opportunities
to become enlightened.

00:20:50.074 --> 00:20:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully you'll
get it this time,

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:55.230 align:middle line:84%
but if you don't, maybe
you'll do better next time.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.090 align:middle line:84%
If they take that
away, instead they

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.310 align:middle line:90%
say, look, you have one life.

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:01.980 align:middle line:84%
You either join us or
you're excommunicated

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.371 align:middle line:84%
and you're damned to
hell for all eternity.

00:21:04.371 --> 00:21:05.120 align:middle line:90%
You've got heaven.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:05.786 align:middle line:90%
You've got hell.

00:21:05.786 --> 00:21:07.280 align:middle line:90%
We're the doorway to heaven.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.310 align:middle line:90%
Come join the Church.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:09.380 align:middle line:90%
Give us lots of money.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm picking on the
Church, but it's really

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.269 align:middle line:84%
all of the
Judeo-Christian-- they

00:21:14.269 --> 00:21:16.060 align:middle line:84%
call themselves the
monotheistic religions,

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.510 align:middle line:90%
but to me it's dualistic.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Because what they've
done is they've

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.180 align:middle line:84%
created this Satan figure
or the devil figure

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.470 align:middle line:84%
and tried to scare the
bejeebers out of people to say,

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:29.900 align:middle line:84%
you know, our way or
fear, shame, blame, guilt,

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.030 align:middle line:90%
and ultimately hell.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
aside from Satan,

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Yahweh himself,
"himself", was quite

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.565 align:middle line:90%
a judgmental and brutal god.

00:21:38.565 --> 00:21:40.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: You have
got it perfectly.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.705 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is one
thing Carl Jung said.

00:21:42.705 --> 00:21:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who needs
Satan if you have Yahweh?

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm just joking, but--

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: I know exactly.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure there are
many amazingly wonderful

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:53.140 align:middle line:84%
spiritual people in the Jewish
community that, when they think

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.760 align:middle line:84%
of Yahweh, they really
think of God with a big G.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.580 align:middle line:90%
And so this is really important.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Just as there are many millions
of wonderful Christians

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.490 align:middle line:84%
that, even though
they may be limited

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.490 align:middle line:84%
by their understanding
of the dogma

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:08.580 align:middle line:84%
that they inherited
from their churches,

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.080 align:middle line:84%
their hearts are
in the right place,

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.840 align:middle line:84%
they're trying to do
all the right things.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:12.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People
are still people.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.530 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
the structures

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.942 align:middle line:84%
and what has been perpetuated
by way of structures.

00:22:16.942 --> 00:22:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Yes.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.540 align:middle line:84%
So when you ask about
the Old Testament,

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.760 align:middle line:84%
if you can imagine rolling
up my sleeves to take

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.850 align:middle line:84%
on the Old Testament--
heaven forbid--

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:29.510 align:middle line:84%
but what I discovered, to my
utter and complete amazement,

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:31.390 align:middle line:84%
is that the five
books of Moses weren't

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:33.300 align:middle line:90%
written by Moses at all.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:34.340 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.300 align:middle line:84%
The five books of
Moses are the Torah.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.270 align:middle line:84%
That's back to the
Jewish teachings.

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:41.540 align:middle line:84%
This is the beginning
of the Islamic Qur'an.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we've
inherited it in Christianity.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.210 align:middle line:84%
The five books of Moses,
they figure 40% to 60%

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:52.650 align:middle line:84%
were written 300 to 500
years after the events.

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And the other 40%
to 60% were written

00:22:55.220 --> 00:23:00.910 align:middle line:84%
between 100 AD and maybe
400 or 500-- no, I'm sorry.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.480 align:middle line:90%
100 BC to about 500 BC.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:07.240 align:middle line:84%
So I of course had
been told the idea is

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:12.140 align:middle line:84%
that god created man and
woman, then Abraham came along,

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.690 align:middle line:84%
then Moses came
along, and now we're

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:17.270 align:middle line:84%
listening to god's commandments
and we better get in the box

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:18.630 align:middle line:90%
or we'll be punished.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And so that's kind of the
Old Testament version of--

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.390 align:middle line:84%
and Yahweh actually says to
those poor Hebrew people,

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:28.140 align:middle line:84%
if you do not do what I
say, I will hunt you down

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.340 align:middle line:90%
to the last person.

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.220 align:middle line:90%
I will kill you.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.690 align:middle line:90%
I will curse your descendants.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:33.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lots of blood.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.300 align:middle line:90%
Lots of blood.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: It's
really kind of scary.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:41.440 align:middle line:84%
So we have to ask them, for
one, if Yahweh was really

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.930 align:middle line:84%
maybe like a very big
powerful extraterrestrial god.

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:47.610 align:middle line:84%
That's possible, because
Yahweh's other name

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:48.900 align:middle line:90%
was Jehovah.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.980 align:middle line:90%
And Jehovah's wife was Asherah.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, Jove and Hera are the
Greek gods, aren't they?

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:57.352 align:middle line:90%
Jove and Hera.

00:23:57.352 --> 00:23:58.060 align:middle line:90%
Jehovah, Asherah.

00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.550 align:middle line:90%
It certainly makes sense.

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:02.025 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the symbols
are exactly the same.

00:24:02.025 --> 00:24:05.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And depending
on who you're reading,

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:08.480 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrial story
does start seeping into it.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: It does.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
long-lived Annunaki gods.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:14.630 align:middle line:90%
And we've spoken of them before.

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:17.100 align:middle line:84%
But what I would have
to say about them

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.332 align:middle line:84%
is that they were
world civilizers.

00:24:19.332 --> 00:24:21.040 align:middle line:84%
They came to this
planet because they had

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.740 align:middle line:90%
a problem with their own ozone.

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.490 align:middle line:84%
They were mining gold in
order to solve a problem.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:30.800 align:middle line:84%
But it forced them to be down
here for about 438,000 years.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.420 align:middle line:84%
They began to remove
themselves from human affairs

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:37.690 align:middle line:90%
around maybe 1800, 2000 BC.

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And then many of them left
full on around 500 BC.

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And so by the time we have
the story of Moses coming now

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:51.880 align:middle line:84%
having one of these gods
pick him up by the collar

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.640 align:middle line:84%
and say, listen, I
got a job for you

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.200 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like you to get this
group of people out of Egypt.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to kind of run
you around the desert for 40

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:01.860 align:middle line:84%
days and 40 nights, or
40 years as the case

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.150 align:middle line:84%
may be-- whether that was
actually 40 years or just

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:07.620 align:middle line:84%
a term in the Bible,
basically it's

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:11.790 align:middle line:84%
kind of like I'm going to shape
you up through two or three

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:14.690 align:middle line:84%
generations so I'm the only
one that you're listening to.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.320 align:middle line:84%
40 years is about
two generations.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And so when we start talking
about Jehovah and all of this,

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:27.550 align:middle line:84%
it becomes a very big question
as to whether or not Jehovah--

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who the
being actually was.

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: Who the
being really was.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Now he could have been
in the Annunaki pantheon.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.590 align:middle line:84%
He very well could
have been Ninurta.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Because Ninurta was the
oldest son of the one that

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.220 align:middle line:84%
was in command of
the whole earth

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:45.430 align:middle line:84%
and he had been told that
he would inherit the earth.

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:49.231 align:middle line:84%
And the one that was
in charge was Enlil.

00:25:49.231 --> 00:25:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And of course, there was a whole
other side to the Annunaki.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:55.130 align:middle line:84%
They were much more enlightened
and much more Christ-oriented.

00:25:55.130 --> 00:26:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And that was the Isis and Thoth
and Horus and Enki and Osiris.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And those beings
were really concerned

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:06.460 align:middle line:84%
about awakening, the spiritual
awakening of humanity.

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.080 align:middle line:84%
The raising of
our consciousness.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.955 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The brother's had an
argument from the beginning.

00:26:09.955 --> 00:26:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Right.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.860 align:middle line:84%
So one saw us as
a workforce, one

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.480 align:middle line:84%
saw us as having the same
divine spark within us

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.290 align:middle line:90%
that they have in them.

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:20.340 align:middle line:90%
And so who was in charge?

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:23.480 align:middle line:84%
So I think when the
gods were basically

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.980 align:middle line:84%
begin to pull back from
human affairs very actively

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.570 align:middle line:84%
around 2100 BC,
I think that this

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:34.000 align:middle line:84%
might have been the last ditch
effort from Ninurta to say,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.390 align:middle line:84%
look, I was promised
dominion of the earth.

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:41.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go get the
people in Egypt-- of course,

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:43.450 align:middle line:90%
Egypt was the rival country.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Africa, Egypt was all
Enki and his children.

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:49.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting this
group out and I'm

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:54.330 align:middle line:84%
going to whip them into shape as
an army and they'll be my tool.

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:57.180 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure some of those
people didn't like that at all.

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.221 align:middle line:84%
And some of them were
like, well, what can we do?

00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:01.810 align:middle line:84%
There's a big space ship parked
over us with a huge light

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:05.070 align:middle line:84%
down here and it does seem to
have a lot of power, and so OK.

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:07.550 align:middle line:90%
We'll go along with the program.

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:09.480 align:middle line:84%
But in the beginning
what I discovered

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:14.220 align:middle line:84%
was that in the time of
King Solomon and King David,

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.810 align:middle line:84%
the divine father and
mother were honored

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:20.190 align:middle line:84%
and the divine daughter
and son were honored

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.680 align:middle line:90%
for centuries and centuries.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.780 align:middle line:84%
But the priests of Yahweh
really didn't like that set up.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.860 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to be
the one and only.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:32.080 align:middle line:84%
So they kept suppressing the
divine mother, the divine son,

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.030 align:middle line:90%
and the divine daughter.

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like we're
the only ones in charge.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And so by the time the
Assyrians took down Sumeria--

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:48.720 align:middle line:84%
not Sumeria-- Sumeria, the
northern kingdom around 722 BC.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And those were, of the
12 tribes of Israel,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.630 align:middle line:90%
those were 10 of the tribes.

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:56.310 align:middle line:84%
The Judea, the southern
section, did not even

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:58.420 align:middle line:84%
lift their finger to
help their brothers.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:58.920 align:middle line:90%
Nope.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:27:59.710 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, they later said,
well-- the priest of Yahweh

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:04.950 align:middle line:84%
said-- the reason
they got taken down

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.670 align:middle line:84%
is because they were still
honoring the divine feminine.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.200 align:middle line:90%
So they blamed it on that.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.010 align:middle line:84%
So they kept trying
to get the upper hand.

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Judea was taken down, the
southern kingdom, around 570

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:18.260 align:middle line:90%
BC.

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:21.110 align:middle line:84%
So for 50 years, they
went over to Babylon.

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And so when the Persians
conquered Babylon

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:29.230 align:middle line:84%
around 518 or 522 BC,
they released everybody

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:30.340 align:middle line:90%
from captivity.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:34.220 align:middle line:84%
2/3 of the Jews chose
to stay in Babylon.

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.150 align:middle line:90%
But 1/3 moved back.

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And the Persians underwrote the
building of roads and cities.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.580 align:middle line:84%
But the Persians, by this
time, were very patriarchal

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.850 align:middle line:90%
themselves, very dominating.

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And so it gave the priests of
Yahweh the perfect leverage.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:54.220 align:middle line:84%
They were maybe, they figured,
about 3% of the population

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:55.800 align:middle line:90%
could actually read and write.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.900 align:middle line:84%
So the priests of Yahweh
got the upper hand.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is when, in
Biblical scholarship,

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.230 align:middle line:84%
they've divided all of the
information, the Old Testament,

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:09.750 align:middle line:84%
basically in four groups-- what
they call the J group, Jehovah,

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:11.880 align:middle line:84%
the E group, the
Elohim, which would

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.490 align:middle line:90%
have been the gods, plural.

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And those were things
that were written probably

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.680 align:middle line:84%
from 12, 11, 10,
to the time of King

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:23.930 align:middle line:90%
Solomon in 950 BC, that group.

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And then the others are
the P group for priestly

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:30.280 align:middle line:84%
and the D group
for Deuteronomist,

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.650 align:middle line:84%
which means basically it's
all about dogma, laws, taxes,

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:36.360 align:middle line:90%
obeisance and so forth.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.790 align:middle line:84%
This had nothing
mystical in it at all.

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:42.200 align:middle line:84%
It was all just you will
obey and these are the rules.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:48.125 align:middle line:84%
And those books were created
from about 520 or 518

00:29:48.125 --> 00:29:50.430 align:middle line:90%
to about 100 BC.

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:52.570 align:middle line:84%
So what we know of
as the Old Testament

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:57.420 align:middle line:84%
was not codified into
canon until about 100 BC.

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And this, of course,
was a shock to me.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.050 align:middle line:10%
And when I discovered that
Moses never even wrote

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:05.700 align:middle line:10%
the five books of the Bible,
those first five books,

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.210 align:middle line:10%
that kind of blew my mind.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Because that would be like me
writing about Thomas Jefferson

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.040 align:middle line:84%
250 years ago or
even further back,

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Columbus, when I didn't
even know Columbus.

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:20.690 align:middle line:90%
I just had stories of Columbus.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:23.260 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
literary license, I think,

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.460 align:middle line:84%
that was taken
with it to further

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:28.357 align:middle line:84%
the agenda of that
patriarchal group.

00:30:28.357 --> 00:30:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, they took
away all the rights from women.

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.760 align:middle line:90%
Women could not own property.

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.670 align:middle line:90%
Women could not have jobs.

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:39.430 align:middle line:84%
If a woman was raped--
by a man, by the way--

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:41.390 align:middle line:84%
she either had to
marry the rapist

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:43.520 align:middle line:84%
or she was stoned
to death and killed.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:48.160 align:middle line:84%
If an engaged woman or a married
woman was raped, not a virgin,

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.260 align:middle line:84%
she was stoned or killed,
because after all, she

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.320 align:middle line:90%
had been defiled.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Never mind that the
man never got punished.

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:54.910 align:middle line:90%
It was the woman.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Men could give a writ
of paper to their wife

00:30:58.030 --> 00:30:59.280 align:middle line:90%
to say I'm divorcing you.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.060 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Women could never choose
to divorce their husbands.

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And when you really begin
to read about the things

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:09.970 align:middle line:84%
that, whether they were real or
whether the priests of Yahweh

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:13.870 align:middle line:84%
just made them up, it's
like, go into these cities

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and kill every man, woman,
chicken, pig, and goat,

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:17.630 align:middle line:90%
except for the virgins.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:20.420 align:middle line:84%
You can rape them and take
them back as sex slaves.

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.840 align:middle line:84%
So something's wrong
with that picture.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible that
the priests of Yahweh

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:28.670 align:middle line:84%
really did make that up
to put the fear of god

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:30.190 align:middle line:90%
into their people.

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And I say this only
because if you remember,

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.120 align:middle line:84%
whoever Yahweh
was or Jehovah, he

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.890 align:middle line:84%
did give the 10
commandments that

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:38.790 align:middle line:84%
said don't lie,
cheat, steal, or kill.

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:42.080 align:middle line:84%
So why would he then say,
go into the land of Cana,

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.456 align:middle line:84%
kill everybody,
steal everything,

00:31:44.456 --> 00:31:45.330 align:middle line:90%
and murder everybody.

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I found
that perplexing,

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:47.510 align:middle line:90%
even as a little girl.

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: It didn't
make any sense.

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:52.250 align:middle line:10%
So it could very well be
that Yahweh never even said

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:56.740 align:middle line:10%
that, that they just made it
up to create national unity,

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:01.000 align:middle line:10%
to put a lot of fear, to
build the machismo of what

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.620 align:middle line:10%
their community appeared to be.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.640 align:middle line:90%
We are god-fearing people.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And as we know, fear
actually blocks us.

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:10.500 align:middle line:90%
It contracts our DNA.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Love is what expands
the DNA and allows

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:16.760 align:middle line:84%
us to access more of our
spiritual connection with god.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So as Jesus says later when
he comes in 500 years later,

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:26.110 align:middle line:84%
around 0 BC, he winds
up saying, these priests

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:27.840 align:middle line:90%
are waterless canals.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.800 align:middle line:84%
They neither will go in the door
of enlightenment themselves,

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.492 align:middle line:84%
nor will they allow
their own people to.

00:32:34.492 --> 00:32:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
in Babylon, they

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:37.580 align:middle line:90%
created all these midrashes.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And midrashes--
I'm sure there were

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.340 align:middle line:84%
some good things
in the midrashes,

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.400 align:middle line:84%
but there were a lot
of nonsensical things

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.960 align:middle line:84%
like, if you climb a ladder
and step on your tassel,

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:49.690 align:middle line:84%
you must wait until a
person comes and gets you.

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:53.720 align:middle line:84%
On Saturday, their Sabbath,
you can't walk 2,000 paces.

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.480 align:middle line:90%
You can't make anything.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.470 align:middle line:90%
You can't heal anybody.

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:58.040 align:middle line:90%
You can't create anything.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.680 align:middle line:90%
You can't buy anything.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
complaints of Jesus.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:03.760 align:middle line:90%
He healed on the Sabbath.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And so here he's
doing god's work.

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It created a very
structured, obedient society.

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:09.655 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Yes.

00:33:09.655 --> 00:33:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when you had
the matriarchy, so to speak,

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.310 align:middle line:84%
you weren't talking about
the same kind of obedience.

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:21.980 align:middle line:84%
There was much more free
expression among all people.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And this included
sexual rites and such

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:27.280 align:middle line:84%
that were used for a
purpose at that time.

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.515 align:middle line:84%
All of that was
essentially annihilated.

00:33:29.515 --> 00:33:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: Well, that's
a whole other piece to it,

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:33.170 align:middle line:84%
which is when
people got married,

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:34.900 align:middle line:84%
they were faithful
to each other.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.690 align:middle line:84%
But there was one or
two holidays of the year

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:41.290 align:middle line:84%
where, for three days
and three nights--

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:42.870 align:middle line:84%
or at least for
one day and night--

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:46.970 align:middle line:84%
they had this celebration
annually to the divine son.

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:49.760 align:middle line:84%
So the whole idea
was that, like we

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.250 align:middle line:84%
study Eastee-- we have the
Easter holiday-- they have one

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:57.820 align:middle line:84%
very similar where the
pure unblemished son of god

00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.106 align:middle line:90%
supposedly dies.

00:33:59.106 --> 00:34:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Of course, he
doesn't really die.

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:04.090 align:middle line:84%
They anoint his body as Mary
Magdalen anointed Jesus later,

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:08.290 align:middle line:84%
marking him as the incarnation
of the next great son of god

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:09.889 align:middle line:90%
or Horus King.

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:14.580 align:middle line:84%
The young man is laid into a
cave for three days and three

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.650 align:middle line:84%
nights and at least
symbolically is dead.

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:20.050 align:middle line:84%
At the end of that time,
he comes out of the cave.

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:21.050 align:middle line:90%
He is risen.

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:22.350 align:middle line:90%
He's resurrected.

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:24.030 align:middle line:90%
And everyone celebrates.

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:25.909 align:middle line:84%
So during those three
days and three nights,

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:30.685 align:middle line:84%
everyone's crying really for the
loss of the divine solar lord.

00:34:30.685 --> 00:34:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And they might
have been grieving

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:34.560 align:middle line:84%
their own fathers
and their own sons

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.210 align:middle line:84%
and the men who had given
their lives for the tribe.

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:40.090 align:middle line:84%
So when the young
man comes out, he

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:43.310 align:middle line:84%
is risen for whatever it
was-- a day and a night,

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:46.500 align:middle line:84%
or three days, there was
something called the Hieros

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.610 align:middle line:90%
Gamos, the sacred marriage.

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was a time when,
in a very sacred way,

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.880 align:middle line:84%
in a ritualistic way, you
could sleep with anybody

00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:00.090 align:middle line:84%
you chose in order to
experience this Kundalini rising

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:03.340 align:middle line:84%
into high states of
ecstatic ecstasy.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And of course, what this
means is, for the patriarchy,

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:12.180 align:middle line:84%
if they've taken over
the land rights and all--

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:14.900 align:middle line:84%
you know, they can have sex with
anybody they want, those boys.

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:18.730 align:middle line:84%
But if a woman has
sex with anybody else,

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:21.620 align:middle line:84%
they can't prove that
that child is theirs.

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.470 align:middle line:84%
So if the land passes
through the mother,

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:26.410 align:middle line:84%
everyone can prove that
that woman had that baby

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:27.450 align:middle line:90%
because they saw it.

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:29.190 align:middle line:10%
But if it passes
through the man's line,

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:32.450 align:middle line:10%
the only way to be sure
that it's that man's child

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:34.364 align:middle line:10%
is to punish the women.

00:35:34.364 --> 00:35:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:37.230 align:middle line:84%
To make sure they only
have sex with that one man.

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: Even though
the man, of course,

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:40.490 align:middle line:84%
can have multiple
wives and concubines.

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:41.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Solomon had 600--

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 600 and
300 concubines.

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:45.430 align:middle line:90%
600 wives, 300 concubines.

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Unbelievable.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's excessive.

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: I mean,
that poor boy.

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:49.360 align:middle line:90%
I mean, imagine.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he would have had
to have sex how many times?

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Three times a day to even have
slept with all the women one

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:56.440 align:middle line:90%
time in a year.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.190 align:middle line:90%
That's exhausting.

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:59.273 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a lot of it,
as you say in the book,

00:35:59.273 --> 00:36:00.440 align:middle line:90%
was strictly political, too.

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.981 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: I'm sure there were
a lot of political alliances.

00:36:02.981 --> 00:36:05.035 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Unconsummated
marriages there.

00:36:05.035 --> 00:36:05.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Yes.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:06.780 align:middle line:90%
But imagine the women.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.870 align:middle line:84%
They basically have to hang
out with a bunch of women

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:10.500 align:middle line:84%
in a harem for the
rest of their lives.

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.416 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Pretty much.

00:36:11.416 --> 00:36:12.540 align:middle line:90%
1,000 women and one guy.

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:13.492 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:13.492 --> 00:36:15.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: It might be
somebody's dream, but--

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's go down a
path that you just opened up

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.440 align:middle line:84%
a minute ago, which
has to do, which

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:24.440 align:middle line:84%
had to do with the Horus, Jesus
or Christ as the Horus King.

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
you talk about in the female

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:27.480 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.990 align:middle line:84%
This has been certainly
considered and talked about

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:38.150 align:middle line:84%
for decades-- the notion that an
entity or a couple of entities

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:42.230 align:middle line:84%
have reincarnated at
pivotal periods of history

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:45.380 align:middle line:84%
throughout history, throughout
the history of this planet,

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:49.250 align:middle line:84%
to help uphold a certain energy
or knowledge of the time,

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:51.730 align:middle line:84%
as though we were threatened
with some kind of fall

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:54.340 align:middle line:84%
from grace at that
particular period.

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.050 align:middle line:90%
And we look at that with Horus.

00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
physical incarnations

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.670 align:middle line:84%
of beings that express that
Horus energy, including one

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:06.050 align:middle line:84%
thought to be the one that
was known as Jesus Christ,

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:13.180 align:middle line:84%
as reflective of the Sun
King-- S-O-N, S-U-N-- of god,

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.650 align:middle line:90%
however you want to look at it.

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it's complex but
simple at the same time.

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:20.490 align:middle line:84%
You're saying that
the companion to that

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:25.050 align:middle line:84%
is that the Isis Mary
trajectory is exactly the same.

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:29.252 align:middle line:84%
There have been these elevated
entities incarnating as female.

00:37:29.252 --> 00:37:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Yes.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:30.265 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:37:30.265 --> 00:37:32.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about that for a little bit.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:33.833 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: It's a
great conversation.

00:37:33.833 --> 00:37:37.100 align:middle line:84%
So just to back up in
terms of the solar lords--

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.800 align:middle line:84%
these great solar lords
do come, and they're

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.850 align:middle line:84%
known to sort of come between
the change of the ages.

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:47.910 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus came between the change
of Aries, the 2,160 year cycle.

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:51.140 align:middle line:90%
And now the beginning of Pisces.

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:53.102 align:middle line:84%
So now here we are
towards the end of Pisces

00:37:53.102 --> 00:37:54.810 align:middle line:84%
and the beginning of
the age of Aquarius.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:57.170 align:middle line:84%
So I would say we're
probably due for one of them

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:59.740 align:middle line:84%
to come back in the next
couple of hundred years,

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:01.020 align:middle line:90%
if not sooner.

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:04.000 align:middle line:84%
So these were known in the
ancient world as the Aion--

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.340 align:middle line:84%
A-I-O-N-- that was the
light bringer for each age.

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And they usually appear
at the beginning.

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:12.302 align:middle line:84%
They sort of give
the key message

00:38:12.302 --> 00:38:14.260 align:middle line:84%
to keep us on track with
the light in that age.

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:15.884 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And these
are higher messages

00:38:15.884 --> 00:38:18.470 align:middle line:84%
that are ordered toward
the path to the sun.

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:19.840 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Exactly.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And the ancients in the mystery
schools looked at the sun

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.680 align:middle line:90%
as if it had three levels.

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.630 align:middle line:84%
The great central
sun, which would

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:30.750 align:middle line:84%
be beyond our comprehension
at the highest level of light

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:33.030 align:middle line:90%
in the higher inner planes.

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:37.270 align:middle line:84%
The sun that's in our sky, which
is a portal, a direct portal,

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.770 align:middle line:90%
into that.

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A physical
manifestation of that.

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: A perfect
physical manifestation.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And then what they called
the soular-- S-O-U-L-A-R--

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.190 align:middle line:84%
the soular sun, which is
the physical manifestation

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:53.680 align:middle line:84%
of a human being who-- or a
divinity that comes in the form

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:54.620 align:middle line:90%
of a human being.

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now,
and interestingly,

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.880 align:middle line:84%
some of the more
ancient traditions

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:03.530 align:middle line:84%
suggest there were,
indeed, chosen people.

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And they were the
ones who upheld

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:10.400 align:middle line:84%
the way and the
knowledge of the path

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.775 align:middle line:84%
to the sun, called the
children of the sun.

00:39:12.775 --> 00:39:14.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: Well, the
Essenes call themselves

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.550 align:middle line:90%
the children of the sun.

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And many of these
other groups did.

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:23.420 align:middle line:84%
What Jesus taught that we know
about in the Bible was the way.

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:25.740 align:middle line:84%
But in my book, I
talk about the fact

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:28.670 align:middle line:84%
that the way was actually--
they used a symbol.

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:30.400 align:middle line:90%
The way of the chalice.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's because the chalice
has a feminine aspect, the cup,

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:37.190 align:middle line:84%
a masculine aspect, the
stem, and of course,

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:39.350 align:middle line:90%
it grounds down into the earth.

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:41.550 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a
receptacle to receive

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:43.430 align:middle line:90%
the light of the divine.

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:47.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's the union of the male
and female in perfect balance

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.640 align:middle line:84%
that is the actual
path of the way.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus tells us
this when he says,

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:56.920 align:middle line:84%
when you make the two eyes into
one, the inner into the outer,

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.970 align:middle line:84%
the outer into the
inner, the male at part

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:02.810 align:middle line:84%
into the female and the
female into the male,

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:04.767 align:middle line:84%
then you shall see
the kingdom of heaven.

00:40:04.767 --> 00:40:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Because we have to remember,
everything exists in balance.

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Positive, negative are
always there in balance

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.980 align:middle line:84%
to create that perfect, as
the Buddhists would say,

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:15.700 align:middle line:90%
middle path.

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Right.

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, Buddha taught
the middle path.

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.860 align:middle line:90%
Thoth taught the ancient path.

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.120 align:middle line:90%
What is the Tao?

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.360 align:middle line:84%
The Tao literally
means "the way."

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at that
beautiful symbol of the two

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:29.580 align:middle line:84%
sort of-- they look like
little tadpoles in a circle--

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:31.690 align:middle line:84%
inside the masculine
is the feminine,

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:34.060 align:middle line:84%
inside the feminine
is the masculine.

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So as Jesus says, as within
every man is a woman,

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:40.990 align:middle line:90%
within every woman is a man.

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:43.580 align:middle line:84%
So we have both the
male and female.

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And the spiritual technology
they were teaching

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:49.270 align:middle line:84%
was the middle path
of awakening the heart

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:52.600 align:middle line:84%
and then awakening the third
eye so that you could pull back

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:55.740 align:middle line:84%
the veil-- as the ancients
called it, the veils of Isis--

00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:59.140 align:middle line:84%
we could pull back the
veils of our outer sight

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:00.630 align:middle line:90%
to see inwardly.

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:02.390 align:middle line:90%
The kingdom of heaven is within.

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And begin to actually have
these spiritual experiences

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:06.090 align:middle line:90%
for ourselves.

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
the mysteries were

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:09.410 align:middle line:90%
all about all over the world.

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:09.992 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:41:09.992 --> 00:41:11.450 align:middle line:84%
There was an outer
level where they

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:14.230 align:middle line:84%
were teaching you healing
and herbs and math

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:17.740 align:middle line:84%
and sacred geometry and law
and science and astronomy

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:18.550 align:middle line:90%
and astrology.

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:22.220 align:middle line:84%
But those were just the outer
expressions of the cosmos

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:29.850 align:middle line:84%
where we can begin to be awed
with the wonder universal laws

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:31.560 align:middle line:90%
expressed in the natural world.

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.710 align:middle line:84%
The other part of the
mysteries, which you can only

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:38.240 align:middle line:84%
access through the feminine
and through the axis

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:42.757 align:middle line:84%
between the two, is out
of body experiences,

00:41:42.757 --> 00:41:45.090 align:middle line:84%
where you can travel in these
inner planes for yourself.

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason,
perhaps maybe

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:50.520 align:middle line:84%
because I've done it in other
lifetimes, since I was a child,

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.670 align:middle line:84%
I have had the ability to
see clairvoyantly and hear

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:55.050 align:middle line:90%
clairaudiently.

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:58.530 align:middle line:84%
So as you know, it sort of
began when I was a child

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:01.080 align:middle line:84%
and went to the forest and
spent all that meditative time.

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.450 align:middle line:84%
So much my brain waves
probably calmed down

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:06.550 align:middle line:84%
from chatty little beta
brain into alpha and theta,

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:09.880 align:middle line:84%
where I began to be able to
perceive those subtle energy

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:10.700 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And once that door was
open, then these angels

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:15.120 align:middle line:90%
began teaching me.

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.540 align:middle line:90%
And so then we went from there.

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is not just
a gift that I have.

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:23.295 align:middle line:84%
These are inner senses everybody
has at a dormant level.

00:42:23.295 --> 00:42:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you just
said a critical thing,

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:29.010 align:middle line:84%
just like when you met Shasta
in her little fairy cabin

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:33.440 align:middle line:84%
in the woods, is
nature has the ability

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:36.160 align:middle line:84%
to help us transmute
that frenetic energy

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:42.060 align:middle line:84%
into this very balanced,
wavelength pattern.

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:46.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's a really big assist
in accessing that aspect

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:47.910 align:middle line:90%
of our consciousness.

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: And I think anybody
who has spent a lot of time

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.680 align:middle line:84%
in nature, unless you're sitting
around the fire drinking beer

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:57.280 align:middle line:84%
and inebriating yourself,
if you've really spent time

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:00.260 align:middle line:84%
in nature, by a waterfall,
by a creek, in the forest,

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:02.900 align:middle line:90%
you feel the birds.

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:05.050 align:middle line:84%
The beauty of it
opens the heart.

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:06.200 align:middle line:90%
It opens the mind.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to attune
to the subtle levels.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And this actually brings
us to the concept--

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is
in perfect balance.

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:14.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: In perfect
balance until man

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.130 align:middle line:90%
comes in and disturbs it.

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And we seem to be
very good at that.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.670 align:middle line:84%
But this kind of
brings us to concepts

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:23.880 align:middle line:84%
that in the ancient world were
called Immanence and, of course

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:26.050 align:middle line:84%
in the Judeo-Christian
teachings,

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:27.780 align:middle line:90%
became known as transcendence.

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people don't
know these concepts.

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.640 align:middle line:90%
But I think it's important.

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Immanence is the belief that the
divine exists within reality,

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:38.900 align:middle line:90%
within what we can see.

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.670 align:middle line:90%
You have a divine spark in you.

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:43.300 align:middle line:84%
All of our listeners have
a divine spark in them.

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Our kitty cats, our puppy
dogs, all of the animals,

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:50.930 align:middle line:84%
the planet herself, the
entire manifest world

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:52.310 align:middle line:90%
is manifest from what?

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:53.790 align:middle line:90%
From the divine.

00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:57.080 align:middle line:84%
In truth, we're in the
bubble of the divine.

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:58.490 align:middle line:90%
What is it that creates this?

00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:02.310 align:middle line:84%
It's not like it's divorced
from god or the goddess.

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:04.870 align:middle line:84%
We are literally in
the body of the divine.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:08.430 align:middle line:84%
So some aspects of
that divine nature

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:10.190 align:middle line:84%
are not very aware
of themselves,

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:12.270 align:middle line:90%
whether it's human or animal.

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:14.970 align:middle line:90%
Others are more self-aware.

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Some express more of that divine
purpose in a beautiful way

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:21.970 align:middle line:84%
and some seem to be
fighting it tooth and nail

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:23.660 align:middle line:90%
in a very destructive way.

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And so Immanence is the
sacred within all things.

00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And honoring the sacred within
all things means that instead

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:33.330 align:middle line:84%
of raping, pillaging the
earth, we're actually beginning

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:35.920 align:middle line:84%
to realize that the
earth is a living being,

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:39.120 align:middle line:84%
that life cannot come
from something dead.

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And we get all our
food-- everything

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:45.220 align:middle line:84%
that we ingest, everything
that we have in our world--

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.240 align:middle line:84%
from the stone of
this beautiful table,

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:49.660 align:middle line:84%
to the beautiful
jewelry you have on,

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:51.180 align:middle line:90%
to the food that we eat.

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.750 align:middle line:90%
It all comes from the mother.

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's an
electromagnetic world.

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:57.527 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
psychologically--

00:44:57.527 --> 00:44:59.360 align:middle line:84%
as you talk about in
your book quite a bit--

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:02.720 align:middle line:84%
we were taken down the path
of just the electrical field,

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.600 align:middle line:84%
the electric aspect
of life, which

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.910 align:middle line:84%
is the masculine
aspect, which doesn't

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:10.320 align:middle line:84%
exist without the magnetic,
without the feminine.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the
process of creation.

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:17.090 align:middle line:84%
The divine initial whisper
that helps creation

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:19.200 align:middle line:90%
form the material world.

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.010 align:middle line:90%
All is dependent on each other.

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
that half eliminated,

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:28.590 align:middle line:84%
the feminine half
eliminated psychically,

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:30.770 align:middle line:84%
you can see how we've
ended up where we are.

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's not to continue
going down the path of-- we

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:35.460 align:middle line:90%
know this.

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.220 align:middle line:84%
We can see the
evidence for ourselves.

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.880 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to participate
in it if we don't choose to.

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.740 align:middle line:84%
But to psychically
bring back the notion

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:45.060 align:middle line:84%
of the inherent balance
within the universe,

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:48.250 align:middle line:84%
within every cell in our
body, between man and woman,

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:51.100 align:middle line:84%
the masculine and feminine,
however it's showing itself,

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:52.225 align:middle line:90%
is critical.

00:45:52.225 --> 00:45:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: It's critical.

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And this why Immanence and
transcendence are important,

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.040 align:middle line:84%
because most of us don't
really realize we've

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.710 align:middle line:90%
inherited these theologies.

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:02.810 align:middle line:84%
We don't even realize how
we've been programmed.

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:03.260 align:middle line:90%
Transcendence--

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's deeply
subconscious at this point.

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: It's very
deeply subconscious.

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And we've been taught that
heaven is up and hell is down.

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So by subconscious association,
what's below our feet?

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:13.410 align:middle line:90%
The earth.

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:15.466 align:middle line:90%
So let's just maim it.

00:46:15.466 --> 00:46:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Damn her with it.

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:17.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Right.

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:18.070 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:19.960 align:middle line:84%
We'll send space
missions to Mars

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:22.850 align:middle line:84%
to think we're going to colonize
Mars when we have a paradise

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:23.601 align:middle line:90%
planet right here.

00:46:23.601 --> 00:46:24.433 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But it is.

00:46:24.433 --> 00:46:26.020 align:middle line:84%
It's deeply
subconscious, these ideas

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:27.144 align:middle line:90%
that have been given to us.

00:46:27.144 --> 00:46:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is
carnal and of the earth

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:33.900 align:middle line:84%
was considered to be sinful the
last couple of thousand years,

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.060 align:middle line:90%
when it's anything but.

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:36.510 align:middle line:90%
These are all reflections of--

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: The divine.

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:38.838 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The saying,
as above, so below.

00:46:38.838 --> 00:46:40.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: So
with transcendence,

00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:43.820 align:middle line:84%
that belief is that god
is outside of creation.

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:46.300 align:middle line:90%
Now both are true.

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.590 align:middle line:84%
The divine is outside
of creation and inside

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:49.490 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:52.800 align:middle line:84%
The divine is more transcendent
that what we can see,

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.840 align:middle line:84%
but the divine is
also here, now,

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.940 align:middle line:84%
in you, me, and
everything around us.

00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:00.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that one is
true and the other is not.

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:02.540 align:middle line:90%
It's just like you say.

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:05.540 align:middle line:84%
The electrical is true
and the magnetic is true.

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:08.820 align:middle line:84%
The masculine has its place
and it's a beautiful masculine.

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:14.060 align:middle line:84%
The goddess would hate existence
without the divine masculine.

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:17.820 align:middle line:84%
He is her beloved,
as she should be his.

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:20.780 align:middle line:84%
So what I think we are
in the process of doing

00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:22.534 align:middle line:84%
is about trying
to find a balance.

00:47:22.534 --> 00:47:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And there are, of course,
a lot of amazing men

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:28.670 align:middle line:84%
that are coming in today that
are kind, intuitive, spiritual,

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:31.800 align:middle line:84%
heart-based, and about
trying to help bring

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.960 align:middle line:84%
this back into the
world, just as there

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:36.680 align:middle line:84%
are wonderful women like
yourself who are really

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:41.050 align:middle line:84%
doing the work to try to
bring the divine feminine back

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:42.430 align:middle line:90%
into balance.

00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's a dance that,
because of the politicization

00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:52.680 align:middle line:84%
of our times of the
notion of feminism,

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:55.899 align:middle line:84%
for example, it's
really cast women--

00:47:55.899 --> 00:47:58.440 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not saying anything that
every single person watching

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.440 align:middle line:84%
this doesn't know and
hasn't known for decades--

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:03.820 align:middle line:84%
but there are ramifications
to this, to place

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:06.710 align:middle line:84%
the woman in a
position for survival

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:11.300 align:middle line:84%
to compete with men on a turf
that was dominantly male at one

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:14.760 align:middle line:84%
time and had to open up
just because of basic rights

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.290 align:middle line:84%
and laws that were passed
and so forth to women,

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:21.520 align:middle line:84%
still has repercussions
that exist to this day.

00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And whether it comes down
to pay, for example--

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:26.020 align:middle line:84%
the pay standards
have never been

00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:28.930 align:middle line:84%
equalized for the same
job for men and women

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:30.880 align:middle line:90%
still to this day.

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:36.086 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot that has not
yet been reckoned with,

00:48:36.086 --> 00:48:37.210 align:middle line:90%
I think is what I'm saying.

00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's so deeply
subconscious that there's

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:42.150 align:middle line:84%
a part of femininity--
well, there

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:43.860 align:middle line:84%
are studies that
are done on this.

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful studies,
interesting studies,

00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:49.610 align:middle line:84%
where someone will apply
for a job and a man

00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:51.870 align:middle line:84%
will classically have
no trouble asking

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:54.300 align:middle line:84%
for a job that is above
his pay grade because

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:56.300 align:middle line:84%
of the inherent
confidence from having

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.000 align:middle line:90%
been in control for so long.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Women may be
overqualified for the job

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.420 align:middle line:84%
and still self-conscious
to ask for it.

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:05.430 align:middle line:84%
After all this time,
these things still exist.

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:09.699 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about rooting
out deeply subconsciously

00:49:09.699 --> 00:49:10.240 align:middle line:90%
held beliefs.

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: It's totally true.

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:17.410 align:middle line:84%
When I began to be initiated
into these Egyptian mysteries

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:19.890 align:middle line:84%
and Celtic mysteries and goddess
mysteries that are really

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:24.560 align:middle line:84%
all over the world and were
for thousands of years,

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:26.740 align:middle line:90%
it was a huge revelation to me.

00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:30.300 align:middle line:84%
I had not really realized
that I had accepted

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.720 align:middle line:84%
certain subconscious
beliefs like,

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.410 align:middle line:84%
yes, Eve was to
blame for everything

00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:38.010 align:middle line:84%
and therefore she should
be subjugated forever.

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And when I did the research for
this book, the things I found

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:45.970 align:middle line:84%
that the early church
fathers said-- by early,

00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:52.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean the first 1,000 years--
they said as late as the 1800s,

00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:57.030 align:middle line:84%
my Bible demands the
subjugation of women forever.

00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:59.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, what?

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:01.020 align:middle line:90%
Where does it say that?

00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And so it was, again, this male
patriarchal priest of Yahweh.

00:50:05.850 --> 00:50:07.850 align:middle line:90%
And they weren't the only ones.

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, a third of
my friends are wonderful--

00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Every society that
exists right now is essentially

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:14.450 align:middle line:90%
marching to that same tune.

00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:16.700 align:middle line:84%
Women have been
subjugated planetary

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:17.870 align:middle line:90%
for quite a long time now.

00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:18.578 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Yeah.

00:50:18.578 --> 00:50:22.550 align:middle line:84%
It's been about
2,500 to 3,000 years.

00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And so when we begin to
talk about the divine Horus

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:30.290 align:middle line:84%
King and the Sophia energy,
which is a question you brought

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:33.260 align:middle line:84%
up a few minutes ago,
I think that's a very--

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:35.590 align:middle line:84%
it was a very profound
revelation for me

00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:39.310 align:middle line:90%
in the process of discovery.

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:42.140 align:middle line:84%
What we talk about as the
Horus King is, for those of you

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:44.640 align:middle line:84%
who are listening who
might not be aware of it,

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:47.480 align:middle line:84%
the story is that
after the great flood,

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Isis and Osiris, who were
half brother and sister,

00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:54.570 align:middle line:84%
but among those
long-lived Annunaki gods,

00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:56.510 align:middle line:84%
looked down at the
suffering of humanity

00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:58.480 align:middle line:84%
and the complete
devastation and said

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.080 align:middle line:90%
we have to help the humans.

00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And so they begin to set up
Egypt and then Osiris travelled

00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:07.010 align:middle line:84%
for 450 years bringing
food to people.

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:08.370 align:middle line:90%
He was a musician.

00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And when they came and he
fed them, then he had seeds

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:13.300 align:middle line:84%
and he taught them
how to cultivate.

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:17.124 align:middle line:84%
And this moved in the
whole agrarian cultures.

00:51:17.124 --> 00:51:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And he was known
as the Green God.

00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And he was beloved all over the
world for his absolute service.

00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And for my money,
he was the same soul

00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:26.580 align:middle line:90%
that had incarnated as Jesus.

00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:28.730 align:middle line:90%
He was a musician.

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:29.590 align:middle line:90%
He was a poet.

00:51:29.590 --> 00:51:33.480 align:middle line:84%
He was an amazing
server of humanity.

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Isis, meantime, was
setting up Egypt.

00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And her epitaphs
are like this long.

00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Ender of Cannibalism,
Instituter of Marriage, Discover

00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:45.760 align:middle line:84%
of the First Womb--
loom, not womb.

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.260 align:middle line:90%
Loom.

00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:47.380 align:middle line:90%
Maybe womb, too.

00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:51.260 align:middle line:90%
But Inventor of the First Sail.

00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:52.920 align:middle line:90%
She was the goddess of healing--

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:55.136 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Establishing
genuine civilization.

00:51:55.136 --> 00:51:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: Civilization,
in a very high fashion.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And so then they-- her
father was actually

00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Thoth, the god of wisdom,
so he was helping.

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.640 align:middle line:84%
This was sort of the Christed
group that was around then.

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And then Set, who was the
half brother of Osiris,

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:16.110 align:middle line:84%
was very jealous because Osiris
got northern Egypt, where

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:17.740 align:middle line:90%
the pyramids are and so forth.

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:20.290 align:middle line:90%
And Set got southern Egypt.

00:52:20.290 --> 00:52:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And eventually he
basically tricked

00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Osiris, trapped him in
a box, a big coffin,

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:28.550 align:middle line:90%
and threw it in the Nile.

00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And Isis of course
realized immediately

00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:33.106 align:middle line:90%
what all this meant.

00:52:33.106 --> 00:52:34.480 align:middle line:84%
She went into
grief and mourning.

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.240 align:middle line:90%
She eventually found his body.

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.440 align:middle line:84%
But she understood that Set
had taken over all of Egypt.

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:40.420 align:middle line:90%
So Egypt was plunged--

00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was one
of the dark forces.

00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:44.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're looking
even just metaphorically,

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:45.890 align:middle line:84%
it's when the darkness
of consciousness

00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:49.680 align:middle line:84%
moved in-- the petty priesthoods
and divvying things back up

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:52.680 align:middle line:84%
again and moving away from
the more divine principles.

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: So we had 450 years
of darkness where Set ruled.

00:52:57.850 --> 00:53:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And then Isis actually
managed to impregnate herself.

00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:04.780 align:middle line:84%
The stories are all
these mythical stories

00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:08.180 align:middle line:84%
about how she turned into a
kite and impregnated herself

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:09.180 align:middle line:90%
and resurrected Osiris--

00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:11.215 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Still a
virgin birth, again.

00:53:11.215 --> 00:53:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Exactly.

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe she really
actually did that.

00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:17.569 align:middle line:84%
But maybe they were
so sophisticated she

00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:18.735 align:middle line:90%
had artificial insemination.

00:53:18.735 --> 00:53:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this
story appears repeatedly

00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and at the same times of the
year, of the solar cycles.

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Exactly.

00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So she raised Horus in
secret down in Philae.

00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And of course, her
sister Nephthys,

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:32.910 align:middle line:84%
who had been married
to Set, left Set

00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:35.510 align:middle line:84%
and became-- this is where the
first Order of the Magdalens

00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:36.430 align:middle line:90%
was set up.

00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:40.050 align:middle line:84%
They were the watchtower to
protect the Horus King who they

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:43.120 align:middle line:84%
hoped would grow up and
live long enough to defeat

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:45.190 align:middle line:90%
the darkness, to defeat Set.

00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we get the
word Satan from Set's name,

00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:51.540 align:middle line:90%
which was Satu, S-A-T-U.

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So he represented lying,
cheating, murdering, killing,

00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:57.890 align:middle line:90%
ego, vanity, all those things.

00:53:57.890 --> 00:54:02.720 align:middle line:84%
So of course eventually that
did happen and Horus restored

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:05.940 align:middle line:84%
light and order and
Maat, as they called

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:08.660 align:middle line:90%
it-- cosmic order-- and Isis.

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:09.970 align:middle line:90%
And so she was everything.

00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:14.610 align:middle line:84%
She was a mother, a daughter,
a wife, a queen, a refugee,

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:19.680 align:middle line:84%
a magician, a healer, and the
restorer of light to the world.

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.230 align:middle line:90%
Isis, Isis.

00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:23.560 align:middle line:84%
The "I am" principle
of the divine mother.

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's very interesting to
me that we now have this crazy

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.040 align:middle line:84%
thing going on with the
media that's the War on Tara,

00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:33.050 align:middle line:84%
T-A-R-A, the earth,
and the war on Isis.

00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:36.030 align:middle line:84%
We will destroy and annihilate
Isis, when that's not even

00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:36.530 align:middle line:90%
their name.

00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:38.780 align:middle line:90%
Their name is ISIL, I think.

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And Obama, to his
credit, never uses Isis.

00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure he's very
aware of this.

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:47.060 align:middle line:84%
But whoever the
Illuminati people

00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:50.120 align:middle line:84%
are that are this
patriarchy that are really

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:54.830 align:middle line:84%
about trying to suppress
this possibility of balance,

00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:59.610 align:middle line:84%
it's an opportunity to try
to smear in the subconscious

00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:03.150 align:middle line:84%
the name of something,
this very high being, who

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:06.220 align:middle line:84%
had great love for
humanity and who represents

00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:07.680 align:middle line:90%
that feminine principle.

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:10.700 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus says,
and I talk about--

00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:13.300 align:middle line:84%
I have about five chapters
about his hidden teachings--

00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
were very ordered

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:20.260 align:middle line:84%
toward the support
of men spending

00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:23.490 align:middle line:84%
after the divine in
themselves, the adoration,

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:26.380 align:middle line:84%
on the women in their lives
and the feminine principles.

00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:27.967 align:middle line:84%
He was very much
ordered toward that.

00:55:27.967 --> 00:55:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: Totally.

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.850 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the big
things he came to do.

00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:34.090 align:middle line:84%
But in truth, the
age of Aries, it's

00:55:34.090 --> 00:55:37.290 align:middle line:84%
a masculine age, ruled
by the god of war.

00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:42.710 align:middle line:84%
So from about 2100 BC
to the time of Jesus,

00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:44.900 align:middle line:84%
we had war, war,
war, and more war.

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:47.870 align:middle line:84%
The Assyrians, the Sumerians,
the Egyptians, the Hebrews.

00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:49.280 align:middle line:90%
We had Alexander the Great.

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:51.030 align:middle line:84%
We had the rise of
the Roman empire.

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:51.750 align:middle line:90%
Mamma Mia.

00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:53.450 align:middle line:90%
They were having lots of wars.

00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:54.950 align:middle line:90%
So the patriarchy.

00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:58.620 align:middle line:84%
So these aions come in between
the change of the ages,

00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:01.300 align:middle line:84%
but that was the hardest
of all the times.

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Because Pisces is really
about the god of love,

00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:07.470 align:middle line:84%
unconditional forgiveness
and compassion

00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:09.660 align:middle line:90%
and the transcendental realms.

00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And so you have this
masculine, aggressive energy,

00:56:12.790 --> 00:56:15.880 align:middle line:84%
the victimizer, hitting
this feminine energy,

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.900 align:middle line:90%
which became the victim.

00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:19.819 align:middle line:84%
So what we had could
have gone either way.

00:56:19.819 --> 00:56:21.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Jesus
delivered the messages.

00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:22.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But it was hijacked.

00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:24.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: It was hijacked.

00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:27.480 align:middle line:90%
And so then we the inquisition.

00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:30.760 align:middle line:84%
First, for the first 1,000
years until about 1300,

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:33.830 align:middle line:84%
anybody that disagreed with the
Church was called a heretic.

00:56:33.830 --> 00:56:35.350 align:middle line:90%
And there was no witchcraft.

00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And then from about 1300,
after the very successful seven

00:56:39.090 --> 00:56:41.180 align:middle line:84%
or eight crusades, the
Albigensian Crusades

00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:43.820 align:middle line:84%
in the 1200s that took out
the Cathars, that took out

00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:45.380 align:middle line:84%
the Knights Templar,
that took out

00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:48.620 align:middle line:84%
the Waldensians, after this,
they were like, hey, yummy.

00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:49.250 align:middle line:90%
This works.

00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:50.630 align:middle line:90%
We'll just murder them all.

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to call
them-- hm, what shall we say?

00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:54.220 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we'll call them witches.

00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:54.850 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:56:54.850 --> 00:56:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
a whole a network

00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:02.480 align:middle line:84%
within the villages of
male and female healers.

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:05.520 align:middle line:84%
The druids-- there
was a male elder

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.090 align:middle line:90%
and he picked his successor.

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:09.070 align:middle line:84%
There was a female
elder, she picked hers.

00:57:09.070 --> 00:57:11.240 align:middle line:84%
They were sent to
school to become

00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:13.310 align:middle line:84%
the healers and the
teachers and the wisdom

00:57:13.310 --> 00:57:15.820 align:middle line:90%
people for the next generation.

00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:17.900 align:middle line:84%
So how could they
get rid of them?

00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, we'll just
call anybody that

00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:21.800 align:middle line:90%
does any of this work a witch.

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:25.620 align:middle line:84%
So we have 50 million people--
is what the statistics are--

00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:27.780 align:middle line:90%
being murdered by the Church.

00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And not to slam the Church
alone, because the Jews

00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:32.740 align:middle line:84%
and the Arabs have done a
really good job themselves.

00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:35.690 align:middle line:90%
But there it happens.

00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And then we have about-- they
say about-- nine million women

00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:42.220 align:middle line:84%
during the 5 and 1/2
centuries that's basically

00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:44.310 align:middle line:90%
the Holocaust for women.

00:57:44.310 --> 00:57:45.580 align:middle line:90%
And this is an amazing thing.

00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:47.550 align:middle line:84%
We can all point to
the Jewish Holocaust.

00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:48.990 align:middle line:90%
We got that one.

00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:50.310 align:middle line:90%
That was pretty terrible.

00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:51.730 align:middle line:90%
And let's not repeat it.

00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:54.120 align:middle line:84%
We can point to the Holocaust
for the native American

00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:56.280 align:middle line:90%
Indians, which is horrible.

00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:58.840 align:middle line:84%
We can point to the destruction
of the Chinese people

00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:00.631 align:middle line:84%
and the Coolies that
were brought over here

00:58:00.631 --> 00:58:02.080 align:middle line:90%
on the railroads.

00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:04.760 align:middle line:84%
We can look at the
Holocaust over and over.

00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:09.760 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking about 1,000
years of going after-- well,

00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:12.920 align:middle line:84%
3,000 years probably of going
after women-- but 1,000 years

00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:15.760 align:middle line:84%
where, if you were a healer
or doing anything positive,

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:17.390 align:middle line:90%
you get burned as a witch.

00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:18.969 align:middle line:84%
So no wonder people
are frightened

00:58:18.969 --> 00:58:20.760 align:middle line:84%
and they're scared to
step outside the box.

00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this
still exists today

00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:24.060 align:middle line:84%
because those
reincarnation patterns have

00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:27.450 align:middle line:84%
a very deep memory of
those days and what

00:58:27.450 --> 00:58:30.756 align:middle line:84%
happened to the women
who were involved

00:58:30.756 --> 00:58:33.380 align:middle line:84%
in this kind of higher thinking
and rites and such at the time.

00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:35.260 align:middle line:84%
So we only have a
few minutes left.

00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:38.700 align:middle line:84%
So here we are now, "The
Return of the Divine Sophia."

00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:42.260 align:middle line:84%
So in writing this
book, in whole, what

00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:45.035 align:middle line:90%
were you trying to relay to us?

00:58:45.035 --> 00:58:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: Well first,
I think revealing

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:49.690 align:middle line:84%
what our hidden history
is is very important.

00:58:49.690 --> 00:58:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And also bringing in
the teachings of someone

00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:56.694 align:middle line:84%
as profoundly wise as
Jesus or Isa or Jesuah,

00:58:56.694 --> 00:58:58.110 align:middle line:84%
whatever we want
to call him, that

00:58:58.110 --> 00:59:00.470 align:middle line:84%
profound being that
came down here.

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And his teachings
were that there

00:59:02.090 --> 00:59:05.087 align:middle line:84%
is a divine abba-amma,
father-mother god.

00:59:05.087 --> 00:59:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And of course, this was
changed in the Bible

00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:08.590 align:middle line:90%
to only reflect the masculine.

00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:10.487 align:middle line:90%
So that's the number one thing.

00:59:10.487 --> 00:59:11.570 align:middle line:90%
Father-mother god, which--

00:59:11.570 --> 00:59:13.486 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you have
some beautiful passages

00:59:13.486 --> 00:59:15.230 align:middle line:90%
in there reflecting that.

00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: And those
are his teachings.

00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And he also said there's
a divine daughter and son

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:22.700 align:middle line:84%
and that they come
together from age to age.

00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And he said even
as Mary Magdalen

00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:27.630 align:middle line:84%
is that Mary Sophia,
the incarnation

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:29.710 align:middle line:90%
of the divine daughter energy.

00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Now the Gnostics believe
that she has continually

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:34.970 align:middle line:84%
reincarnated for
the last 2,000 years

00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:37.980 align:middle line:84%
and that she continues
to wait for us to awaken.

00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Jesus actually says that he
cannot return until the divine

00:59:41.850 --> 00:59:44.710 align:middle line:84%
feminine is re-enthroned
in the world.

00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:48.070 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's not him
returning personally,

00:59:48.070 --> 00:59:51.820 align:middle line:84%
which is possible, or the
Christ consciousness awakening

00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:56.980 align:middle line:84%
humanity, this cannot happen
without both genders being

00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:58.275 align:middle line:90%
in balance with one another.

00:59:58.275 --> 00:59:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there's one
thing that has unfortunately

01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:06.470 align:middle line:90%
discredited some of this.

01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And that is-- depending on
the conferences you go to.

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:10.960 align:middle line:84%
I've kind of been
to all of them.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And I've interviewed Margaret
Starbird, wonderful woman,

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:14.360 align:middle line:90%
and others.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:17.000 align:middle line:84%
But I think at one conference
alone, I think half a dozen

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.710 align:middle line:84%
of the women there claim to
be the reincarnation of Mary

01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:20.794 align:middle line:90%
Magdalen.

01:00:20.794 --> 01:00:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: Well,
let me say this.

01:00:22.210 --> 01:00:25.950 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
spirit of the Magdalen,

01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:28.710 align:middle line:84%
the spirit of a lot of these
divine feminine energies,

01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:29.910 align:middle line:90%
are returning.

01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:32.490 align:middle line:84%
I've been very much
involved in the-- not

01:00:32.490 --> 01:00:35.490 align:middle line:84%
only the Magdalen mysteries,
but also the White Buffalo Calf

01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:36.280 align:middle line:90%
Woman story.

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:37.950 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to a
dozen people who claim

01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:40.040 align:middle line:90%
to be a reincarnation of her.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:44.019 align:middle line:84%
The question is not from the
egoic level-- who are we?

01:00:44.019 --> 01:00:46.060 align:middle line:84%
The question is, what do
we do with the time that

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:47.250 align:middle line:90%
is given to us?

01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:49.860 align:middle line:84%
We could call ourselves
something completely out

01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:53.945 align:middle line:84%
of the box-- White
Gourd Woman, White--

01:00:53.945 --> 01:00:55.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:56.170 align:middle line:84%
That's the point I'm
making, is that--

01:00:56.170 --> 01:00:58.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: What are
we doing with our lives

01:00:58.110 --> 01:00:59.990 align:middle line:90%
in the service of this?

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And of course, many
of these people

01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:04.080 align:middle line:84%
who are claiming
this may in fact

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.332 align:middle line:84%
have been in the
Magdalene orders.

01:01:06.332 --> 01:01:08.415 align:middle line:84%
The may actually have had
some kind of connection.

01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:10.415 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the point
I'm trying to get to.

01:01:10.415 --> 01:01:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
experience at that time.

01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And also, these
are massive beings

01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:17.877 align:middle line:84%
that have a massive reach
into our consciousness.

01:01:17.877 --> 01:01:18.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MCCANNON: They do.

01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it can feel
very intimate in nature

01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:25.260 align:middle line:84%
and details can be given, if a
person is open enough, enough

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:28.412 align:middle line:84%
that if the ego engages,
then one might think, oh,

01:01:28.412 --> 01:01:29.370 align:middle line:90%
that must have been me.

01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:30.322 align:middle line:90%
I remember everything.

01:01:30.322 --> 01:01:31.780 align:middle line:84%
When actually it's
just a beautiful

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:34.850 align:middle line:84%
tapping into a field of
knowledge or experience

01:01:34.850 --> 01:01:35.700 align:middle line:90%
that once was.

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's important
to make that point right now.

01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And just as there are men who
claim to be Jesus in Sedona.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:45.170 align:middle line:90%
It happens.

01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:47.870 align:middle line:84%
But it's because,
again, of our openness

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:50.380 align:middle line:90%
to these larger beings.

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: I think as
long as we think it's us,

01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:55.050 align:middle line:90%
we've missed the point.

01:01:55.050 --> 01:01:55.799 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

01:01:55.799 --> 01:01:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: It's
really about-- in order

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:01.070 align:middle line:84%
to bring this energy
back, it's going

01:02:01.070 --> 01:02:04.080 align:middle line:84%
to take the awakening
of many women and men

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:05.600 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, if you're coming
through the Christian matrix,

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.355 align:middle line:90%
perhaps it is the Magdalen.

01:02:10.355 --> 01:02:12.230 align:middle line:84%
If you're coming through
the Native American,

01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:13.813 align:middle line:84%
perhaps it's White
Buffalo Calf Woman.

01:02:13.813 --> 01:02:15.595 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Egyptian,
Isis, or Maat.

01:02:15.595 --> 01:02:18.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: All of these
are beautiful expressions.

01:02:18.590 --> 01:02:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And as we say,
these divine beings

01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:24.630 align:middle line:84%
continue to reincarnate from
age to age and time to time.

01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:28.430 align:middle line:10%
And really in truth, if we
can let the ego move out

01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:32.820 align:middle line:10%
of the way, the truth is that
the divine lives within you,

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:37.140 align:middle line:10%
within me, with all of them,
within all of our listeners.

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And if we can awaken
the part of us that

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:44.190 align:middle line:84%
is the Christ, that is the
Isis, that is the Mary Magdalen,

01:02:44.190 --> 01:02:46.760 align:middle line:84%
it's not about the
little self, it's

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.605 align:middle line:90%
about the divine larger picture.

01:02:48.605 --> 01:02:49.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's a perfect way
to end this conversation.

01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
making that distinction.

01:02:53.810 --> 01:02:54.810 align:middle line:90%
It's important.

01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>MCCANNON: I want
to just say that I

01:02:56.790 --> 01:02:58.340 align:middle line:90%
find you amazing, Regina.

01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:01.482 align:middle line:84%
You're beautiful
and wise and strong.

01:03:01.482 --> 01:03:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, my dear.

01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:03.850 align:middle line:90%
As are you.

01:03:03.850 --> 01:03:06.100 align:middle line:90%
So mirrors.

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:07.480 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.350 align:middle line:10%
Again, the title of
Tricia's newest book

01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:11.940 align:middle line:10%
is "Return of the Divine
Sophia," which you can find

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:13.400 align:middle line:10%
through all major booksellers.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
