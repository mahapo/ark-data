>>REGINA MEREDITH:
In common astrology,

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.240 align:middle line:10%
we often hear about
the return of Saturn,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.280 align:middle line:10%
which brings challenges
into our life.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Why is Saturn known as
the prince of darkness?

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, according to author Troy
McLachlan, once upon a time,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.202 align:middle line:90%
Saturn meant abundance on Earth.

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:24.154 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:24.154 --> 00:00:42.460 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.310 align:middle line:84%
This is a subject that
goes very deep, very vast,

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.170 align:middle line:90%
out into the cosmology itself.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And you say it's more of
an intuitive investigation

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.800 align:middle line:84%
than an academic or
intellectual investigation.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.830 align:middle line:90%
Set that up for us.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.060 align:middle line:90%
What did you mean by that?

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.185 align:middle line:10%
>>TROY MCLACHLAN: Well,
what I was attempting to do

00:00:57.185 --> 00:01:02.390 align:middle line:10%
was create a visual
introduction into a topic that

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.690 align:middle line:10%
looks at Saturn
worship as basically

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.450 align:middle line:10%
behind the origin of a
malevolent culture that

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.600 align:middle line:10%
exists in the world today.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.040 align:middle line:84%
It was designed to
be very, very low

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.870 align:middle line:84%
level to give people a basic
broad stroke, a brush stroke

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.400 align:middle line:84%
picture of how
Saturn theory works

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and linking that into a
lot of the standard sort

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.480 align:middle line:84%
of conspiracy, as some people
call it, ideas out there.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.080 align:middle line:84%
I particularly wanted
to link Saturn theory,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.040 align:middle line:84%
this new cosmology, to the--
basically the central banking

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.560 align:middle line:90%
model of international finance.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.420 align:middle line:84%
In terms of what we
find in Saturn theory,

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.910 align:middle line:84%
the archetypes, the
symbols that have come down

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.770 align:middle line:84%
through mythology, linked
back to their cosmology,

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.340 align:middle line:84%
are heavily influencing
a lot of what

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.470 align:middle line:84%
we see in the corporate
models, the central banking

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.140 align:middle line:84%
models, the debt-based
finance system as it stands.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.800 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to be-- it
was such a huge scope.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: You're literally
going from origins, almost

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.954 align:middle line:84%
human origins, right
to the modern day.

00:02:18.954 --> 00:02:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to give
a broad outline for people

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.620 align:middle line:90%
to follow.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And when I did the
website, it was

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.506 align:middle line:84%
to be done mostly as a visual
experience as much as I could.

00:02:28.506 --> 00:02:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's very
well done visually.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.870 align:middle line:90%
You have great artwork.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.240 align:middle line:84%
But also, it's a
wonderful tutorial.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Well, the subject
matter is so out there,

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.730 align:middle line:84%
so different from
mainstream thinking, that

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.500 align:middle line:84%
without the visual
aids-- and I think

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:84%
this is what's happened with the
hardcore researchers, the elder

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.820 align:middle line:84%
statesman of Saturn theory,
going back to Immanuel

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Velikovsky himself,
through guys like Talbott

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and Cardona-- some
of their stuff,

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.047 align:middle line:84%
it takes a huge time
investment to understand that.

00:03:04.047 --> 00:03:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you
compressed it beautifully.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.630 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.110 align:middle line:90%
A picture is worth 1,000 words.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.150 align:middle line:84%
You go away remembering
those images.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Well, that
was basically the aim.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And of course, what
those guys don't do--

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.460 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't want
to sort of-- I've

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.129 align:middle line:84%
never really been in contact
with them or anything

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:84%
along the lines of
discussions or anything.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.630 align:middle line:84%
I just absorbed what
they had to say.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.550 align:middle line:84%
But what I wanted
to do was marry that

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.310 align:middle line:84%
into how that affects our
culture, our civilization

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.710 align:middle line:84%
today, basically,
world cultures today

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:38.002 align:middle line:84%
as they are seen
to the modern eye.

00:03:38.002 --> 00:03:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And the one thing--

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.050 align:middle line:84%
We've done a couple
other interviews

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.010 align:middle line:84%
around the subject
of money, including

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.030 align:middle line:84%
one here in London,
which is interesting.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.170 align:middle line:84%
It's more a vibrational
look at archetypes

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.800 align:middle line:90%
and how we each relate to them.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And the saying she
kept mentioning

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.740 align:middle line:84%
was that the way
we are with money

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.690 align:middle line:84%
is the way we are
with our lives.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's so symbolically,
energetically

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.620 align:middle line:84%
representative of the levels of
fear, confidence, creativity,

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.700 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is that each of
us among humanity expresses.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:09.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Sure.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.949 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the
key things that I

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.990 align:middle line:84%
found when I was looking
into Saturn theory

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.170 align:middle line:84%
was that-- the idea
of the god Saturn

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.970 align:middle line:84%
is that he's the god of time
as much as any other aspect.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And what time is is time
is the first measure.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Once you are able to measure
the progress of time--

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, and we'll get to
that and how that started, too.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes, go ahead.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: But
that whole concept

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.870 align:middle line:84%
of measurements,
weights and measures,

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.150 align:middle line:84%
was so important in the
Saturn side of things.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And money is actually probably
the most important measure

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.974 align:middle line:84%
that we don't understand is a
measure in our society today.

00:04:51.974 --> 00:04:54.015 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand it
measures our productivity,

00:04:54.015 --> 00:04:57.720 align:middle line:84%
it measures our work, it
measures the price of our work.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.247 align:middle line:90%
And when that's manipulated--

00:04:59.247 --> 00:04:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.746 align:middle line:84%
When it's manipulated,
it measures the quality

00:05:01.746 --> 00:05:03.716 align:middle line:84%
of our internal
experience of life.

00:05:03.716 --> 00:05:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Yeah.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.250 align:middle line:84%
That's the way it's become,
for sure, in the modern day.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And a fair system-- to
quote a biblical concept,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.810 align:middle line:84%
"You shall have no diverse
weights and measures."

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:90%
This is a universal thing.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have fair
measures between all the strata

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.910 align:middle line:84%
of society so everybody knows
what they're dealing with when

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.510 align:middle line:90%
they interact with each other.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And that is possibly the
most distorted element

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.790 align:middle line:84%
that has been born out of
what I call the Saturn death

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.604 align:middle line:84%
culture that exists
in the world today.

00:05:42.604 --> 00:05:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, it's
certainly not life-giving.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.420 align:middle line:90%
We'll say that.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's start going back in
terms of our cosmology.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And start explaining
to us what Saturn once

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.220 align:middle line:84%
was to the Earth in
relationship to it.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And then take your
time explaining,

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.020 align:middle line:84%
under its influence, under even
the light factors, what life

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.820 align:middle line:84%
on Earth was like, what could
develop under that, what

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.860 align:middle line:84%
our plant life was
like, all of it.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.150 align:middle line:90%
You have the stage.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Well, in "Saturn
Death Cult," the website,

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:84%
the ebook I put
out, as I said, it

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.640 align:middle line:84%
was very visual, because
what you're doing

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.090 align:middle line:84%
is you're wrenching
people out of what seems

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.160 align:middle line:84%
to be almost an accepted idea
of how our solar system formed.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
uniformitarian idea,

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.720 align:middle line:84%
that things have really
changed slowly but surely

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.790 align:middle line:90%
over a 4 billion-year period.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.550 align:middle line:84%
What Saturn theory does is
it turns that mainstream

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.530 align:middle line:84%
view on its head,
and it basically

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.510 align:middle line:84%
says that the current
solar system is essentially

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.310 align:middle line:84%
a system that is born
of captured planets

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:53.010 align:middle line:84%
around the sun, Saturn being
the most recent captured

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.210 align:middle line:84%
celestial body into
orbit around the sun.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:01.450 align:middle line:84%
So you have a fruit salad
idea of the solar system,

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:84%
where objects are
arriving formed,

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.030 align:middle line:84%
they catastrophically rearrange
into what we see today.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is so at odds with
the uniformitarian science,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.270 align:middle line:84%
with the discretion model,
that for many people

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.520 align:middle line:90%
it's beyond comprehension.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:24.030 align:middle line:84%
How can you be-- how can that be
so wrong in mainstream science?

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And we're presenting
this what seems

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:32.320 align:middle line:84%
to be absurd idea of planets
that supposedly formed here

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.520 align:middle line:84%
over billions of years being
captured fairly recently.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.980 align:middle line:84%
The scary thing about the topic
is that when we say recently,

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.530 align:middle line:90%
we say, within human memory.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.385 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this
catastrophic rearrangement

00:07:45.385 --> 00:07:48.780 align:middle line:84%
of the planets, this capture,
particularly of Saturn,

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.770 align:middle line:84%
took place within
recorded human history.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
mythology represents.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And then Saturn theory,
we claim that mythology

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:07.450 align:middle line:84%
can be interpreted,
basically, as a record

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.720 align:middle line:84%
of actual celestial
events witnessed,

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.890 align:middle line:84%
rather than the madhouse
of imaginative thinking

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.442 align:middle line:84%
that modern scholarship
has created.

00:08:15.442 --> 00:08:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and also,
that would make sense

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.033 align:middle line:84%
as you're seeing repeated
things around the planet

00:08:19.033 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:84%
through various aboriginal
peoples and beyond.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.820 align:middle line:90%
So it's consistent imagery.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Well, comparative
mythology is the key to this.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.289 align:middle line:84%
You have a problem here
with the mainstream idea.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:34.909 align:middle line:84%
They refuse to believe
the idea that there

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:40.159 align:middle line:84%
was a worldwide civilization in
the past that possibly spread

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:84%
similar types of symbols, ideas,
archetypes through mythology.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And various,
very ancient iterations

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.520 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves, where we
had high intelligence,

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.222 align:middle line:90%
ability to travel, and so forth.

00:08:51.222 --> 00:08:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Yes.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And we can definitely
go down that line

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.080 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
electrostatic environment

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.260 align:middle line:84%
that Saturn produced
in these times,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.887 align:middle line:84%
because that's an area a lot of
people find very interesting.

00:09:01.887 --> 00:09:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I find it
interesting, and I

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:04.761 align:middle line:90%
would like you to go into that.

00:09:04.761 --> 00:09:06.170 align:middle line:90%
So where do we start, then?

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.360 align:middle line:90%
This is such a huge topic.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.901 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Well,
it starts, really,

00:09:08.901 --> 00:09:12.250 align:middle line:84%
with comparative mythology,
because what we have to look at

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:84%
is you've got similar archetypes
all the way through mythology.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.750 align:middle line:90%
And there are two explanations.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.405 align:middle line:84%
Either they all
saw the same thing

00:09:25.405 --> 00:09:26.880 align:middle line:84%
from different
parts of the world

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.460 align:middle line:84%
before they came into
contact with each other,

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:35.840 align:middle line:84%
or they were advised of
this by a missionary type

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.140 align:middle line:84%
program that went
around the world.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.670 align:middle line:84%
I would argue that there's
actually an element of both,

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:44.130 align:middle line:84%
that the event was observed
worldwide and so on,

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and that the archetypes
were installed,

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.320 align:middle line:84%
these catastrophic events
so scarred the psyche

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.570 align:middle line:84%
of the human species that they--
that there are-- that these

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.590 align:middle line:84%
archetypes that
they all have can

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.330 align:middle line:90%
be traced back to a single root.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, at
a period of time

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.760 align:middle line:84%
in the past that
has been lost, this

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:13.570 align:middle line:84%
was consolidated by the peoples
meeting up through the world

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.190 align:middle line:84%
as they came into--
it actually formed

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.842 align:middle line:84%
a connection of
something that existed.

00:10:18.842 --> 00:10:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And might
there have also

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.124 align:middle line:84%
been a type of
collective memory?

00:10:23.124 --> 00:10:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Yes,
most definitely.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.760 align:middle line:84%
This is what I
mean by the scarred

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.510 align:middle line:84%
psyche, a collective
memory that is passed down.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And you know, when
you're talking

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.105 align:middle line:84%
about these kinds of
catastrophic events,

00:10:35.105 --> 00:10:36.730 align:middle line:84%
what we're essentially
talking about is

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:40.160 align:middle line:84%
the one big archetype, which
is called a doomsday scenario,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.030 align:middle line:90%
or anxiety.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Doomsday anxiety exists all
over, throughout cultures.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.080 align:middle line:90%
It's what can be manipulated.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.490 align:middle line:84%
This is at the heart of
what is a Saturn Death Cult

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.450 align:middle line:84%
sort of idea, that
there are people

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.750 align:middle line:84%
who've learned to
manipulate this anxiety.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Once we realize that these
are based on natural events,

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:03.620 align:middle line:84%
and once, from our position
in the future, looking back,

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.950 align:middle line:84%
we can apply a scientific
sort of understanding

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:11.210 align:middle line:84%
of what transpired for
the people at the time,

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:84%
they only had their-- to
use that word-- intuitive

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:19.400 align:middle line:84%
understanding to record
events and to pass that down

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:24.440 align:middle line:84%
in posterity in various
forms to influence

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.960 align:middle line:84%
what was there as a
collective memory.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
beginning of priesthoods

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.700 align:middle line:90%
as far as these events happen.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.870 align:middle line:84%
The key, in terms of
the doomsday anxiety

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:40.570 align:middle line:84%
as an archetype, is
what caused the anxiety.

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And what is common to
virtually all cultures

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.290 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
world is this idea

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:52.430 align:middle line:84%
that something was happening
in the celestial north,

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.070 align:middle line:90%
above the Earth.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:12:00.300 align:middle line:84%
They pinpoint that region
of the world in mythology

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:10.390 align:middle line:84%
as an area where the primordial
god, the initiator of doomsday,

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:11.249 align:middle line:90%
came from.

00:12:11.249 --> 00:12:12.040 align:middle line:90%
They all have this.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.560 align:middle line:90%
They all have a version of this.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:18.900 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese have the great
yellow emperor set up there.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Mesoamerican societies
have oodles of this stuff.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And so what is
consistent is this idea

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:31.690 align:middle line:84%
of a stationary
force, a light, that

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.710 align:middle line:84%
bursts forth after
a period of darkness

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.790 align:middle line:84%
and basically kicks off
the whole ball of what

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:41.120 align:middle line:84%
becomes human civilization
in its various forms.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.920 align:middle line:90%
But they all point to that area.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.070 align:middle line:84%
The Nordics, we
all know that they

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:51.496 align:middle line:84%
point to north as their idea of
Valhalla and so on like that.

00:12:51.496 --> 00:12:57.120 align:middle line:84%
The most sacred part
of the Indus and so on

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:04.230 align:middle line:84%
is the part that actually
flows on a north-south line.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:05.880 align:middle line:84%
What's happened,
unfortunately, is

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:11.370 align:middle line:84%
that because there was
this obsession in mythology

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:14.710 align:middle line:84%
with this northern area, this
celestial northern region,

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.430 align:middle line:84%
which is where the pole
star can be seen today,

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:24.080 align:middle line:84%
what has happened is that
scholars have looked at this,

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.490 align:middle line:84%
and they've seen this
sort of insistence

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:30.320 align:middle line:84%
on this power, this light, that
has come from there, the star,

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:35.609 align:middle line:84%
basically, the sun, that once
shone up from those areas.

00:13:35.609 --> 00:13:37.650 align:middle line:84%
They look there today,
and there's nothing there.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't match what we see.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.200 align:middle line:84%
So the assumption
is that the ancients

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.750 align:middle line:90%
saw a very, very different sky--

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Than our
east-west orientation

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.320 align:middle line:90%
toward the sun, yes.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: --to
what we have today.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And because we don't
see that same sky,

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.050 align:middle line:84%
we assume they're
somehow making it up,

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:04.890 align:middle line:84%
that this is some kind of vast
imaginary collective psychosis

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:08.430 align:middle line:90%
that has come down through time.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Saturn's theory
actually says, no,

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:16.910 align:middle line:84%
that in fact that was the planet
Saturn at a period in Earth's

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:20.560 align:middle line:84%
past that actually
resided in that position

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:26.330 align:middle line:84%
in the Earth's celestial north,
that it burst into light,

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.280 align:middle line:84%
it brought light
into the world, it

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.300 align:middle line:84%
initiated what
became a golden age.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And then, when it was
dislodged by the appearance

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:43.290 align:middle line:84%
of a-- a before absent
sun and then a distant sun

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.050 align:middle line:90%
that came into it.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.400 align:middle line:84%
It was dislodged from that
position catastrophically.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.090 align:middle line:90%
That's your doomsday thing.

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:52.659 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is it-- for--
what I write in "Saturn Death

00:14:52.659 --> 00:14:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Cult," while there is a whole
cosmology that just looks

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:58.365 align:middle line:84%
at the science of this and looks
at how mythology records this

00:14:58.365 --> 00:15:01.220 align:middle line:84%
and what we can find in our
own scientific endeavors

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.940 align:middle line:84%
to match up with that, what
I've done in "Saturn Death Cult"

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:14.460 align:middle line:84%
is I've identified an
area of research that

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:18.000 align:middle line:84%
pinpoints a group of people,
a small elite, that basically

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.800 align:middle line:84%
have-- want to get back
to that golden age idea.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
you back up a bit,

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to have you
give some visual descriptions,

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.720 align:middle line:84%
because this was considered,
what, a brown dwarf star?

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.210 align:middle line:84%
At one time, you're saying,
this was, effectively,

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:34.900 align:middle line:90%
the light source for the planet?

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Yes.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.540 align:middle line:84%
In Saturn theory,
there is debate.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.820 align:middle line:84%
In all honesty, I
have to point out

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:45.180 align:middle line:84%
that there are people who
have different ideas about how

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:49.687 align:middle line:84%
Saturn got where it was in terms
of its relationship to Earth.

00:15:49.687 --> 00:15:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The way you're
depicting it there,

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:55.065 align:middle line:84%
it's almost in a binary
rotational system

00:15:55.065 --> 00:15:55.690 align:middle line:90%
with the Earth.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:56.398 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Yes.

00:15:56.398 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Basically, the-- what
we can all agree on

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:03.140 align:middle line:84%
is that Earth was a satellite
of Saturn at some point,

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.680 align:middle line:84%
when Saturn was what
is called-- what

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:09.220 align:middle line:84%
we know to be now
a sub-brown dwarf.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.710 align:middle line:84%
This is a-- in
mainstream thinking,

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.950 align:middle line:84%
a sub-brown dwarf is a star
that hasn't gone main sequence,

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:18.090 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have enough mass
to collapse in on itself

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:21.150 align:middle line:84%
and start-- initiate what
mainstream science says

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.960 align:middle line:90%
is what makes stars.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:28.130 align:middle line:84%
However, it is an object
that sheds its own light.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.290 align:middle line:84%
It has its own
radiation and so on.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.610 align:middle line:84%
It has its own
magnetosphere, which

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:36.940 align:middle line:84%
is these-- in
mainstream science,

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:41.936 align:middle line:84%
it's the radiation belts that
we find around these objects.

00:16:41.936 --> 00:16:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's a-- in its own
right, it is a star, as such.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.475 align:middle line:84%
Earth, we're saying
it was a satellite

00:16:53.475 --> 00:16:56.949 align:middle line:84%
of that star, which was
then captured by the sun.

00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:01.230 align:middle line:84%
So there is a plasma
sheath part of this story.

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:04.328 align:middle line:84%
There is the kind of light
that was cast off from Saturn

00:17:04.328 --> 00:17:06.369 align:middle line:84%
in your depiction of it
and in the artwork, which

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:07.224 align:middle line:90%
is fascinating.

00:17:07.224 --> 00:17:10.114 align:middle line:84%
I think you call it--
was it purple dawn?

00:17:10.114 --> 00:17:10.903 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Yes.

00:17:10.903 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so let's talk
about the nature of the light,

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:15.369 align:middle line:84%
the nature of the life,
and the life forms

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:17.260 align:middle line:84%
on the planet that
could even exist,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of what that
plasma supplied the planet,

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and the energetics
that would have allowed

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:25.349 align:middle line:84%
for a certain type of
foliage to even occur.

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:27.859 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Yes, absolutely.

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:31.220 align:middle line:84%
To do that, for people who--
so we don't lose people

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.170 align:middle line:84%
at this stage, this
is where we invoke

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.330 align:middle line:84%
what we call the
electric universe model.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:40.120 align:middle line:84%
This is a paradigm of
scientific understanding

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:44.380 align:middle line:84%
that rejects the gravity-only
of mainstream science,

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:48.030 align:middle line:84%
that the universe is
controlled entirely by gravity.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:52.959 align:middle line:84%
We reject black holes,
dark matter, dark energy,

00:17:52.959 --> 00:17:53.750 align:middle line:90%
that sort of thing.

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And we replace it
with that 95% that's

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:01.230 align:middle line:84%
missing in the calculations
of the gravity-driven model,

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:08.094 align:middle line:84%
we replace it with plasma
as the predominant material

00:18:08.094 --> 00:18:08.760 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Plasma is a great
conductor of electricity.

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:16.210 align:middle line:84%
It is the electromagnetic,
the electrostatic properties

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.960 align:middle line:84%
that are conducted through
plasma that really provide

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:25.120 align:middle line:84%
the forces that we are invoking
to explain what happens when

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:84%
you get a sub-brown
dwarf drifting

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.820 align:middle line:84%
into proximity with
a main sequence star.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.257 align:middle line:84%
Of course, this is so at
odds with mainstream science

00:18:35.257 --> 00:18:37.090 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of people
get lost at this point.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:38.465 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
let's talk about it

00:18:38.465 --> 00:18:40.406 align:middle line:84%
even from a mythological
point of view

00:18:40.406 --> 00:18:42.030 align:middle line:84%
and from other esoteric
points of view.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.840 align:middle line:84%
There was a time when
this planet was not

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.830 align:middle line:84%
bathed in the amount
of light it's in now.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Correct,
as far as we understand.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.575 align:middle line:84%
And certainly from a
mythological record,

00:18:50.575 --> 00:18:51.950 align:middle line:84%
there's a universal
understanding

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:55.570 align:middle line:84%
of a primordial darkness,
a time-- indeterminate time

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:57.010 align:middle line:90%
into the past.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:01.840 align:middle line:84%
It shattered when Saturn, in
whatever culture identified

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.370 align:middle line:90%
Saturn, bursts into light.

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:07.880 align:middle line:84%
But prior to that time, to use
something that a lot of people

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.586 align:middle line:84%
are very familiar with,
the biblical reference,

00:19:11.586 --> 00:19:16.340 align:middle line:84%
the spirit of the Lord hovered
on the celestial ocean,

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.680 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, and
so on, in darkness,

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.080 align:middle line:84%
before the "Let there
be light" moment that's

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.400 align:middle line:90%
what is described.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.250 align:middle line:90%
A lot of cultures talk of this.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And what you have is, if you've
got a terrestrial planet that

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.120 align:middle line:84%
is a satellite of
a sub-brown dwarf,

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.330 align:middle line:84%
in the electric universe
model, what happens

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:41.130 align:middle line:84%
is that the
electrical properties

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:46.760 align:middle line:84%
of the sub-brown dwarf
create this bubble that

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.800 align:middle line:84%
encases the core of
the sub-brown dwarf.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.970 align:middle line:84%
But between the bubble and the
core, the skin of the bubble,

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:56.710 align:middle line:84%
if you could imagine
that, there's

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:59.400 align:middle line:84%
a space, an area there,
where terrestrial planets

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.320 align:middle line:90%
can actually exist.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:09.780 align:middle line:84%
If we take Jupiter as a former
possible sub-brown dwarf star

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.390 align:middle line:84%
or something that is a size--
most sub-brown dwarf stars

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.080 align:middle line:90%
are about the size of Jupiter.

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.570 align:middle line:84%
It's down to their
mass rather than

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.450 align:middle line:84%
their volume that
differentiates them.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:22.270 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the four
terrestrial moons of Jupiter,

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:27.780 align:middle line:84%
they all exist inside this
radiation, basically a globe

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.800 align:middle line:90%
that exists around Jupiter.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.810 align:middle line:84%
That is what we
call plasmosphere

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:34.630 align:middle line:90%
in the electric universe model.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:38.320 align:middle line:90%
We know it exists with Jupiter.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:43.040 align:middle line:84%
We know it has a profound
influence on Jupiter's moons,

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:43.760 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And what we're saying is
that with sub-brown dwarfs,

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.060 align:middle line:90%
the same thing will happen.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And when you view
them from outside,

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:55.660 align:middle line:84%
you see the bubble, because
that plasma sheath, as it's

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.640 align:middle line:84%
called in the electric
universe model,

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.940 align:middle line:84%
is formed as a protective
layer, electrical layer,

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:06.670 align:middle line:84%
against the greater
galactic electrical field.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:84%
What that does is it
creates an opaque layer.

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.600 align:middle line:90%
So you can't see in.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.590 align:middle line:84%
You just see what seems
like a solid, cloudy body.

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:18.620 align:middle line:84%
But anything trapped between
that bubble and the core

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.820 align:middle line:90%
or whatever cannot see out.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:21.990 align:middle line:90%
No light gets into it.

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:26.120 align:middle line:84%
No light passes through
at that particular time.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.140 align:middle line:90%
There is, however, a dull glow.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:33.540 align:middle line:84%
There is enough light
frequencies given off

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:37.600 align:middle line:84%
by such an object that
if you existed in there,

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.175 align:middle line:84%
not only would you
sense a dull glow,

00:21:40.175 --> 00:21:43.570 align:middle line:84%
but it would be a
uniform dispersion.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: 24/7, except
there is no 24/7 yet.

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: The whole thing.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:46.705 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:21:46.705 --> 00:21:49.310 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, what this does--
if you can imagine somebody,

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:53.720 align:middle line:84%
you know, an astronaut
landed on such a satellite,

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:58.130 align:middle line:84%
or as we're postulating,
ancient humans existing

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:01.870 align:middle line:84%
in this environment when
Earth was trapped in there,

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:04.170 align:middle line:84%
you have nothing
to give you time.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:09.470 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing to allow
you to calculate time

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:12.711 align:middle line:84%
in any way whatsoever,
certainly not

00:22:12.711 --> 00:22:13.960 align:middle line:90%
beyond anything that is local.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not cyclically.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:15.070 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Exactly.

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:16.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
when I was reading

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.930 align:middle line:84%
through this part, of course,
my first question was, yes,

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.902 align:middle line:84%
but you don't have
photosynthesis,

00:22:21.902 --> 00:22:23.860 align:middle line:84%
you don't have enough
light for that, so how do

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.510 align:middle line:84%
you even have plant
life on the planet

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:27.710 align:middle line:84%
to sustain these animals
and these early humans?

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:28.770 align:middle line:90%
So please.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Well, the
photosynthesis thing

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:34.160 align:middle line:84%
has been a contention
for a lot of people

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:38.760 align:middle line:84%
who are critics of
this particular theory.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.610 align:middle line:84%
What we're saying is
that the sub-brown

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:46.670 align:middle line:84%
dwarf-- we now know
sub-brown dwarfs give off

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.080 align:middle line:84%
certain light frequencies
that do include infrared, do

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.860 align:middle line:90%
include ultraviolet.

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.610 align:middle line:84%
But basically, their
light frequency

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:58.620 align:middle line:84%
is the reddish to blue
sort of side of things.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.095 align:middle line:84%
If you're on a
terrestrial body that

00:23:01.095 --> 00:23:03.355 align:middle line:84%
has a magnetosphere--
that's what our Earth has

00:23:03.355 --> 00:23:06.570 align:middle line:84%
that sort of protects us from
radiation-- that magnetosphere

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:10.630 align:middle line:84%
and also its atmosphere
will produce,

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.280 align:middle line:90%
basically, a purplish hue.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:17.095 align:middle line:84%
And it's a dull
glow that is there.

00:23:17.095 --> 00:23:18.470 align:middle line:84%
There is enough
of that radiation

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:22.592 align:middle line:84%
coming from a sub-brown
dwarf to provide

00:23:22.592 --> 00:23:23.675 align:middle line:90%
that kind of illumination.

00:23:23.675 --> 00:23:26.016 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we'd have more
reddish types of plant life.

00:23:26.016 --> 00:23:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Yes,
because when it

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.510 align:middle line:84%
comes to plants, what
we know about plants

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:35.650 align:middle line:84%
is that they have a dormant
gene called retinol in them.

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And retinol is the-- it's
the parts of the plant that

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:50.810 align:middle line:84%
helps-- that loves to suck
in infrared to blue light

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:52.490 align:middle line:90%
spectrums and so on like that.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:54.230 align:middle line:84%
It's dormant at the
moment, because when

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:57.910 align:middle line:84%
the plants-- the chlorophyll
that we see in them now

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:01.230 align:middle line:84%
is really a reflective
device to regulate

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:04.960 align:middle line:84%
the amount of ultraviolet
light that hits the plant.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:09.030 align:middle line:84%
If you're not in a high
ultraviolet light environment,

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:13.390 align:middle line:84%
you actually want
to attract infrared,

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:15.850 align:middle line:84%
because it's the infrared
medium and so on that

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:18.300 align:middle line:90%
really is what the plant craves.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.380 align:middle line:84%
That's why all our
stuff is green today.

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:24.710 align:middle line:84%
It's actually saying
too much ultraviolet.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:30.230 align:middle line:84%
It's actually an
indication that, in terms

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:34.450 align:middle line:84%
of the evolutionary model,
it's an indication that plants

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:37.060 align:middle line:84%
weren't originally
designed for this,

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:39.290 align:middle line:84%
that they've had to go
into the chlorophyll--

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, all things adapt.

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:40.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: --sort of thing.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:41.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.893 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: It's an adaptation.

00:24:42.893 --> 00:24:44.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a later adaptation,
because retinol

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.740 align:middle line:84%
is by far the
older dormant gene.

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And this dormancy--
and we can see this,

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:55.560 align:middle line:84%
because if I can give
somebody an illustration,

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.394 align:middle line:84%
if you go to a certain
depth in the oceans--

00:24:57.394 --> 00:24:59.018 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just
thinking the same.

00:24:59.018 --> 00:25:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: --you are starting
to get the kind of environment

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.607 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about on
a terrestrial body, trapped.

00:25:04.607 --> 00:25:06.482 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The brownish
and reddish plant life

00:25:06.482 --> 00:25:06.930 align:middle line:90%
in the ocean, yes.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:07.638 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Yes.

00:25:07.638 --> 00:25:09.997 align:middle line:84%
All that seaweed
and so on like that.

00:25:09.997 --> 00:25:12.080 align:middle line:84%
As you get closer up, you
get your green seaweeds,

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.760 align:middle line:84%
as you get closer
to the surface.

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:19.727 align:middle line:90%
This shows how plants behave.

00:25:19.727 --> 00:25:21.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you are in
that twilight when you're

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:23.610 align:middle line:84%
underwater, until you
go down far enough

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:24.320 align:middle line:90%
and you're in no light.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Honestly, if
somebody really wanted to go

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:29.230 align:middle line:84%
and experience what it might
have been like to get an idea

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:30.090 align:middle line:90%
of the thing--

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dive.

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: --dive down into
those oceans, and you'll get--

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
what was striking me

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.380 align:middle line:84%
as I was looking at these
pictures and so forth.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:39.599 align:middle line:84%
So now, because we've got
so much ground to cover,

00:25:39.599 --> 00:25:41.140 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to
get into that a bit,

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.630 align:middle line:84%
about what life was like
at that time, perhaps.

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And so now, we start
moving forward.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.210 align:middle line:90%
What happened to Saturn?

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Why was it, so to
speak, banished?

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And the sun is now
the predominant theme.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about the
Silver Age, the Golden Age,

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.340 align:middle line:84%
and just lead us into
the body of the subject

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.620 align:middle line:90%
we'll be discussing.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Well, when you're
on the planet in relation

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.840 align:middle line:84%
to a star like
Saturn at the time,

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.284 align:middle line:84%
the first big noticeable
thing of there

00:26:09.284 --> 00:26:10.950 align:middle line:84%
is you have different
gravity, according

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:13.970 align:middle line:90%
to the electric universe model.

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:17.920 align:middle line:84%
A co-author of mine on a
recent book that I've done

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.090 align:middle line:84%
made his name in
basically showing

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:24.800 align:middle line:84%
that the massive fauna that
we've seen in the past,

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.870 align:middle line:84%
from mammoths going back to the
dinosaurs, this sort of thing

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:31.370 align:middle line:84%
couldn't have existed in the
gravity that we have today.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:32.560 align:middle line:90%
They simply would collapse.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
it's interesting,

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.224 align:middle line:84%
because there are giants
that are found, too,

00:26:35.224 --> 00:26:38.970 align:middle line:84%
that have been found with
bodies, perhaps, between 25

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:43.470 align:middle line:84%
and 35 feet tall with much
more porous bone density.

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.945 align:middle line:84%
I've even held one of the
occipital bones of one

00:26:45.945 --> 00:26:46.720 align:middle line:90%
of these.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.240 align:middle line:90%
It's much more porous than ours.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:52.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: It's a big problem
particularly for the dinosaur

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:54.074 align:middle line:84%
they study, because
they find him

00:26:54.074 --> 00:26:55.490 align:middle line:84%
even bigger and
bigger and bigger.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:56.430 align:middle line:90%
It's just kind of ridiculous.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And giant things
that were flying at the time

00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:58.640 align:middle line:90%
without jet propulsion.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.181 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: We know that when
the blue whale beaches itself,

00:27:01.181 --> 00:27:04.510 align:middle line:84%
it collapses under
its own weight.

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:07.550 align:middle line:84%
We know that they had--
10 million years ago,

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:12.160 align:middle line:84%
science tells us that they
had giant boa-like snakes.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.362 align:middle line:90%
They call them titanic boas.

00:27:14.362 --> 00:27:16.820 align:middle line:84%
They had to have been aquatic,
because they would have just

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.960 align:middle line:84%
collapsed under their own
weight and suffocated.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.626 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Unless there
were a difference

00:27:20.626 --> 00:27:23.050 align:middle line:84%
in the external or ambient
environment or gravity.

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:24.383 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Well, that's right.

00:27:24.383 --> 00:27:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And what we're saying is that
the electrostatic relationship

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.800 align:middle line:84%
between a sub-brown dwarf and
a terrestrial planet like Earth

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.880 align:middle line:84%
will actually
change the gravity;

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.150 align:middle line:90%
you'll get a different gravity.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, to answer your question,
when you-- in a system

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.700 align:middle line:84%
like this, you have no
idea what's out there,

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:44.380 align:middle line:84%
you only have this dull thing
that doesn't move at the top,

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:50.150 align:middle line:84%
because either you're in a phase
lock situation with the star,

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:53.410 align:middle line:84%
like the moon is with the Earth,
or you're in what we propagate,

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:58.770 align:middle line:84%
which is an axial-aligned
polar configuration.

00:27:58.770 --> 00:27:59.555 align:middle line:90%
But in any case--

00:27:59.555 --> 00:28:01.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
very static reality.

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:02.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Yeah.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.049 align:middle line:84%
There's just nothing
there to grasp hold of.

00:28:05.049 --> 00:28:06.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To gauge anything by.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN:
Everything is nebulous

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.060 align:middle line:90%
and changing all the time.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.120 align:middle line:90%
There's no continuity.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.037 align:middle line:90%
There's no regulation.

00:28:13.037 --> 00:28:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now
let's talk about what

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:16.834 align:middle line:84%
happens to Saturn when the
sun takes its position.

00:28:16.834 --> 00:28:18.375 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Well,
that plasma bubble

00:28:18.375 --> 00:28:20.670 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking
about, the sun has one.

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.240 align:middle line:90%
It's called the heliosphere.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.805 align:middle line:84%
And it's massive in comparison
to a sub-brown dwarf's.

00:28:25.805 --> 00:28:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
these two bubbles that

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:30.560 align:middle line:84%
start to drift
towards each other,

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.730 align:middle line:84%
you're essentially going to
get an electrical reaction,

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:37.310 align:middle line:84%
because they're electrically
driven, according

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:38.810 align:middle line:90%
to the electric universe model.

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:42.010 align:middle line:90%


00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:48.050 align:middle line:84%
The problem here for Saturn
is that it is positively

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:51.300 align:middle line:84%
charged to Earth in
the electric sense,

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:55.290 align:middle line:84%
but it's negatively
charged to the sun.

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:56.690 align:middle line:90%
The sun is a lot more powerful.

00:28:56.690 --> 00:29:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And when its electrical field--
because that's all the plasma

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:04.560 align:middle line:84%
sheath actually is-- touches
with the electrical field

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.220 align:middle line:84%
of a larger object--
the sun, in this case--

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:09.320 align:middle line:90%
you get a short-circuiting.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, that stuff that we
were talking about before,

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.594 align:middle line:84%
plasma, it exists in currents
between celestial bodies.

00:29:17.594 --> 00:29:19.010 align:middle line:84%
They're called
Birkeland currents.

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:22.119 align:middle line:84%
They were discovered over
100 years ago now by--

00:29:22.119 --> 00:29:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you illustrate
this in the book, as well,

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and the way ancients
may have depicted it,

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.610 align:middle line:84%
what they were actually
trying to show us

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:29.930 align:middle line:90%
about the cosmology of the day.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:30.640 align:middle line:90%
It's brilliant.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Yeah.

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:35.425 align:middle line:84%
And to jump to that, Jacob's
Ladder, the primordial tree

00:29:35.425 --> 00:29:42.120 align:middle line:84%
of life, these chains or spears
that go up into the heaven,

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:45.810 align:middle line:84%
the stairway to heaven-- all
these archetypes are linked

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:52.390 align:middle line:84%
to this grand cosmic current
that, when Saturn is excited

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:57.070 align:middle line:84%
electrically, will go from
virtually invisible, which we

00:29:57.070 --> 00:30:01.120 align:middle line:84%
call dark mode, it'll
go into glow mode.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.549 align:middle line:84%
And when it really gets hit by
a powerful electrical source--

00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like the heliosphere.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: --like
the heliosphere,

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.560 align:middle line:90%
it'll go into arc mode.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.357 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's quite an
amazing thing to see,

00:30:11.357 --> 00:30:13.190 align:middle line:84%
and it would be probably
the most dangerous.

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:14.731 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, and
you show that you

00:30:14.731 --> 00:30:17.380 align:middle line:10%
have this depiction of the
people of the day-- what?

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.530 align:middle line:10%
Blinded by the light.

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:20.030 align:middle line:10%
>>MCLACHLAN: Well,
that's the thing.

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:23.600 align:middle line:10%
What we're talking about here
is that in coming into contact

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:31.380 align:middle line:10%
with the heliosphere of the
sun, Saturn virtually goes nova.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, tying it back
to your mythology,

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.220 align:middle line:84%
this is the "Let
there be light" moment

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:38.190 align:middle line:84%
that most cultures
actually talk about.

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:41.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a sudden bursting
forth of Saturn's power,

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.230 align:middle line:84%
because from the
Earth's perspective,

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:47.140 align:middle line:84%
they don't know it's
the sun doing this.

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.777 align:middle line:84%
All that happens to them is
that suddenly this dull object--

00:30:50.777 --> 00:30:51.402 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Boom.

00:30:51.402 --> 00:30:51.902 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:51.902 --> 00:30:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: --just bursts forth
in absolute brilliant light

00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:00.335 align:middle line:84%
and proceeds to bathe
in a radiance that

00:31:00.335 --> 00:31:01.850 align:middle line:90%
has never been seen before.

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:04.229 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I can't imagine
that people could have even--

00:31:04.229 --> 00:31:05.270 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Survived it.

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:06.269 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --survived it.

00:31:06.269 --> 00:31:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Catastrophic,
beyond belief.

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:09.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And animals, yes.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: And yet, it seems
to have triggered within humans

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.710 align:middle line:84%
a sudden realization--
hey, I can see things

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:20.180 align:middle line:90%
a little bit differently now.

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:21.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now we're
going to jump forward.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.263 align:middle line:84%
Now they're seeing
things differently.

00:31:23.263 --> 00:31:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, at what point are we now
under the influence of the sun?

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Saturn's out there,
but Saturn is still--

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.065 align:middle line:84%
the remnant of Saturn,
the Silver and Golden age,

00:31:32.065 --> 00:31:34.600 align:middle line:84%
are still affecting
the psychology

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.005 align:middle line:90%
and the desires of the people.

00:31:36.005 --> 00:31:37.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Well,
that Birkeland

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:41.230 align:middle line:84%
current that is connected
between Earth and Saturn,

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:44.180 align:middle line:84%
it's basically an
umbilical cord.

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's been
put under strain.

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.910 align:middle line:84%
It's basically being
overloaded, if you

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:52.870 align:middle line:84%
can put it in pure
electrical terms.

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And the result is is that
Saturn is really under stress.

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:01.170 align:middle line:84%
It looks beautiful,
it's bathing the world,

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:03.860 align:middle line:84%
the survivors are into this
new-- bright, new world,

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:04.810 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:07.120 align:middle line:84%
What also happens is
that that plasmosphere,

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.090 align:middle line:84%
the big bubble, it
goes transparent.

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:11.580 align:middle line:90%
It's no longer opaque.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.400 align:middle line:84%
This is why, for instance,
in the biblical account,

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:20.720 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the fourth day--
the third day that the-- it's

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.637 align:middle line:84%
mentioned that the stars
and the sun were made,

00:32:23.637 --> 00:32:25.220 align:middle line:84%
which is at odds
with the whole thing.

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:25.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.350 align:middle line:90%
It means that they were visible.

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Yes, basically.

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that concept
of looking out and seeing

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:35.702 align:middle line:84%
the greater cosmos
was probably one

00:32:35.702 --> 00:32:36.910 align:middle line:90%
of the most profound moments.

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:38.326 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What an
altered reality.

00:32:38.326 --> 00:32:38.970 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:42.720 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: I tend to
believe that this is really

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:43.970 align:middle line:90%
what the Golden Age was about.

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:46.850 align:middle line:84%
It was a time of-- a lot of
people think of the Golden Age

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:51.070 align:middle line:84%
as a paradise of doing
nothing, an endless Sunday,

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:52.600 align:middle line:90%
lazing around.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.870 align:middle line:84%
But basically, it seems
to me the Golden Age

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:59.190 align:middle line:90%
was a period of great discovery.

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And it was great discovery
because the environment

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:07.220 align:middle line:84%
that Saturn originally had
provided an eternal harvest.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So people did not have to
worry about food, really.

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:13.072 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't the preoccupation
with dealing with seasons.

00:33:13.072 --> 00:33:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
because there were none.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:15.570 align:middle line:90%
It was just consistent.

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: There were none.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And this food would
just come forward.

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:20.470 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't have that worry.

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Quite literally, it was
there for the taking,

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:23.920 align:middle line:90%
and they could get on with it.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.560 align:middle line:90%
And what could they get on with?

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Measuring their newfound cosmos.

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:33.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the measuring that
is what brings forth

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:36.300 align:middle line:84%
civilization and
this Golden Age.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.920 align:middle line:84%
I personally am of
the opinion this

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:42.315 align:middle line:84%
is when Atlantis
came into being.

00:33:42.315 --> 00:33:46.680 align:middle line:84%
The legends that
result go back to that.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the
situation, this idea

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:54.350 align:middle line:84%
of being able to measure
one's environment

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:58.130 align:middle line:84%
was profoundly affected by these
new stars that could be seen

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and this one
particular star that

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:03.900 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be revolving
around at distance.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.970 align:middle line:84%
In mythology, we
talk about the period

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:10.120 align:middle line:84%
where there was the absent sun,
then there is the distant sun.

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And it gets closer,
and it gets closer.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.530 align:middle line:84%
What they couldn't
have known at that time

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:19.679 align:middle line:84%
was that that was what was
going to effectively push

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:23.249 align:middle line:84%
Saturn from its now glorious
position, where it was

00:34:23.249 --> 00:34:28.300 align:middle line:84%
this radiant body, bathing the
Earth in this celestial light.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.449 align:middle line:84%
And from that, of course,
mythology gives us

00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:36.909 align:middle line:84%
the story of the regicide
practiced by Jupiter.

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:39.989 align:middle line:84%
And when we take
Greek mythology,

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:45.320 align:middle line:84%
it's Zeus, the son of
Kronos, who was Saturn,

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:49.880 align:middle line:84%
coming forth and killing his
father and displacing him.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:53.489 align:middle line:84%
You can already start to see
where the malevolent influences

00:34:53.489 --> 00:34:54.469 align:middle line:90%
in human psychology--

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:55.969 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
yes, and then we are

00:34:55.969 --> 00:34:57.910 align:middle line:84%
going to get into
cataclysmic eras.

00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
we have to look

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:02.180 align:middle line:84%
at how people deal
with that information.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.530 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Sure.

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the aspects that
the sun is bringing with it

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:12.990 align:middle line:84%
that they could not have known,
one of the aspects that we can

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:15.240 align:middle line:84%
look at is that it's
also bringing with it

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.970 align:middle line:84%
a pretty large object called
Jupiter, the planet Jupiter.

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably the planet
Jupiter, before the sun

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:28.740 align:middle line:84%
itself, that Saturn first starts
to have serious problems with.

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's that pressure of being
captured, as we view it today,

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:39.660 align:middle line:84%
that eventually knocks
Saturn from its perch,

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:44.030 align:middle line:84%
where mythology gives
the King in the North,

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:48.610 align:middle line:84%
this splendid body-- it's
now a pinprick that can just

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:50.450 align:middle line:84%
be picked out by
the naked eye today.

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:52.280 align:middle line:84%
We can't see its
rings, yet the ancients

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.700 align:middle line:90%
seemed to know about them.

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.680 align:middle line:84%
The ancients knew
Jupiter had rings.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:01.470 align:middle line:84%
One of the great
opportunities missed

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:04.820 align:middle line:84%
by people in Saturn theory was
they had it there before them.

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.450 align:middle line:84%
The ancients had put
rings around Jupiter.

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:09.060 align:middle line:90%
We could've--

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.055 align:middle line:84%
The researchers
of that time could

00:36:11.055 --> 00:36:13.880 align:middle line:84%
have predicted rings would have
been found around Jupiter way

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.300 align:middle line:90%
before they actually were.

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.510 align:middle line:90%
How did the ancients know this?

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:19.720 align:middle line:84%
It's because they were
in much closer proximity.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And they witnessed
these battles.

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:24.740 align:middle line:84%
We haven't even gone
into the role of Mars,

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.070 align:middle line:84%
the role of Venus, all
these things that--

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:28.695 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because we
don't have I know.

00:36:28.695 --> 00:36:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And again, if people go to
the website and read this,

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:37.930 align:middle line:84%
it's wonderfully chronological
in the way you've laid it out.

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:40.006 align:middle line:84%
And the imagery,
again, is beautifully

00:36:40.006 --> 00:36:40.880 align:middle line:90%
supportive of it all.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.740 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to say
we're skipping parts,

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:46.360 align:middle line:84%
because we want to
get into, ultimately,

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.970 align:middle line:84%
how this influence of
Saturn being banished,

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:51.450 align:middle line:84%
cataclysms that have
occurred, and so forth,

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:54.390 align:middle line:84%
allow us to be manipulated
all the way to today.

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: When we
get to that Golden Age,

00:36:56.510 --> 00:37:00.860 align:middle line:84%
we've got a period
of, I maintain,

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:04.070 align:middle line:84%
great discovery,
people discovering

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:07.280 align:middle line:84%
how to measure their
environment and so on.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.120 align:middle line:84%
When you get the
loss of Saturn, which

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.620 align:middle line:84%
is a cata-- we'll skip
over the details of how

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:15.550 align:middle line:84%
out happens-- but basically,
that whole alignment,

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Earth, Saturn, Mars and Venus
were also included in that.

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.610 align:middle line:84%
But it gets torn apart and
rearranged in such ways.

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:28.110 align:middle line:84%
We get severed from Saturn,
ourselves, here on Earth.

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And the catastrophic
rearrangement

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:35.890 align:middle line:84%
produced such horrors,
such destruction

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:42.410 align:middle line:84%
on this-- on the planet that
we never quite got over it.

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:46.070 align:middle line:84%
It's that collective memory that
we were talking about earlier.

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:49.590 align:middle line:84%
It comes from that
loss of Saturn.

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.040 align:middle line:84%
Where we start to
get into the idea

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:58.090 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
manipulation taking place

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:02.760 align:middle line:84%
is that when you have the
survivors bringing their heads

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:07.490 align:middle line:84%
up above the parapets after
this great destructive event,

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:11.310 align:middle line:84%
there's obviously a yearning
to go back to that Golden Age.

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:15.710 align:middle line:84%
For some people, they recognize
that the civilizing influence

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:20.200 align:middle line:84%
of weights, measures,
all these things that

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.350 align:middle line:84%
were born of Saturn
bursting forth into light,

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:28.410 align:middle line:84%
is the key to maintaining
some kind of connection

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:30.470 align:middle line:90%
with the Golden Age.

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:33.940 align:middle line:84%
However, there are people who
just simply see the Golden Age

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:41.130 align:middle line:84%
as a lifestyle that allows
them to live a certain way.

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And without the eternal
harvest that Saturn

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:48.950 align:middle line:84%
used to bring when it was
the God in the North--

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:52.710 align:middle line:84%
without that, you
now have a period

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:58.480 align:middle line:84%
of-- there's a
"waste not, want not"

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.480 align:middle line:84%
mentality that has to be
born into the human species.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.630 align:middle line:90%
They have to prepare.

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:05.020 align:middle line:84%
They have to learn
how to store food--

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.381 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To deal with the
cyclical nature of life.

00:39:07.381 --> 00:39:08.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Of life as it is.

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: You've
now got the sun--

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.041 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have plenty,
then you have nothing.

00:39:12.041 --> 00:39:13.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's a completely
different way

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:16.340 align:middle line:84%
of thinking than
always abundance.

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: That's right.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.060 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly it.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:23.140 align:middle line:84%
It's just that some
people want that life

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:25.080 align:middle line:90%
of absolute abundance.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And the penny drops with
them, that these other people

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:36.630 align:middle line:84%
can be manipulated
in certain ways.

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:41.230 align:middle line:84%
First, threats of violence
is the obvious one, tribe

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:44.750 align:middle line:84%
against tribe, that sort of
thing, one dominating others.

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:48.750 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of distorting
those measures taken out

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:53.230 align:middle line:84%
of the Golden Age is
probably the most subtle form

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:54.280 align:middle line:90%
of dominating people.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is where "Saturn
Death Cult" introduces the idea

00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:04.300 align:middle line:84%
that the distortion of the
memories of the Golden Age

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:08.900 align:middle line:84%
are centered around the
productive capacity of people

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.935 align:middle line:84%
and the measures used to measure
those productive capacities.

00:40:11.935 --> 00:40:12.476 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:40:12.476 --> 00:40:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Now let's get into
the emotional factors.

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And let's get into
the notion of the gods

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:21.450 align:middle line:84%
and outside entities and
punishment and so on so

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:25.200 align:middle line:84%
we can see how, then, we started
succumbing to manipulations

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.530 align:middle line:84%
that were now being carried
out by human beings that

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:30.610 align:middle line:84%
have their own agenda of
trying to please the gods,

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:32.040 align:middle line:90%
return to the Golden Age.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.956 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Well, you
certainly have a period

00:40:33.956 --> 00:40:36.940 align:middle line:84%
from, let's say, the fall of the
Golden Age, the fall of Saturn,

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:41.170 align:middle line:84%
you certainly have
a period of time

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:46.910 align:middle line:84%
where some researchers take
it up as recent as 600 BC,

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:50.170 align:middle line:84%
where the rearrangement
of the planets

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:53.620 align:middle line:84%
is a huge source of discomfort
for people on Earth.

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:56.840 align:middle line:84%
You've got these objects
that are rearranging,

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.840 align:middle line:84%
planetary-sized things, they're
colliding with each other out

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.402 align:middle line:84%
in space, they're creating light
shows you wouldn't believe--

00:41:02.402 --> 00:41:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Deluges, all of it.

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: They're
coming close to us.

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:08.520 align:middle line:84%
All these kinds of little
disasters and so on.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.350 align:middle line:84%
The priesthoods
exist to basically--

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:13.485 align:middle line:90%


00:41:13.485 --> 00:41:15.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Quell the
fear of the masses?

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:17.276 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: --help people
understand these things--

00:41:17.276 --> 00:41:20.310 align:middle line:84%
exactly, yes-- while at the
same time searching for that way

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:23.090 align:middle line:90%
to create a golden age.

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:26.440 align:middle line:84%
That fear, that
doomsday anxiety,

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:30.380 align:middle line:84%
means that those people
who have an understanding

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:33.850 align:middle line:84%
of these things have an
advantage of knowledge

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:39.670 align:middle line:84%
that the average
person ultimately

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:42.050 align:middle line:90%
gives them control over.

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because there's
just a vague fear,

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:47.140 align:middle line:84%
and it's been passed off to
the activities of the gods,

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.110 align:middle line:84%
punishment and so
forth, through what

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:51.460 align:middle line:84%
has been developed by
the very ones in control.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:51.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Sure.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And the priesthoods
become the means

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:59.519 align:middle line:84%
by which-- they become
the means of defining

00:41:59.519 --> 00:42:02.060 align:middle line:84%
what was in the past, what is
happening, and so on like that.

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.060 align:middle line:90%
It gives them immense power.

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:05.960 align:middle line:84%
But there's always
this productive side

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:10.020 align:middle line:84%
of things that needs
to be controlled.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And for those who would
wish to live a Golden Age

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:16.340 align:middle line:84%
lifestyle at the
expense of others,

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:20.710 align:middle line:84%
this is where this concept
of Saturn death cult,

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:24.140 align:middle line:84%
this culture of
manipulating those fear

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:27.399 align:middle line:84%
symbols, those things that
made people frightened,

00:42:27.399 --> 00:42:29.815 align:middle line:84%
comes into play, because what
it does, if you have control

00:42:29.815 --> 00:42:32.720 align:middle line:84%
of that, if you have those
symbols on your side,

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:36.830 align:middle line:84%
they kind of justify your
position of authority.

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's from there that we
move into the modern era.

00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about the priest kings

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:45.910 align:middle line:84%
and then move into
more modern times.

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:48.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: OK, well, I
have to say, because of--

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:49.753 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, do.

00:42:49.753 --> 00:42:53.444 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: --who, you
know, who's-- you know--

00:42:53.444 --> 00:42:54.860 align:middle line:84%
in conjunction
with sort of having

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:56.109 align:middle line:90%
this interview with and so on.

00:42:56.109 --> 00:43:02.260 align:middle line:84%
But the penny dropped for me
when I read Jay Weidner's work

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:03.785 align:middle line:90%
on Stanley Kubrick.

00:43:03.785 --> 00:43:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:06.553 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Yeah, I was
looking at priests kings.

00:43:06.553 --> 00:43:10.740 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at all these sorts
of ideas that came through.

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:17.290 align:middle line:84%
But when Jay revealed-- I
never knew Kubrick, in "2001,"

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:22.000 align:middle line:84%
had wanted to use Saturn
instead of Jupiter

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.180 align:middle line:90%
as the destination in the film.

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And once I got a
hold and started

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:28.980 align:middle line:84%
to understand that Jay
was explaining "2001"

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:33.460 align:middle line:84%
as a alchemical initiation
and that Kubrick seemed

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:37.050 align:middle line:84%
to have some kind of
understanding of what

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:42.160 align:middle line:84%
the elite of the
world had in terms

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.052 align:middle line:84%
of alchemical knowledge,
this sort of thing--

00:43:45.052 --> 00:43:46.510 align:middle line:84%
when he linked it
to Saturn, that's

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:49.740 align:middle line:84%
when the penny dropped for
me as to the modern age

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:53.700 align:middle line:84%
and the priest kings,
where the links come

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:57.700 align:middle line:84%
from those ancient
periods to today,

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.260 align:middle line:90%
what drives the modern links.

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So once
the penny dropped,

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:03.740 align:middle line:84%
talk about the path
it took you down.

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Well,
I had always been

00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:09.420 align:middle line:84%
aware that there was
something malevolent

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:12.720 align:middle line:84%
in the central banking
model of finance,

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:16.540 align:middle line:84%
because money being the
measure that it is, linked back

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.780 align:middle line:84%
to what came out
of the Golden Age

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:23.290 align:middle line:84%
and so on, debt-based
financing is

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:26.950 align:middle line:84%
a false measure,
pure and simple.

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:32.365 align:middle line:84%
It puts people into
debt through no laziness

00:44:32.365 --> 00:44:33.860 align:middle line:90%
on their part or whatever.

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:35.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
false sense of value.

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:37.361 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: A false
sense of value, and it

00:44:37.361 --> 00:44:39.530 align:middle line:84%
puts people into
debt with those who

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:43.380 align:middle line:84%
have the power to
issue and coin money.

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:45.980 align:middle line:84%
So I'd always been aware
of that side of things.

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:51.150 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of conspiracy theory
with its ideas about its links

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:55.080 align:middle line:84%
back into occult thinking, that
kind of thing, while some of it

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:58.070 align:middle line:84%
is probably quite
valid, it didn't quite

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:02.920 align:middle line:84%
take back to why this
is such an ancient dream

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.097 align:middle line:84%
on the part of the
elites to do this.

00:45:05.097 --> 00:45:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To return
to the Golden Age?

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:07.388 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Yes.

00:45:07.388 --> 00:45:08.037 align:middle line:90%
This was it.

00:45:08.037 --> 00:45:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At the expense
of everyone else, though.

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.440 align:middle line:84%
This is not holistic
thinking at this point.

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: And of course,
what it was was once

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:20.020 align:middle line:84%
I read Jay's understanding
of what Star-Child in "2001"

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:24.480 align:middle line:84%
represented, that
evolutionary leap,

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:28.530 align:middle line:84%
that's your Golden
Age mentality being

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:30.500 align:middle line:90%
expressed in a different way.

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:34.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the genius of
Kubrick, initiating us

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:38.100 align:middle line:84%
into understanding
where it all comes from.

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:43.590 align:middle line:84%
It's precisely this desire to
create a man-made golden age

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:47.100 align:middle line:84%
for themselves, to recreate
this man-made golden age.

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:52.470 align:middle line:84%
The trouble is, when Saturn
gave the power to the Earth

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:56.470 align:middle line:84%
to keep us all in a golden
age, because it was glowing,

00:45:56.470 --> 00:46:01.220 align:middle line:84%
giving us this wonderful harvest
and so on, the elite today

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:02.430 align:middle line:90%
don't have that.

00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:05.320 align:middle line:84%
All they can do is
harness the masses.

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to say,
it's an inorganic thought,

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:10.030 align:middle line:84%
totally lacking in wisdoms
because it's-- wisdom--

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:12.265 align:middle line:84%
it's not in alignment
with what once was.

00:46:12.265 --> 00:46:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: And this is where
you get your transhumanist

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:20.530 align:middle line:84%
agenda, you get your
desire to manipulate genes.

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:23.160 align:middle line:90%


00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:26.090 align:middle line:84%
Basically, technology
becomes the mechanism

00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:33.325 align:middle line:84%
where they-- towards their
idea of heaven for themselves.

00:46:33.325 --> 00:46:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can we
hopscotch a little bit

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:36.590 align:middle line:84%
through more modern
history and how

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:39.890 align:middle line:84%
this started showing itself
and strengthening itself

00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:43.500 align:middle line:84%
to get exactly where you are
right now, even maybe starting

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.460 align:middle line:84%
in the Roman times and
going through to today?

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Well, yeah.

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:54.800 align:middle line:84%
In looking at the-- looking
at the financial model,

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:59.390 align:middle line:84%
I identify the financial
system as something

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:04.200 align:middle line:84%
that keeps being introduced over
a period of time in history.

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:08.200 align:middle line:84%
I can count at least three
definite historical documented

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:12.420 align:middle line:84%
times where we've been
brought to catastrophe

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:17.780 align:middle line:84%
on a financial level that
has created some of the worst

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:19.570 align:middle line:90%
moments in human history.

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:22.690 align:middle line:84%
The original one, which is
what a lot of people refer

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:25.890 align:middle line:84%
to as the Tower of Babel
moment-- or "Bay-bel,"

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:28.050 align:middle line:84%
however people want
to pronounce that.

00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:32.190 align:middle line:84%
To me, that is your
first man-made disaster

00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:37.180 align:middle line:84%
in the act of basically
creating a economic system based

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:39.145 align:middle line:90%
on debt-based financing.

00:47:39.145 --> 00:47:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
is bound to fail.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: That collapsed.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:41.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:42.640 align:middle line:90%
It collapses in on itself.

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.820 align:middle line:84%
It always gets so big, it
collapses in on itself.

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:47.850 align:middle line:84%
It becomes confused, because
it's using false measures,

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:51.390 align:middle line:90%
it's using false weights.

00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:55.945 align:middle line:84%
In Roman times, I would
identify the crisis of AD 33.

00:47:55.945 --> 00:48:00.020 align:middle line:90%


00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Tiberius was
emperor at the time.

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Jesus Christ is said to have
been executed at that time.

00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:10.440 align:middle line:84%
What a lot of people
don't realize at that time

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:14.560 align:middle line:84%
was Rome went through a
profound financial crisis, which

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:16.870 align:middle line:84%
resulted in something
that is absolutely unique.

00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:middle line:84%
It's part of some
of the research

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing at the moment.

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Tiberius became the first ever
king leader, guy in charge,

00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:31.750 align:middle line:84%
to actually give away
his entire wealth

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:34.047 align:middle line:84%
to save his people
from financial crisis.

00:48:34.047 --> 00:48:36.130 align:middle line:84%
It would be the equivalent
to the Queen of England

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:38.660 align:middle line:84%
cashing in her $40 billion,
$400 billion, whatever she has--

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And distributing
it around the planet.

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:41.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: and
distributing it around

00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:43.400 align:middle line:84%
to save us from the
current financial system.

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: That's
what Tiberius did.

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:46.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
even-- and some documents

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:50.160 align:middle line:84%
argue that Jesus,
in his lifetime,

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.440 align:middle line:84%
as an activist against the
bank and the banking industry

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.720 align:middle line:84%
itself, that was partly
what would have gotten him

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:56.640 align:middle line:90%
into that situation.

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: I'm
convinced of it.

00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:58.996 align:middle line:90%
I'm absolutely convinced of it.

00:48:58.996 --> 00:49:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And research-- I won't go
into great depth and so on,

00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:06.890 align:middle line:84%
but there is a known story of
the house of Malchus, which

00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:13.150 align:middle line:84%
was a Tyrian purple dying
company in the city of Tyre

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:20.140 align:middle line:84%
that essentially suffered
a default on loans that

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.110 align:middle line:84%
precipitated, over
the next seven years,

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:24.490 align:middle line:90%
the crisis leading up to AD 33.

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:28.420 align:middle line:84%
That period where they
suffer their default

00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:33.280 align:middle line:84%
is in exact alignment
with what would

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:36.512 align:middle line:84%
have been the Jewish
Jubilee release period.

00:49:36.512 --> 00:49:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, talk about the
Jewish Jubilee release period.

00:49:38.970 --> 00:49:41.386 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Well, that's the
opposite of the Saturn death

00:49:41.386 --> 00:49:43.320 align:middle line:90%
cult financial model.

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:48.892 align:middle line:84%
It's not exclusive to Jewish
history, Isrealitish history.

00:49:48.892 --> 00:49:51.350 align:middle line:84%
It's something that's practiced
throughout the Middle East.

00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's it
characterized by?

00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:54.521 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: It's
characterized by, simply,

00:49:54.521 --> 00:49:59.088 align:middle line:84%
forgiveness of all debt at
a particular period in time.

00:49:59.088 --> 00:50:02.397 align:middle line:84%
In the biblical law,
it's every 49 years.

00:50:02.397 --> 00:50:03.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:06.104 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: It's actually every
seven years, you cancel debts.

00:50:06.104 --> 00:50:10.409 align:middle line:84%
But every 49 years, everything
goes back to its original set.

00:50:10.409 --> 00:50:12.575 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and even
today, in the Islamic model

00:50:12.575 --> 00:50:15.050 align:middle line:84%
of banking, there is no
interest charges-- flat fee

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:17.080 align:middle line:84%
for a transaction and
no interest, right?

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Well, in
the Israelite system,

00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:20.110 align:middle line:84%
there certainly
wouldn't be any interest

00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:22.880 align:middle line:90%
charged within the system.

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:27.120 align:middle line:84%
The Persians,
their version of it

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:29.855 align:middle line:84%
was whenever a
king came to power,

00:50:29.855 --> 00:50:30.980 align:middle line:90%
whenever you got a change--

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:32.355 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then
debt was absolved.

00:50:32.355 --> 00:50:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: So, yeah,
if he lasted five years,

00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:36.290 align:middle line:90%
on his death, Jubilee.

00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:39.210 align:middle line:84%
If the next one lasted 50 years,
that's when the next Jubilee.

00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wouldn't
it be nice if it

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:41.541 align:middle line:84%
were the election of
each new president.

00:50:41.541 --> 00:50:43.425 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Yes.

00:50:43.425 --> 00:50:44.410 align:middle line:90%
And congressman.

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And congressman.

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:47.060 align:middle line:90%
Better yet, every two years.

00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:47.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.210 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Every time
we have an election.

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now, that's
not happening anymore.

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:52.810 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what happened forward.

00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Well, you see,
it's-- cancellation of debt is

00:50:56.690 --> 00:51:00.190 align:middle line:84%
the absolute antithesis of
what is being trying to achieve

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:02.860 align:middle line:84%
by a debt-based
financial system.

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:04.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: The
last thing they want

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:12.540 align:middle line:84%
is to lose that power
of foreclosure over you

00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:15.290 align:middle line:84%
through what is
a Jubilee system.

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:17.630 align:middle line:84%
This is what I would
call the Silver Age

00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:20.280 align:middle line:84%
of priesthood thinking, the
ones that really understood

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:23.370 align:middle line:84%
the goodness of the Golden
Age-- what was right,

00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:25.740 align:middle line:84%
how to be productive,
how money should be

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:29.440 align:middle line:84%
a tool for the
community as a whole,

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:35.580 align:middle line:84%
rather than the god-given
right of a minority to control.

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So maybe more the
mimicry of the Golden Age

00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:40.900 align:middle line:84%
rather than the elite
trying to recreate, falsely,

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:42.110 align:middle line:90%
a golden age.

00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:43.340 align:middle line:90%
That would be more accurate.

00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:45.673 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Well, yes, because
all they're simply doing

00:51:45.673 --> 00:51:49.310 align:middle line:84%
is trying to accumulate
the resources

00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:51.700 align:middle line:84%
under their own
control, exclusively

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:52.730 align:middle line:90%
under their own control.

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And they've worked out that
financial debt is simply

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:59.324 align:middle line:84%
the most ingenious mechanism
that you could use.

00:51:59.324 --> 00:52:00.865 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For control
over a species.

00:52:00.865 --> 00:52:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: But you've got
these Silver Age priesthoods

00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:06.730 align:middle line:84%
and these ideas that
have been distorted,

00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:08.625 align:middle line:84%
that if you look
back far enough--

00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:11.680 align:middle line:84%
and it's there in
every major religion--

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.440 align:middle line:90%
and that is debt forgiveness.

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:14.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: It's there.

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
no forgiveness now.

00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: There's
no forgiveness.

00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:20.320 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't-- everybody knows
that the current situation

00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:21.620 align:middle line:90%
we're in, just cancel it.

00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:22.995 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Cancel
every-- exactly.

00:52:22.995 --> 00:52:23.786 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Reset.

00:52:23.786 --> 00:52:27.440 align:middle line:84%
To use the kids'
term today, reset it,

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:30.220 align:middle line:90%
and you've got a solution.

00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:32.090 align:middle line:84%
But these people will
tell you, no, it'll

00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:33.510 align:middle line:90%
be chaos and so on like that.

00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:34.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: In the
times, it wasn't.

00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:39.400 align:middle line:84%
But to move on from
what happened in Rome,

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Tiberius kind of
saved it for them.

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was a deadly
period of time.

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:47.590 align:middle line:84%
But the chaos that
followed is directly

00:52:47.590 --> 00:52:51.310 align:middle line:84%
linked into the
absolute shocking period

00:52:51.310 --> 00:52:54.190 align:middle line:84%
of the destruction of
the temple in Jerusalem,

00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:58.040 align:middle line:84%
which had literally become
a central bank at that time.

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:01.300 align:middle line:84%
This was really
what the-- what's

00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:04.670 align:middle line:84%
behind the story of Christ
in the temple and so on.

00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
there was a genocide.

00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:11.500 align:middle line:84%
The figures were
astounding for the period

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:17.180 align:middle line:84%
of what happened in that
period between 70 AD and 140 AD

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:18.410 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:23.050 align:middle line:84%
The next worst period of time
is when the super companies

00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:25.480 align:middle line:84%
became super banks
in the Middle Ages.

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:29.220 align:middle line:84%
You've got the Bardis, Peruzzis,
and the Florentine banking

00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:30.270 align:middle line:90%
houses.

00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And they basically created
a derivative system,

00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:36.340 align:middle line:84%
very similar to
what we have today.

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:38.434 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talk about
false measures.

00:53:38.434 --> 00:53:39.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: That
blew up on them.

00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No one
can even define it.

00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:41.890 align:middle line:90%
But go ahead.

00:53:41.890 --> 00:53:43.556 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Well,
you see, that blew up

00:53:43.556 --> 00:53:48.260 align:middle line:84%
on them, which precipitated
a famine, which destroyed

00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:52.580 align:middle line:84%
the immune system of
the peoples of Europe

00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:55.910 align:middle line:84%
just in time for this
Black Death to come along.

00:53:55.910 --> 00:54:00.530 align:middle line:84%
I tell you, if people want
to know an apocalyptic time

00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:04.570 align:middle line:84%
or anything, the 1340s
is, without a doubt,

00:54:04.570 --> 00:54:07.196 align:middle line:84%
to date, the worst
period in history

00:54:07.196 --> 00:54:08.820 align:middle line:84%
that any people have
ever gone through.

00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it was
following starvation.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:10.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Yeah.

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:11.270 align:middle line:90%
And the thing is, we forget.

00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:12.920 align:middle line:84%
We think of it like
a European thing.

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.450 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese were
wiped out by it.

00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:15.595 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:15.595 --> 00:54:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: I don't
know what happened

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:18.210 align:middle line:90%
if they had it in Mesoamerica.

00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:20.251 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So where there's
a lack of productivity

00:54:20.251 --> 00:54:22.532 align:middle line:84%
or financial ruination,
you have starvation,

00:54:22.532 --> 00:54:24.240 align:middle line:84%
you have the weakening
of immune systems,

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:26.370 align:middle line:84%
and organisms can
simply flourish.

00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Yeah.

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:29.134 align:middle line:84%
And when you get
these situations,

00:54:29.134 --> 00:54:31.550 align:middle line:84%
there's a case study, I think
it's the island of Guernsey,

00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:34.880 align:middle line:84%
or it's the island of Jersey
in the English Channel.

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:37.600 align:middle line:84%
After the Napoleonic Wars, they
were in the same situation.

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:38.884 align:middle line:90%
They'd been ravaged by war.

00:54:38.884 --> 00:54:40.300 align:middle line:84%
But they had all
these strong lads

00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:42.020 align:middle line:90%
that came back from the wars.

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:44.817 align:middle line:84%
And they had all these merchants
whose shops were falling down.

00:54:44.817 --> 00:54:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And nothing was getting done
because the Bank of England

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:49.670 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't put any
money into the place.

00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:52.120 align:middle line:84%
So somebody had the
bright idea of just,

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:53.470 align:middle line:90%
we'll just create our own money.

00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:54.550 align:middle line:90%
I remember this.

00:54:54.550 --> 00:54:55.110 align:middle line:90%
It's really interesting.

00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:55.818 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Yes.

00:54:55.818 --> 00:54:57.210 align:middle line:90%
And they did this.

00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, they
had an economy going.

00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was quite a few
years later before the Bank

00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:05.675 align:middle line:84%
of England-- it got big
enough to be noticed--

00:55:05.675 --> 00:55:07.620 align:middle line:90%
and it's like you can't do that.

00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:08.544 align:middle line:90%
Why can't you do it?

00:55:08.544 --> 00:55:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and there were
some very interesting things

00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:13.566 align:middle line:84%
that came out of that, because
the size of the people,

00:55:13.566 --> 00:55:14.940 align:middle line:84%
the people started
strengthening,

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:16.700 align:middle line:84%
their bone structures
strengthened.

00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:17.533 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Health.

00:55:17.533 --> 00:55:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They started gaining
in height again and health.

00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And then it started
declining again.

00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And it really wasn't
until, I think,

00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:26.710 align:middle line:84%
very recently that the body
size of the average Brit

00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:28.380 align:middle line:84%
reached what it was
in that day, where

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:31.176 align:middle line:84%
they created their own
currency and had plenty.

00:55:31.176 --> 00:55:32.800 align:middle line:84%
This is hundreds of
years before they--

00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Because
you're not limited,

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:36.655 align:middle line:84%
and you're not under that stress
of being the guy caught short

00:55:36.655 --> 00:55:39.700 align:middle line:84%
for-- I just put it
like, if there's $10,

00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:42.210 align:middle line:84%
and you're meant
to pay back $11,

00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:45.060 align:middle line:84%
and the 11th dollar
doesn't exist,

00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:47.110 align:middle line:84%
that stress that
everybody's trying

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:51.336 align:middle line:84%
to find that 11th dollar,
it tears societies apart.

00:55:51.336 --> 00:55:52.960 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have
to talk about wars.

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:54.420 align:middle line:90%
It's what happens in families.

00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:58.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, families, friendships.

00:55:58.470 --> 00:56:01.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's move forward from the
Middle Ages, then, to today.

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is called the
"Saturn Death Cult."

00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:05.410 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty cryptic.

00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:06.900 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about why.

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:08.367 align:middle line:90%
We only have a few minutes left.

00:56:08.367 --> 00:56:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Believe it or not, we have
blown through almost an hour.

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:11.825 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Blown through.

00:56:11.825 --> 00:56:12.375 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:56:12.375 --> 00:56:13.750 align:middle line:84%
I call it "The
Saturn Death Cult"

00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:19.440 align:middle line:84%
because, quite simply, there is,
in this culture, particularly

00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:23.330 align:middle line:84%
in this finance culture-- and
what we've probably not told--

00:56:23.330 --> 00:56:25.880 align:middle line:84%
explained to everybody is that
these archetypes that come out

00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:32.930 align:middle line:84%
of the doomsday event, when
Saturn fell, the Golden Age,

00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:35.160 align:middle line:84%
they're stamped all over
our financial system,

00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:37.580 align:middle line:84%
our corporate people,
in the form of symbols.

00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:39.967 align:middle line:84%
If you go into the
website, I give examples.

00:56:39.967 --> 00:56:41.800 align:middle line:84%
The most obvious one
is the all-seeing eye--

00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:42.750 align:middle line:90%
Great imagery here.

00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: --all
that kind of stuff.

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:44.340 align:middle line:90%
We all know it.

00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:45.930 align:middle line:90%
We know where it's from.

00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:48.430 align:middle line:84%
When we understand
where it comes

00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:52.160 align:middle line:84%
from on a cosmological
basis, it frees you

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:56.250 align:middle line:84%
from thinking these guys, gee,
must be somehow in charge,

00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:59.570 align:middle line:84%
because it gives them
some kind of authority.

00:56:59.570 --> 00:57:04.910 align:middle line:84%
But why else would they
stamp that Saturn symbolism

00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:07.140 align:middle line:84%
onto things like
the US dollar bill?

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:08.410 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:13.580 align:middle line:84%
You see it in television
shows; it pops through.

00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:15.200 align:middle line:84%
The reason I call
it a death cult

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:19.700 align:middle line:84%
is because it is
precisely geared

00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:24.060 align:middle line:84%
to leaching the human species
of all its productive capacity

00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:29.860 align:middle line:84%
to the point of the species
almost coming to its end.

00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:34.660 align:middle line:84%
I also am of the opinion that
there is actually a program

00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:39.760 align:middle line:84%
to cull the human species to
a level that can be controlled

00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:43.580 align:middle line:84%
once the technology is in
place that they've aimed for,

00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:45.270 align:middle line:90%
for the elite to hold control.

00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:48.520 align:middle line:84%
A rewilding of the planet
is supposed to take place.

00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:51.740 align:middle line:90%
The population reduced down to--

00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:55.290 align:middle line:84%
We've heard much of this
in some of our interviews.

00:57:55.290 --> 00:57:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: 2
billion, 500 million.

00:57:57.490 --> 00:57:58.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 500 million, yes.

00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: These
sorts of numbers,

00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:02.680 align:middle line:84%
it's not as if they
hide this stuff in terms

00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:04.437 align:middle line:84%
of what they would
like to do and such.

00:58:04.437 --> 00:58:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that might be
what they want, but now let's

00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:09.330 align:middle line:84%
switch it to what
our agenda can be,

00:58:09.330 --> 00:58:10.750 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
have to buy this.

00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:11.416 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: No.

00:58:11.416 --> 00:58:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things in studying

00:58:14.570 --> 00:58:16.770 align:middle line:84%
these collapses of
financial models

00:58:16.770 --> 00:58:20.430 align:middle line:84%
is that, rather than going
out and fighting these guys

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:24.780 align:middle line:84%
on the front lines with
violence or whatever,

00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:29.030 align:middle line:84%
we can just simply let their
system implode if we all

00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:33.290 align:middle line:84%
gather enough knowledge
in how to present

00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:38.550 align:middle line:84%
an alternative way of going
about things to the one that

00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:40.030 align:middle line:90%
is existing at the moment.

00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:41.781 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion,
they're in a panic.

00:58:41.781 --> 00:58:43.280 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
get stuff, they're

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.040 align:middle line:84%
accelerating their
programs, they

00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:48.050 align:middle line:84%
know it's reaching that
critical mass stage.

00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:49.600 align:middle line:90%
It's starting to implode.

00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.270 align:middle line:84%
When it does, we
need people who know

00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:55.882 align:middle line:84%
how to create monetary
systems that are not debt--

00:58:55.882 --> 00:58:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Alternative
systems, yes.

00:58:57.340 --> 00:58:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: --that
are debt-free,

00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:02.120 align:middle line:90%
that work in that sense.

00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of
that, we need people

00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:11.150 align:middle line:84%
who understand the true
essence of the Golden Age,

00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:15.980 align:middle line:84%
as Silver Age priesthoods
tried to bring down to us.

00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:17.944 align:middle line:84%
That which was
written in stone is

00:59:17.944 --> 00:59:19.360 align:middle line:84%
something we should
all be looking

00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:21.360 align:middle line:90%
back to with fresh eyes.

00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:23.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So tell us what
was written in stone.

00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Well,
basically, the ability

00:59:26.310 --> 00:59:29.940 align:middle line:84%
to interact with
each other and trust

00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:33.660 align:middle line:84%
that the mechanisms
that we use in defining

00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:37.487 align:middle line:84%
our actions between each other
are viewed the same everywhere.

00:59:37.487 --> 00:59:39.070 align:middle line:84%
It comes back to
weights and measures.

00:59:39.070 --> 00:59:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there's some common
understanding, common good.

00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Yeah.

00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's going to have a
different spiritual level.

00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:48.460 align:middle line:84%
I hear people with spiritual
levels I can't even comprehend.

00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:52.770 align:middle line:84%
I have my own sort of level,
which is pretty down to earth,

00:59:52.770 --> 00:59:55.462 align:middle line:84%
materialistic, I guess,
in some people's eyes.

00:59:55.462 --> 00:59:57.170 align:middle line:84%
What I need to know,
though, is that when

00:59:57.170 --> 00:59:59.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm dealing with somebody on
a different spiritual level,

00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:05.100 align:middle line:84%
that we can trust what it is
that defines our interactions.

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:08.250 align:middle line:84%
At the moment, when you're
dealing with the elite, when

01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:11.690 align:middle line:84%
you're dealing with people
in position of power,

01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:16.230 align:middle line:84%
there is that horrible
understanding that we all have

01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:19.340 align:middle line:84%
that the playing
field's not level.

01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And in my opinion, it
all comes back down

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:26.940 align:middle line:84%
to the issuance of
debt-based money.

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:29.060 align:middle line:84%
You start with that,
you clean that up.

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.620 align:middle line:90%
The rest of it--

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there are
many iterations of it,

01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:34.830 align:middle line:84%
going into barter
and time banking.

01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And once systems-- that
old debt-based system

01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:41.490 align:middle line:84%
starts collapsing, we're
a resourceful bunch.

01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:44.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot we can do
to continue on and create

01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:45.192 align:middle line:90%
something new.

01:00:45.192 --> 01:00:46.650 align:middle line:10%
>>MCLACHLAN:
Hopefully, we'll be so

01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:51.360 align:middle line:10%
horrified by the chaos these
people cause in their collapse

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:56.080 align:middle line:10%
that we will identify that it
is actually their "one rule

01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:00.910 align:middle line:10%
for them, one rule for
us" approach to setting up

01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:05.560 align:middle line:10%
the world system, however
it is, from local, almost,

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:09.420 align:middle line:10%
if you want to,
to galactic level.

01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:13.297 align:middle line:84%
We'll be so horrified
with the inequality.

01:01:13.297 --> 01:01:15.630 align:middle line:84%
There's always going to be
inequality between somebody's

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:17.880 align:middle line:84%
going to be more productive
than somebody else and all

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:18.780 align:middle line:90%
this sort of stuff.

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Where we can't have
inequality is in the laws

01:01:21.130 --> 01:01:25.720 align:middle line:84%
that we use to govern
our relationships.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.704 align:middle line:84%
They have to be
trusted to be equal.

01:01:27.704 --> 01:01:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Has to
be a common good.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:29.545 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: Yeah.

01:01:29.545 --> 01:01:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's where we can
look back to the Golden Age.

01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:36.210 align:middle line:84%
We can look back to true, what
you might call Saturn worship,

01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:37.750 align:middle line:90%
if you want to do it that way.

01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Some people do it
through Christian thing,

01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Muslim, Buddhist, other people
have what we would call pagan.

01:01:43.350 --> 01:01:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At this
point, we're not

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.812 align:middle line:84%
aligning Saturn with
Lucifer or anything else.

01:01:45.812 --> 01:01:47.020 align:middle line:90%
This is not what's happening.

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MCLACHLAN: No, no, no.

01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:48.990 align:middle line:90%
It's just looking back--

01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A time of abundance.

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:52.103 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: --yeah, when
those religions preached

01:01:52.103 --> 01:01:55.010 align:middle line:84%
the idea of equality
in the judgments

01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:59.340 align:middle line:84%
that we use to define how
we deal with each other.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:02.465 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On that, we-- I can't
believe an hour has passed,

01:02:02.465 --> 01:02:04.590 align:middle line:84%
and it seems like we've
only scratched the surface.

01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:07.440 align:middle line:90%
But again, there's a resource.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for your time, Troy.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.655 align:middle line:84%
>>MCLACHLAN: Oh,
look, thank you.

01:02:10.655 --> 01:02:11.324 align:middle line:90%
Thanks so much.

01:02:11.324 --> 01:02:13.240 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, you can
go to Troy's website,

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:17.350 align:middle line:10%
saturndeathcult.com, and it
perfectly lays this story out,

01:02:17.350 --> 01:02:20.010 align:middle line:10%
well illustrated and
well worth the time.

01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.510 align:middle line:84%
