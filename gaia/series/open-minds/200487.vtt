>>REGINA MEREDITH:
We've all played

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.890 align:middle line:10%
with plenty of divination
tools in our journey

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.600 align:middle line:10%
to seeking life's truth.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.510 align:middle line:10%
For some, it's Tarot,
numerology, astrology.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.060 align:middle line:84%
But there is also perhaps
a lesser-known but no less

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.670 align:middle line:84%
powerful system
called human design.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.540 align:middle line:10%
Today we're speaking with
Dirk Nellens, a practitioner

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.290 align:middle line:10%
of the art that was
brought into the world

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.620 align:middle line:10%
by a man named Ra in
an eight-day download.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think his story, which I
first heard about 20 years ago,

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I thought, how did
this even happen?

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting, because
there is a video of Ra.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.000 align:middle line:84%
What is the-- what's
the whole name?

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, Ra Uru Hu.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.420 align:middle line:84%
There's a video
of him on YouTube

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.379 align:middle line:84%
that has him sitting outside,
talking about his own journey.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And he starts out
by saying-- and he's

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.085 align:middle line:84%
a very compelling figure,
like a prophet presence,

00:01:12.085 --> 00:01:12.960 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: Mm-hmm.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It draws people in
with a very certain and slow

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.950 align:middle line:84%
way he speaks, and
the notion he says,

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:84%
well, I think we
could say this started

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.870 align:middle line:90%
as a journey of madness.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:24.670 align:middle line:90%

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.530 align:middle line:10%
So let's go ahead
and introduce people

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.220 align:middle line:10%
who don't know about
human design to Ra--

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.580 align:middle line:10%
how it came into existence,
who started playing with it,

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.010 align:middle line:10%
if it was just something
that made sense to people,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.740 align:middle line:10%
or it was really hard to
get their minds around.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.260 align:middle line:10%
Because it's so complex.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.960 align:middle line:10%
>>NELLENS: One of the
interesting things in that--

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.510 align:middle line:10%
it's basically a documentary
of his experience

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.240 align:middle line:10%
of how human design
came into the world--

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:59.370 align:middle line:10%
is that he states human
design stands by itself.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't need any
explanation necessarily

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.550 align:middle line:90%
of where it came from.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.340 align:middle line:84%
But I owe it to the
source of the knowledge

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.087 align:middle line:84%
to let you know how this
story came into existence.

00:02:11.087 --> 00:02:12.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's very true.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.220 align:middle line:10%
Because it seems
to draw on a lot

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.020 align:middle line:10%
of different kind of ancient
understandings and systems.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.420 align:middle line:10%
But yet it's own system.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: Yeah, there was a
friend of mine who used to say,

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.730 align:middle line:84%
if he would have
said, like, listen,

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.810 align:middle line:84%
I was somewhere in my garage,
and I pulled a Kabbalah

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.742 align:middle line:84%
together with some genetics,
and some I'Ching, and this

00:02:34.742 --> 00:02:37.200 align:middle line:84%
and that, and here you are,
here's the human design system,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.352 align:middle line:84%
it would probably have
had much more impact.

00:02:39.352 --> 00:02:40.152 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:40.152 --> 00:02:40.952 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: But the
story is very different.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Like he said, he had
a mystical encounter

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.340 align:middle line:84%
that lasted for eight days and
was actually very unpleasant.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:90%
And disturbing.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.440 align:middle line:90%
He was trying to push it away.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.850 align:middle line:84%
We should set up-- he
was living like a hermit.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: Yeah.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:01.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.800 align:middle line:84%
In a 300-year-old cottage,
and not eating food.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.480 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this will
make people delirious,

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.720 align:middle line:10%
but it also separates us
enough from our reality

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.225 align:middle line:10%
that we can be open to these
things, which he was very open.

00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:12.025 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: Mm-hmm.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Like, OK, the experience as
such that brought human design

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.150 align:middle line:90%
into the world is astonishing.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.790 align:middle line:90%
It's very weird.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.100 align:middle line:90%
There was a lot of--

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.270 align:middle line:84%
it was actually very precise
and scientific information

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.590 align:middle line:84%
that he had to live
with for about 10 years

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.700 align:middle line:84%
without it being
acknowledged as truth.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.030 align:middle line:84%
So human design is based
on the mass of neutrinos

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.240 align:middle line:84%
or the existence of
a magnetic monopole,

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.700 align:middle line:84%
or there being stars in the
universe that are actually

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.410 align:middle line:90%
older than the universe itself.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:84%
There was all kind of weird
scientific information

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.990 align:middle line:90%
that was, like, hm, this thing--

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.340 align:middle line:90%
like, where does this come from?

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.360 align:middle line:90%
What is this?

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: 10 years later,
science starts discovering

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.820 align:middle line:90%
that neutrinos have mass.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a university
somewhere in Finland

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.590 align:middle line:84%
that is working on the existence
of a magnetic monopole.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.610 align:middle line:84%
So all these scientific
aspects of design,

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.140 align:middle line:84%
they are substantiated over
time, which obviously gave him

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.440 align:middle line:90%
a huge amount of relief.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.750 align:middle line:90%
He basically took off--

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.630 align:middle line:84%
he had a hat that was, I
think, from Northern India

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.710 align:middle line:90%
or Tibetan origin.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And he took it off the
day that they discovered

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.288 align:middle line:90%
the mass of neutrinos.

00:04:26.288 --> 00:04:28.455 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because he felt
acknowledged in the world,

00:04:28.455 --> 00:04:29.310 align:middle line:90%
or why?

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: Because he felt
acknowledged in his own process

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.190 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.820 align:middle line:84%
He was, in the end,
a very detailed and--

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.823 align:middle line:90%
yeah, a very detailed man.

00:04:40.823 --> 00:04:42.990 align:middle line:84%
He was really looking into
the depths of everything.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And he wasn't necessarily
comfortable by the fact

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.230 align:middle line:84%
that human design
would just be esoteric.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.880 align:middle line:90%
It isn't.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.493 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So he was very ordered
toward visual impressions.

00:04:57.493 --> 00:04:59.160 align:middle line:84%
So he would have been
easy to work with.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.560 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to give
a download to someone--

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.775 align:middle line:84%
well, see a human
design chart, I mean,

00:05:04.775 --> 00:05:06.150 align:middle line:84%
he would probably
be someone that

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.185 align:middle line:84%
could be worked with because
the visual capacity within him.

00:05:09.185 --> 00:05:11.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: Yeah, and the
intelligence that he says.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
intelligence, yeah.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: Yeah, for sure.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, OK, so eight
days, this stuff just

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.600 align:middle line:90%
starts pouring into him.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.760 align:middle line:90%
He was like, stop it.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.410 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.260 align:middle line:90%
It continues and continues.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.090 align:middle line:84%
When did it assemble itself into
a system that could actually

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.050 align:middle line:90%
be utilized?

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Did that happen
right away, or did--

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: No.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.460 align:middle line:84%
From what I know
and what he shared,

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.630 align:middle line:84%
was that he needed
several years--

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.210 align:middle line:84%
I think up to seven, he
said, like of basically

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.100 align:middle line:90%
recovering from the--

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.725 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The trauma
of the experience.

00:05:39.725 --> 00:05:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: Yes.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.240 align:middle line:84%
So in those years,
he was continuing

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.570 align:middle line:84%
to study stuff for himself, or
continuing to channel and write

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.370 align:middle line:90%
things down.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.610 align:middle line:84%
The whole "Rave I'Ching" was
written down in that period.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And he started to put it out
in the beginning of the '90s,

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.040 align:middle line:84%
I think '92 or '93,
somewhere over there,

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.870 align:middle line:84%
to people in Ibiza
that were pulling it

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.200 align:middle line:90%
out of him basically.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, so by the time I
found out about it,

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.740 align:middle line:90%
it was probably 2001 in Sedona.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.250 align:middle line:84%
There was a pretty
large community

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.840 align:middle line:84%
of people that had
intersected and worked closely

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.420 align:middle line:84%
with Ra at the time
that ended up in Sedona.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.600 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: Yes.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.257 align:middle line:90%
He also ended up in Sedona.

00:06:19.257 --> 00:06:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I never met him.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.173 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: No, yeah.

00:06:21.173 --> 00:06:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.730 align:middle line:90%
Sorry I didn't get to meet him.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.700 align:middle line:84%
He seemed like a really
pretty interesting character.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.870 align:middle line:90%
So I was exposed to it then.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.570 align:middle line:10%
And one thing that
struck me about it

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:37.660 align:middle line:10%
was that, first of all, I sensed
an odd kind of logic in it,

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:42.550 align:middle line:10%
but I also related to the
kind of basic typology.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.830 align:middle line:10%
You have to really
understand it to get down

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.870 align:middle line:10%
into the details,
and the pathways,

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.230 align:middle line:10%
and the gates and everything.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.880 align:middle line:10%
But as I heard my friends
read each other and such,

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.620 align:middle line:10%
I thought, well,
you know, this seems

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.540 align:middle line:10%
to be a little more
functionally useful

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.520 align:middle line:10%
than a lot of the other
sources of divination.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: The thing
is, like I come

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.820 align:middle line:84%
from a background in
social anthropology,

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.980 align:middle line:84%
and in social
anthropology, they use

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.940 align:middle line:84%
lenses to look at what
it is to be human beings.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.275 align:middle line:90%
And these lenses, they evolve.

00:07:20.275 --> 00:07:22.880 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.910 align:middle line:84%
150 years ago, the lens
that anthropology used

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.690 align:middle line:90%
was very Darwinian-influenced.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Those people from
those countries

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.833 align:middle line:84%
who don't eat with
a fork and a knife,

00:07:34.833 --> 00:07:37.720 align:middle line:84%
they're somewhere down
the evolutionary track.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: These lenses in
anthropology, they evolved.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.680 align:middle line:84%
When I left my
studies in the '90s,

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.670 align:middle line:84%
we were looking at
cognitive anthropology.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.710 align:middle line:84%
So cognitive
anthropology is saying,

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:84%
all this human diversity
that is out there,

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:59.280 align:middle line:84%
all this diversity in
social-cultural expression,

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.800 align:middle line:84%
economical expression,
religious expression,

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:08.125 align:middle line:84%
kinship-oriented expressions,
is that limited or unlimited?

00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that
limited or unlimited?

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.583 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: Yes, is there
a limitation to it,

00:08:11.583 --> 00:08:13.990 align:middle line:90%
or is there no limitation to it?

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And the answer seems
like it's both.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.780 align:middle line:84%
So what they started
looking at is, cognitively,

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:32.190 align:middle line:84%
what is it that somehow
we are all born with?

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:36.559 align:middle line:84%
And they start discovering
that it doesn't matter

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:43.260 align:middle line:84%
what kind of country, or
society, or culture a kid

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:48.620 align:middle line:84%
comes from, around the age of
2, the kid goes, this is mine.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.040 align:middle line:90%
They all do it.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And then the parent says,
listen, oh, well, it's mine,

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.320 align:middle line:84%
or it's ours, or
it's from whoever.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Those energetic mechanisms,
if they weren't in us,

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.470 align:middle line:84%
in our cognition, there would
be no economical expression

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:06.550 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:10.600 align:middle line:84%
So we are starting to
find, slowly, slowly,

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:15.120 align:middle line:84%
what you hear
nowadays quite a lot--

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.550 align:middle line:84%
actually, by a lot of people
who come and see you--

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:22.810 align:middle line:84%
is humans, we are
hardwired in a certain way.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Like Brené Brown, for example,
says we're hardwired to belong.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.440 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, you don't
really understand--

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.380 align:middle line:84%
most people don't really
understand how that hardwiring

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:90%
to belong operates.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Most of us, we think it's a
matter of trying to fit in,

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.410 align:middle line:84%
and all the consequences
that come out of that,

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.200 align:middle line:90%
a lot of suffering.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at human design,

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:49.780 align:middle line:84%
the weird thing about
it from the perspective

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.540 align:middle line:84%
of an anthropologist is
that you all of a sudden

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:58.570 align:middle line:84%
have the full layout
of how we human beings

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:05.930 align:middle line:84%
are energetically hardwired and
how that hard wiring operates.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.210 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: What its
detriments and its potentials

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.790 align:middle line:10%
are embedded in it.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:15.490 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: Well-- yes.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And no.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:17.380 align:middle line:10%
[CHUCKLES]

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.030 align:middle line:10%
>>NELLENS: It depends, in a
way, of how we go about it.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Like, one of the things that
is clear from what Ra mentioned

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:31.320 align:middle line:84%
is that, in contrast to so many
other revelations that humanity

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.280 align:middle line:84%
received, human design
is an information

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.420 align:middle line:84%
that God revealed from what
he called the design crystal

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.210 align:middle line:84%
bundle that resides
in the Earth.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So human design
information is basically

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth talking to us
and saying, like, listen guys,

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.400 align:middle line:84%
the way that I
work inside of you,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.490 align:middle line:84%
the way that you are
wired in my intelligence,

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:02.210 align:middle line:84%
it looks like this,
and it works like this.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And obviously he
wasn't as experience

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.490 align:middle line:90%
with his dog called Barley.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
presence of his dog

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.980 align:middle line:84%
that made him wonder, OK,
what the hell is going on

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.540 align:middle line:90%
with my dog?

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And this intelligence
started revealing to him

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.890 align:middle line:84%
how other life forms
are energetically

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:26.490 align:middle line:84%
wired within the intelligence
of Mother Nature.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So you'll get all kinds
of energetic matrices

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:36.300 align:middle line:84%
depending on the genetic form
that we are dealing with.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.070 align:middle line:84%
When we're looking
at a human design,

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.480 align:middle line:90%
we're looking at a body graph.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.220 align:middle line:84%
It has nine centers, 36
channels, and all this stuff.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.720 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking at a mammal,
it's different than insect,

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.127 align:middle line:84%
it's different than fowl,
fish, all these things.

00:11:47.127 --> 00:11:48.960 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Were all of
those were different--

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.150 align:middle line:10%
>>NELLENS: All of those
matrices were revealed.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:53.190 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:57.660 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: And what is
basically going on with the way

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:03.050 align:middle line:84%
that we go about it
is, like, nowadays I

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:09.560 align:middle line:84%
think one of the things
that is so actual today is

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.790 align:middle line:90%
living ecologically.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.100 align:middle line:84%
But from a human
design perspective,

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:20.080 align:middle line:84%
living ecologically is
basically like surrendering

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:24.940 align:middle line:84%
to the intelligence of
Mother Nature inside of you.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:30.388 align:middle line:84%
And as you say, there
is a detrimental way

00:12:30.388 --> 00:12:32.680 align:middle line:84%
of going about it and a
positive way of going about it.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually
what it is about.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.580 align:middle line:90%
It's looking at a chart.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And a chart gives you a
map, and shows you, OK, here

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:47.080 align:middle line:84%
is the intelligence
of life inside of you.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:52.280 align:middle line:10%
We know that, for hundreds
of thousands of years,

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.620 align:middle line:10%
there is a strength conditioning
of approaching life mentally,

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.360 align:middle line:10%
and that approaching
life mentally

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:03.940 align:middle line:10%
is rather harsh, with
all the consequences

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:04.960 align:middle line:10%
that come out of it.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.360 align:middle line:84%
There's so much--
survival-oriented approach

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.640 align:middle line:84%
of life brings about all
kinds of chemistry that

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.540 align:middle line:84%
ain't necessarily
loving to who we are.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at a
chart, you're looking at, OK,

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.280 align:middle line:84%
what is this
intelligence for me?

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.640 align:middle line:84%
What is Mother Nature's
intelligence in me

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:27.340 align:middle line:84%
that I can basically
surrender to and let my mind

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.700 align:middle line:90%
observe what it is to be alive.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:37.990 align:middle line:10%
So human design is a tool
that is primarily there

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:45.330 align:middle line:10%
to nurture the intelligence
of a person's life spark

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.820 align:middle line:10%
and the possibility
for that person,

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.090 align:middle line:10%
whether it's, you,
me, or anybody else,

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:54.300 align:middle line:10%
to develop a witnessing
consciousness,

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:59.050 align:middle line:10%
to basically be in awe of
what it is to be alive.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:02.610 align:middle line:84%
When I started seeing this from
an anthropological perspective,

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:06.420 align:middle line:84%
that, listen, we're all sharing
the same hardwiring, all of us.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.120 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter whether you
come from a jungle somewhere,

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.750 align:middle line:84%
or from China, or
from Belgium like me.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.550 align:middle line:84%
We're all sharing
the same hardwiring.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.370 align:middle line:84%
We're just going about
it in different ways--

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.560 align:middle line:84%
individually,
socially, culturally.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.920 align:middle line:84%
We're just giving different
expressions to this hardwiring.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Why is there so much judgment
on ourselves or on others

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.110 align:middle line:90%
about how they go about life?

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.840 align:middle line:84%
There is no good way or
bad way of going about it.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:84%
There's just giving
an expression

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.140 align:middle line:84%
to a universal
energetic hardwiring.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:45.000 align:middle line:10%
OK, so that would immediately
bring up the notion

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.800 align:middle line:10%
that those cultures
that tended to skew more

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:53.250 align:middle line:10%
and more toward mind moved
further away from the Earth

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:54.900 align:middle line:10%
matrix relationship.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.420 align:middle line:10%
Those cultures who are
indigenous, for example,

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.265 align:middle line:10%
may not have strayed as far.

00:15:00.265 --> 00:15:02.640 align:middle line:10%
And yet there's their own
belief, their own conditioning,

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.050 align:middle line:10%
their own historical
perspective and experience

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:07.080 align:middle line:10%
that may not have
wandered as far

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:12.470 align:middle line:10%
from their basic
interdependence with the Earth

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:15.000 align:middle line:10%
and understanding we're
from the same impulse.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.380 align:middle line:10%
So maybe they retained more of
that natural kind of behavior

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.315 align:middle line:10%
as a result. As
an anthropologist,

00:15:21.315 --> 00:15:22.410 align:middle line:10%
do you notice that?

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: Yes, I think
there is a truth in there.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:30.060 align:middle line:84%
But there is also something
to observe in a way.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And that is that there
is tribal energy.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Like when you are
living in a tribe,

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.378 align:middle line:84%
you are living in a certain
confined energetic structure.

00:15:40.378 --> 00:15:42.670 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, with
all the beliefs and history.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:47.150 align:middle line:10%
>>NELLENS: The moment you start
moving into the collective,

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.250 align:middle line:10%
there is an expansion
of consciousness

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:50.510 align:middle line:10%
that is taking place.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:53.300 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time
there is a potential loss

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:59.300 align:middle line:84%
also of cohesion and
a certain something

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:03.690 align:middle line:84%
that holds in place when
the structure is smaller.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And in the hardwiring
of design of a chart,

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.690 align:middle line:84%
you can see, OK, we're
hardwired tribally.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.570 align:middle line:84%
So we're hardwired to
belong, as Brené Brown says.

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And it has a certain
operating system.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.690 align:middle line:90%
And we're hardwired to share.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:21.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's collective.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:26.440 align:middle line:84%
We're sharing a certain
abstract frequency.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.120 align:middle line:10%
Like we all have a
certain history in common.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.362 align:middle line:84%
We all have certain
desires in common.

00:16:33.362 --> 00:16:35.570 align:middle line:84%
We all want to ride a bicycle
in some way or another.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole
collectivity that is

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:42.770 align:middle line:90%
built on sharing abstract life.

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a whole
aspect to sharing logic.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're making
an appointment

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.060 align:middle line:84%
to be here at a certain
time, the bus comes on time,

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.950 align:middle line:90%
and all this kind of stuff.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And then we're also hardwired
to empower ourselves.

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:03.420 align:middle line:84%
So there is all kinds
of hardwiring within us

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:10.000 align:middle line:84%
that when you are talking about
just from a tribal perspective,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.410 align:middle line:84%
for example, those who
are really individual,

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:19.910 align:middle line:84%
they don't necessarily
thrive so well

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.790 align:middle line:90%
within all kinds of tribes.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.440 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
tribes that are more

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:27.640 align:middle line:84%
acknowledging an individual,
and there's other tribes that--

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.880 align:middle line:84%
here, we all get the
tools, and that's it then.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.820 align:middle line:90%
OK, well.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.870 align:middle line:10%
So I see what you're saying,
the yes and no of that.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:39.342 align:middle line:10%
So when you were first
exposed to it, what made sense

00:17:39.342 --> 00:17:41.050 align:middle line:10%
to you immediately,
what struck as truth,

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:43.175 align:middle line:10%
and what drew you in, to
the point where you really

00:17:43.175 --> 00:17:46.030 align:middle line:10%
decided to devote yourself
to the understanding

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.910 align:middle line:10%
and practicing of it?

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:49.650 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: Yeah,
what struck as truth

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:57.930 align:middle line:84%
for me was it was clear that
anthropology, cognitively,

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.260 align:middle line:84%
is looking, and
searching, and building

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:06.060 align:middle line:84%
this universal
energetic hardwiring.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.040 align:middle line:90%
We are hardwired.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:08.940 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:10.230 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And so is
this the first system

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.563 align:middle line:10%
that look like it actually
tapped into the understanding

00:18:12.563 --> 00:18:13.425 align:middle line:10%
of that hardwiring?

00:18:13.425 --> 00:18:14.550 align:middle line:10%
>>NELLENS: Not necessarily.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.080 align:middle line:10%
It was the first
system that gave you

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.165 align:middle line:10%
the full-blown hardwiring.

00:18:17.165 --> 00:18:18.420 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The full-blown-- OK.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: Like anthropology
was already discovering that

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.940 align:middle line:84%
we're all sensitive to gravity,
that we're all sensitive

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.300 align:middle line:84%
to possessiveness, that
there's all kinds of--

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:31.270 align:middle line:84%
but when you're looking
at a human design chart,

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:35.320 align:middle line:84%
you are basically seeing,
in all of those channels,

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:39.850 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing all the
different life forces

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:45.220 align:middle line:84%
that we need in order to
have a human experience.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.800 align:middle line:90%
That's what you see.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:51.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if some alien would drop
down in front of me and ask me,

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:56.110 align:middle line:84%
like, Dirk, what is it to
be in your genetic material,

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:58.648 align:middle line:84%
I could just sum up those
36 different channels.

00:18:58.648 --> 00:19:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Just saying, like, this
thing is sensitive.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.180 align:middle line:90%
It emotes.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:01.980 align:middle line:90%
It procreates.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:02.860 align:middle line:90%
It builds community.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.610 align:middle line:90%
It transforms.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:05.720 align:middle line:90%
It judges.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.015 align:middle line:84%
Its thinks logically,
abstractly, all kinds of stuff.

00:19:09.015 --> 00:19:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's all in
those channels.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:13.700 align:middle line:90%
It's very basic in a way.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And then you get to see,
OK, how are you hardwired?

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:22.850 align:middle line:10%
Like how are you anchored
within this hardwiring,

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:25.400 align:middle line:10%
and how am I anchored
with it, and anybody

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.160 align:middle line:10%
else for that matter,
so that we can basically

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:33.890 align:middle line:10%
see what kind of life forces
we are emanating in life

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:39.080 align:middle line:10%
and what kind of life
forces we are receptive to.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.000 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Because in
a given incarnation,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.010 align:middle line:10%
you may come to specifically
express, or follow, and develop

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.560 align:middle line:10%
certain attributes of
yourself and your character

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.720 align:middle line:10%
and being as opposed
to another time.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.460 align:middle line:10%
So there is a time and kind
of a rhyme and reason to it

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.898 align:middle line:10%
as well, on a soul level.

00:19:56.898 --> 00:19:58.940 align:middle line:10%
You're not necessarily
here to express all things

00:19:58.940 --> 00:19:59.990 align:middle line:10%
at all times.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.810 align:middle line:10%
And it's interesting, when
you look at these charts,

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:06.950 align:middle line:10%
you're the one that's
the most unique of the--

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:09.607 align:middle line:10%
most rare of the
charts, which we're

00:20:09.607 --> 00:20:11.690 align:middle line:10%
going to get into now
because I want people to see

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:13.042 align:middle line:10%
what it is we're talking about.

00:20:13.042 --> 00:20:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And first I think we
should break it down

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:19.100 align:middle line:84%
into kind of the big,
bit-size pieces, the chunks,

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.730 align:middle line:84%
such as the most
common chart, which

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.450 align:middle line:90%
would be the generator, right?

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: Mm-hmm.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just by
numbers, percentage.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.850 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about
the generator,

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:32.210 align:middle line:10%
manifesting generator, projector
manifestor, and reflector,

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.610 align:middle line:10%
which you are, which is
like, what, less than 1%

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:35.960 align:middle line:10%
of the population or so?

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: Yeah, maybe a
little bit over a percentage.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:39.342 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, a little
bit of percentage.

00:20:39.342 --> 00:20:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And look at what your chart
looks like versus someone

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.400 align:middle line:90%
else's.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.193 align:middle line:10%
And then you talked
to my producer.

00:20:44.193 --> 00:20:45.110 align:middle line:10%
She gave you the data.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.272 align:middle line:10%
You read my chart--

00:20:46.272 --> 00:20:47.480 align:middle line:10%
a couple of them, apparently.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.938 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to
see what that is.

00:20:48.938 --> 00:20:51.650 align:middle line:84%
But also we're going to run a
couple other famous people--

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Amy Winehouse, and we'll see
if we have time for others--

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:59.540 align:middle line:84%
and see what uniquely expresses,
what the power is of expression

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.260 align:middle line:90%
through each of these people.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.660 align:middle line:90%
So you can explain a little bit.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.203 align:middle line:84%
Because really you have
to read a book or two,

00:21:05.203 --> 00:21:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and you have to
go to someone that

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:09.770 align:middle line:84%
knows what they're doing to
understand what all this means.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.120 align:middle line:90%
It's quite detailed.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.820 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with the big
pieces, generators, which

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.640 align:middle line:90%
is what percentage of society?

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: There is about 70%
of generators on this planet.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.990 align:middle line:84%
It's important to me,
though, to make clear

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:28.137 align:middle line:84%
that human design is really not
about putting anybody in a box.

00:21:28.137 --> 00:21:29.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I understand that.

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.015 align:middle line:90%
It's actually quite expansive.

00:21:31.015 --> 00:21:32.640 align:middle line:84%
But we'll start by
putting it in a box.

all have different samples,

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.700 align:middle line:84%

>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:51.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: So generators--
the life force of a generator

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:56.670 align:middle line:84%

They have a defined
sacral center.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:07.540 align:middle line:84%
70% of humanity has
energy emanating

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:12.530 align:middle line:84%
from the physical space
between their navel

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:14.050 align:middle line:90%
and their sexual organs.

There's the hara.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.000 align:middle line:10%
And they are emanating
energy from there.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.890 align:middle line:84%
So they're basically built
to find satisfaction in life.

here to be satisfied,

really important word earlier.

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Because I watched a friend of
mine who studied human design.

to respond versus having
his head tell him what to do

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.390 align:middle line:84%
An invitation basically
means that you

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:32.410 align:middle line:84%
have an inherent intelligence
inside of your life spark

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:35.680 align:middle line:84%
that recognizes whether
the energy of the other

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.027 align:middle line:84%
is available to what you
have to share or not.

00:30:38.027 --> 00:30:39.860 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And if we're
not paying attention,

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:42.310 align:middle line:10%
you're just boring everyone
and having them flee.

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:44.194 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGH]

00:30:44.194 --> 00:30:45.610 align:middle line:90%


00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.980 align:middle line:90%
So now we go to manifestors.

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: Yeah, manifestors
are about 8% to 9%

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:54.180 align:middle line:90%
of the population.

00:30:54.180 --> 00:31:00.765 align:middle line:84%
And manifestors, they are
a part of the doing family.

00:31:00.765 --> 00:31:07.110 align:middle line:84%
They're energetically inclined
to do and be impactful.

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're going
to get things done.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:09.350 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: Well--

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're interesting.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:11.050 align:middle line:10%
>>NELLENS: --generators
are going to get--

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:12.660 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: --things done too.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.498 align:middle line:10%
>>NELLENS: The thing
is, manifestors--

00:31:15.498 --> 00:31:17.290 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Why do the
manifestors in my life

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:21.310 align:middle line:10%
seem so much more focused
and strong in their will

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:22.900 align:middle line:10%
to get things done?

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: Because their energy
field is, in some way or other,

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.480 align:middle line:90%
pushing yours aside.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Well maybe that's why you
feel the presence of it.

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: So they're
designed to have an impact.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:40.340 align:middle line:90%
Ra was a manifestor.

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:43.760 align:middle line:84%
So you have this
person there that

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:47.030 align:middle line:84%
is basically informing
about something

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:50.240 align:middle line:90%
that needs to be put out.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And they have something
in their life force

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.800 align:middle line:84%
that knows how to
push through that.

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And it says, like, please,
I have something to do here.

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:04.430 align:middle line:84%
I have something
to put out here.

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:06.550 align:middle line:90%
So move away.

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:08.880 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the manifestors
I know get things done.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.750 align:middle line:10%
They have a plan, and
they execute it well.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:13.190 align:middle line:10%
And I'm always amazed.

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:14.240 align:middle line:90%
It's like, she'll do it.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.320 align:middle line:84%
She says she's going
to do it, she'll do it.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: There is
an energetic motor

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:21.560 align:middle line:84%
that is directly
connected to the throat.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.440 align:middle line:84%
So there is this necessity
to bring something out.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.420 align:middle line:90%
And it's impactful.

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
very strange to see

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:32.940 align:middle line:90%
how far that impact can range.

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:33.820 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.387 align:middle line:10%
We're going to look
at some other charts

00:32:36.387 --> 00:32:38.140 align:middle line:10%
and see what's right here too.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: In design,
for example, we were--

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.930 align:middle line:84%
in the Ibiza meetings,
when Ra was still alive,

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:45.390 align:middle line:90%
there was about 100 people.

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And that was a very,
very successful event.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.770 align:middle line:84%
If I start googling
now and seeing

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:52.340 align:middle line:84%
who is interested
in design, there's

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.990 align:middle line:90%
thousands and thousands.

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:55.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.900 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: So that's the
impact of a manifestor.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.580 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But we have to
remember, it's not astrology,

00:32:58.580 --> 00:32:59.750 align:middle line:10%
numerology, et cetera.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:01.250 align:middle line:10%
It's not tarot.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:02.090 align:middle line:10%
It's new.

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:05.540 align:middle line:90%
It's still being introduced.

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.310 align:middle line:84%
Any other thoughts on
manifestos before we

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:12.182 align:middle line:84%
go to that the most
rare and unusual--

00:33:12.182 --> 00:33:13.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
how you function,

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.320 align:middle line:84%
actually-- one
called the reflector.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.588 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: I don't think so.

00:33:16.588 --> 00:33:19.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so let's go to
the reflector, which is about 1%

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.880 align:middle line:90%
of the population.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: So reflectors,
they have no defined center.

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:28.200 align:middle line:84%
There's no consistent life
force in the reflector.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.520 align:middle line:90%
So it's always changing.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:36.600 align:middle line:84%
So reflectors are specifically
designed, actually,

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.340 align:middle line:90%
to experience experience.

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.650 align:middle line:84%
So they're basically here to
go through an experience--

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:43.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: To experiment.

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: To sample
the experience

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.880 align:middle line:84%
and then reflect on it, and
get something out of it,

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.340 align:middle line:84%
bounce something
back in that sense.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was rather astonished
in a way that when I saw

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:57.640 align:middle line:84%
my chart, I was like,
that's why I'm--

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.260 align:middle line:84%
that's why I studied
anthropology.

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, being an
anthropologist, in a way,

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:05.950 align:middle line:84%
is a perfect expression
of being a reflector.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:08.989 align:middle line:84%
You go for the experience,
you live with a tribe,

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:11.800 align:middle line:84%
you sample all kinds of
stuff, and you reflect on it.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And you give something
back in that sense.

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:17.800 align:middle line:84%
So reflectors have
a sampling aura.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Basically every single person
that they hang out with

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:25.830 align:middle line:84%
is an experiential
feel for them.

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:28.960 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's an experience
to hang out with you.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.900 align:middle line:84%
To go through-- to see
what this energy is.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:33.372 align:middle line:84%
Well, and we're
going to look at that

00:34:33.372 --> 00:34:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and see what that looks like in
a chart and how it plays out.

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:38.909 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you this--
this is so ABC kindergarten,

00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:40.110 align:middle line:90%
but let's just do it.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:42.963 align:middle line:84%
You would call a generator
if you need what?

00:34:42.963 --> 00:34:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Why would you call
on a generator.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: I would call on a
generator to build something.

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.247 align:middle line:90%
Get in, do it, create it.

00:34:50.247 --> 00:34:51.080 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: Build it.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:51.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Build it.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.969 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: Building is like, day
in, day out, day in, day out,

00:34:54.969 --> 00:34:58.020 align:middle line:84%
there is energy to do
something, to build something.

00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Similar with a
manifesting generator.

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.120 align:middle line:90%
Then we go to projectors.

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:05.560 align:middle line:84%
What would you call
on a projector for?

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: It depends
on a projector.

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:10.620 align:middle line:84%
I would call on you, for
example, for efficiency,

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and for helping to go through
an experience in a connected way

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:18.610 align:middle line:84%
so that it can bring
about progress.

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:19.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:22.510 align:middle line:90%
And what about your manifestor?

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.430 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: I wouldn't
call upon a manifestor.

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:27.460 align:middle line:84%
I would be impacted
by something that

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.000 align:middle line:90%
comes out of the manifestor.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.417 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so you'd wait
to see what they come up with,

00:35:31.417 --> 00:35:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and how it impacts you
or could impact you.

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:35.078 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: If I'm an
artist, for example,

00:35:35.078 --> 00:35:37.960 align:middle line:84%
and I walk into
Frida Kahlo's studio,

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, what the hell is this?

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:41.915 align:middle line:90%
Like, wow.

00:35:41.915 --> 00:35:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and now
what about a reflector?

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:46.890 align:middle line:84%
What would you call
it a reflector for?

00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: A reflector can tell
you something about the group

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.830 align:middle line:90%
dynamic that's going on.

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And when it's on a
one-on-one relation,

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.390 align:middle line:84%
the reflector is
good at sensing--

00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:01.870 align:middle line:90%


00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:04.820 align:middle line:90%
fine-tuning a person's energy.

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:06.310 align:middle line:90%
There's something about it.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:08.143 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because they're
connected into it.

00:36:08.143 --> 00:36:09.550 align:middle line:90%
They're experiencing it.

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:12.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: All the other types,
at some level or another,

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:16.520 align:middle line:84%
they're all caught up with
their minds in their openness.

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:19.180 align:middle line:84%
But a reflector's
design is all open.

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:28.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's easy for us to sense
the difference of a person.

00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:31.197 align:middle line:84%
I'm always immediately
attracted to, wow,

00:36:31.197 --> 00:36:32.530 align:middle line:90%
this is really unique about you.

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:33.710 align:middle line:90%
This is incredible about you.

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:34.600 align:middle line:90%
But you don't see it.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.048 align:middle line:90%
You're caught up in your mind.

00:36:36.048 --> 00:36:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
wonderful trait to have.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Because people need to have
their genius in their beauty

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:42.340 align:middle line:84%
reflected back to
them, especially

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:45.687 align:middle line:84%

so in their heads and confused.

Well, do you feel
comfortable that we can

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.040 align:middle line:90%
go ahead and dive into a chart?

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:57.100 align:middle line:10%
And let's see-- let's go
back one chart to your chart,

00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:00.550 align:middle line:10%
to see what a reflector
chart looks like.

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Meaning none of these
power centers of their being

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.430 align:middle line:84%
and their nature, their
Earth-connected matrix,

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:11.480 align:middle line:90%
is defined.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And so these centers are
either defined or undefined.

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:16.962 align:middle line:84%
And yours are all
open and undefined

00:37:16.962 --> 00:37:18.170 align:middle line:90%
as you were just speaking of.

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:19.670 align:middle line:90%
So that's what it looks like.

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:23.100 align:middle line:90%
Now let's go to my chart.

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And now we see how
mine is defined.

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can use this as
an example of the defined areas

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:30.740 align:middle line:84%
of kind of what they mean
so people start getting

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:32.840 align:middle line:90%
a feeling for the centers now.

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: So you
have a defined root.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.450 align:middle line:90%
The anchoring in life is there.

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:43.700 align:middle line:84%
There is a stability
and a grounding

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.890 align:middle line:90%
in some ways in your structure.

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And that grounding
in that structure

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:49.580 align:middle line:84%
is connected to the
emotional center.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:52.550 align:middle line:90%
So you have emotional--

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:55.162 align:middle line:84%
like you're here to rely on
your emotional intelligence.

00:37:55.162 --> 00:37:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very much so.

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.828 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: And our
emotional intelligence

00:37:57.828 --> 00:38:01.370 align:middle line:84%
is all about our
connectivity with the other.

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:04.150 align:middle line:90%
You know, we feel connected.

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And you have that
strength inside of you

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:13.110 align:middle line:84%
to recognize when
something can kick off

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:16.140 align:middle line:90%
with a feeling that connects.

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:19.710 align:middle line:84%
So in order to do that,
in order to have sense

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:23.190 align:middle line:84%
whether this is the
right energy there,

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:27.330 align:middle line:84%
there is this root energy
necessary to basically

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:29.970 align:middle line:90%
not fly off.

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:32.250 align:middle line:84%
There's hey, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:33.530 align:middle line:90%
I ain't feeling it yet.

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Wait a second--

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what my
husband says all the time.

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:36.180 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: Just a second.

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.763 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
to feel everything.

00:38:37.763 --> 00:38:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: You know, wait, wait.

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Like, we're not really
connected yet here in order

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:46.830 align:middle line:84%
to get into a shared
experience together.

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:48.120 align:middle line:90%
Let's first talk about it.

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:48.920 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Let's imagine it, how you
feel it, how you see it.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:55.200 align:middle line:84%
So that's your feeling
things through.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:39:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And it comes to a point that
your life's intelligence inside

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:04.920 align:middle line:84%
you says, now I start to feel
it, it cannot be otherwise.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
exactly right on.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:08.190 align:middle line:84%
I have to feel my
way there until it's

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:10.570 align:middle line:84%
a green light on
feeling, it's complete.

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:11.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't go.

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I go, and
there's no question.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to question it.

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:16.530 align:middle line:84%
I assume it's coming
from a higher part.

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:17.870 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that is very true.

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:18.670 align:middle line:90%
What else is--

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: Well, then
you have a defined ajna

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.850 align:middle line:84%
center, which is
mental consciousness,

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:26.890 align:middle line:90%
and a throat center.

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
green one is the ajna.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:29.373 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: The ajna.

00:39:29.373 --> 00:39:30.460 align:middle line:90%
It's mental consciousness.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.280 align:middle line:90%
It's where we conceptualize.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:35.170 align:middle line:84%
It's also the center,
in some way or another,

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:36.270 align:middle line:90%
that gives us a mind.

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:37.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: So when we are
looking at your design,

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:45.000 align:middle line:84%
for example, like
the ajna is defined,

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.950 align:middle line:84%
you're specifically defined
through a life force that

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:49.060 align:middle line:90%
is all about insights.

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:51.660 align:middle line:90%


00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:55.410 align:middle line:84%
If those insights
start ruling your life,

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:59.870 align:middle line:84%
if your mind rules
your life, there's

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:02.900 align:middle line:84%
something in there
that says, like, ooh,

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.750 align:middle line:84%
not nice for your
life force to be

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:08.730 align:middle line:90%
under a dogmatic perspective.

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:13.640 align:middle line:84%
So for your health and for your
well-being, there is no bad,

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.520 align:middle line:84%
there's no good, there is
no right, there is no wrong.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.920 align:middle line:84%
It all depends on the
individual situation.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.220 align:middle line:84%
So a non dogmatic
stance in life is

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:25.940 align:middle line:90%
something that liberates you.

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:28.430 align:middle line:84%
In terms of
conceptualizing, you were

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:32.990 align:middle line:84%
a person that emanates her
own perspective on things.

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:34.700 align:middle line:90%
You have your own insights.

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.830 align:middle line:84%
On whoever it is that
sits in front of you,

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:39.140 align:middle line:84%
you have your own
insights on it.

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And as a projector, you're
going to use that life force

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.230 align:middle line:90%
to the benefit of the other.

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Like, please, share
your insights.

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And the wacko-er
they are, the more

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:51.950 align:middle line:90%
it might be interesting to me.

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wackier?

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:53.810 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's true.

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:55.070 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing too far out.

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:57.763 align:middle line:84%
People say to me, you know,
this might sound a little-- no.

00:40:57.763 --> 00:40:58.563 align:middle line:90%
No, it won't.

00:40:58.563 --> 00:40:59.490 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:00.490 align:middle line:90%
You can't get too weird.

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:01.290 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: That's a
good sign for you.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:06.270 align:middle line:84%
It means that, inside,
there's freedom in there.

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: Everything's
-- yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no,
that's very true.

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.510 align:middle line:90%
And so we also have--

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:13.370 align:middle line:90%
and the rest are undefined.

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:15.020 align:middle line:90%
And so let's talk about--

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:18.260 align:middle line:84%
that's the throat center,
underneath the green, the ajna.

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.860 align:middle line:84%
What's the one directly
underneath that?

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: The G center.

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
is the G center,

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.290 align:middle line:90%
and what does that represent?

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Because we're going to see these
illuminated in other people,

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.600 align:middle line:90%
or defined.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: In the energetic
architecture of a human being,

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:40.100 align:middle line:84%
the G center represents our
capacity to have a self,

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.610 align:middle line:90%
to have an identity.

00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:43.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:49.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: Now, these identities
are constantly changing.

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:51.288 align:middle line:84%
We don't know each
other that well.

00:41:51.288 --> 00:41:53.580 align:middle line:84%
I know you a little bit from
the internet or something.

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:55.980 align:middle line:84%
To me, you are Regina
that I'm doing an--

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:59.020 align:middle line:84%
but you don't have the same
identity for your husband.

00:41:59.020 --> 00:41:59.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.445 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: Neither did you have
the same identity for your mom,

00:42:02.445 --> 00:42:03.960 align:middle line:84%
or for your dad,
or for a colleague.

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.510 align:middle line:84%
These identities are
constantly changing.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you're open in
particular, or for everyone?

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: Well, for everyone
they're always changing.

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:12.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: OK, but there
are specific aspects

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:16.330 align:middle line:90%
to have an identity.

00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:17.790 align:middle line:84%
There's people who are
always looking forward.

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:19.498 align:middle line:84%
There's people who
are looking backwards.

00:42:19.498 --> 00:42:21.870 align:middle line:84%
There's people who are
designed to really bring

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:23.920 align:middle line:84%
about the identity
to be in the body.

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.910 align:middle line:84%
There's all different
kinds of frequencies there.

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the core of who
we are as a human being,

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.270 align:middle line:90%
we are love in movement.

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:37.640 align:middle line:84%
That's basically at the core
of the cosmology of design

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:40.210 align:middle line:90%
and of the G center.

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:44.055 align:middle line:90%
It's where you find the big--

00:42:44.055 --> 00:42:45.930 align:middle line:84%
the cross of the vessel
of love and the cross

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:47.670 align:middle line:84%
of the Sphinx, those
two incarnation

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:52.070 align:middle line:84%
crosses that are represented
on Earth through the Sphinx

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:55.770 align:middle line:90%
and basically the cup of love.

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Those two aspects
are the core of what

00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:00.840 align:middle line:90%
it is to be a human being.

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
it defined, you

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:09.260 align:middle line:84%
have a specific frequency in
your way of being in life.

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.760 align:middle line:84%
I had a very good
friend, for example,

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:19.770 align:middle line:84%
and she's always looking to
give a creative and an inspiring

00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:22.517 align:middle line:90%
expression to her identity.

00:43:22.517 --> 00:43:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And that's consistent.

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: And
that's consistent.

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:28.230 align:middle line:84%
Whereas someone who
doesn't have it filled in,

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:30.180 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't have it
defined, it changes--

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: When you hang
out with that person,

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:35.290 align:middle line:84%
that creative aspect
comes out of you, too.

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Because they're putting
their design in you.

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.580 align:middle line:84%
So when you're open,
you're open to the others.

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: Yeah.

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so that
explains that field,

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:48.490 align:middle line:84%
the G center defined and
undefined, to an extent.

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:51.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, now looking just
off to the right of it,

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:55.230 align:middle line:84%
from our perspective, you
see another undefined center.

00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is that
in all of this?

00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: That's
the heart center.

00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.950 align:middle line:90%
or.

00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:03.780 align:middle line:84%
They call it the ego, but
from the Latin perspective, I.

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:13.095 align:middle line:84%
That's energy in us to say,
I'm Dirk, and you're Regina,

00:44:13.095 --> 00:44:15.510 align:middle line:84%
and this is mine,
and that's yours.

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:19.890 align:middle line:84%
So when you meet a kid at 2
years old that grabs your phone

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:25.290 align:middle line:84%
and says, this is mine, try
to pull it out of his hands.

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:29.070 align:middle line:84%
You're going to encounter
a contraction of muscles

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:31.370 align:middle line:90%
that is saying, that's mine.

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:32.890 align:middle line:90%
That's my will.

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:38.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is a center that
has to do with willpower.

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And there's 35% of humanity
that has defined willpower.

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:49.990 align:middle line:84%
So they have an intelligence
in their heart center

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:55.210 align:middle line:84%
that is there to stand up for
the community, for the other,

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:59.500 align:middle line:84%
for all of us, or
for themselves.

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And 65% of humanity
goes, with their mind,

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.780 align:middle line:90%
to an open heart center.

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:11.020 align:middle line:84%
So 65% of humanity is,
at some level or another,

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:12.520 align:middle line:84%
we're actually
designed to become

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:17.040 align:middle line:84%
wise of what it is to affirm
ourselves and just to be.

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:21.210 align:middle line:84%
But when our mind goes
there, 65% of humanity

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:22.568 align:middle line:90%
is caught up in trying to prove.

00:45:22.568 --> 00:45:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so we're
trying to prove ourselves,

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:26.150 align:middle line:90%
and then with that open one.

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:28.270 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we'll go
through these quickly,

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:30.310 align:middle line:84%
because oh my God, we've
been chatting so long,

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:32.660 align:middle line:84%
and I want to get to a
couple really famous charts.

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:35.170 align:middle line:84%
But I want us to know what
these centers are first.

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:36.830 align:middle line:90%
OK, now down to the right--

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:39.520 align:middle line:84%
this one's filled in,
the triangle in brown.

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.390 align:middle line:90%
What's that center?

00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:41.500 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: That's the
emotional consciousness.

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.125 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and we
talked about that.

00:45:43.125 --> 00:45:47.385 align:middle line:84%
Now we talked about
the base, root center.

00:45:47.385 --> 00:45:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Now what's right up from
the root center, in white?

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:50.885 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: Above
the root center,

00:45:50.885 --> 00:45:55.390 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find the
sacral that 70% of humanity--

00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:56.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Generators,
all of that.

00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:00.170 align:middle line:90%
OK, and then over to the left.

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: That's the spleen--

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:02.620 align:middle line:90%
splenic center.

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what's
that represent?

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:05.097 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: The splenic
center represents

00:46:05.097 --> 00:46:06.670 align:middle line:90%
existential consciousness.

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:09.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's that stuff
that keeps us alive.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:13.480 align:middle line:84%
It's our intuition, our
instincts, and the taste.

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:19.450 align:middle line:84%
So the best way to recognize
the intelligence of the spleen

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:24.670 align:middle line:84%
is when you're sick or
when you're pregnant.

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:27.862 align:middle line:84%
When you're pregnant, all your
senses are really highlighted.

00:46:27.862 --> 00:46:29.820 align:middle line:84%
So this is good for me,
that's not good for me.

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:31.300 align:middle line:90%
There is a deep, deep, deep--

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Knowing.

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:33.707 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS:
--intelligence in there

00:46:33.707 --> 00:46:36.400 align:middle line:84%
that is shared over
all life forces.

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.890 align:middle line:84%
So you look at a
design of a plant,

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:40.348 align:middle line:84%
or you look at the design of
an insect, or whatever mammal,

00:46:40.348 --> 00:46:41.408 align:middle line:90%
they all have a spleen.

00:46:41.408 --> 00:46:42.700 align:middle line:90%
They all have a splenic center.

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
the one thing

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:45.190 align:middle line:90%
that we all share in common.

00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: Yes.

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:48.208 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and we
didn't go to the very top,

00:46:48.208 --> 00:46:49.480 align:middle line:90%
above the ajna.

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: That's the
pressure in the head

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:54.800 align:middle line:84%
to try to make
sense out of life.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.210 align:middle line:84%
So you get a kid,
3, 4 years old--

00:46:58.210 --> 00:47:01.230 align:middle line:84%
why, why, why,
where, how, this--

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:04.180 align:middle line:84%
all this pressure in the
head that is trying to make

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:06.860 align:middle line:84%
sense out of what this
human experience is.

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:08.480 align:middle line:90%
So now we see.

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.240 align:middle line:84%
So you can kind of
see what mine's like.

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at Amy Winehouse,
an incredible talent,

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:15.610 align:middle line:90%
kind of tragic personal life.

00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:16.410 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:17.727 align:middle line:90%
Now, what's up with Amy?

00:47:17.727 --> 00:47:19.060 align:middle line:90%
She was a manifesting generator.

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:20.768 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: She's a
manifesting generator.

00:47:20.768 --> 00:47:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
interesting about Amy,

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:28.605 align:middle line:84%
she has all the life forces
that are defined, we call.

00:47:28.605 --> 00:47:29.405 align:middle line:90%
We say defined.

00:47:29.405 --> 00:47:30.353 align:middle line:90%
It's a terminology.

00:47:30.353 --> 00:47:31.520 align:middle line:90%
But they're just colored in.

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.590 align:middle line:90%
Those channels are colored in.

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:36.220 align:middle line:84%
The channels that are
colored in in her design,

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:39.770 align:middle line:84%
they are all about
empowerment, and they're all

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:42.862 align:middle line:84%
about creativity, and
they're all about melancholy.

00:47:42.862 --> 00:47:43.820 align:middle line:90%
And they're all about--

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Melancholy.

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:46.768 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: And they're
all about individuality.

00:47:46.768 --> 00:47:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ah, that was her life.

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: These frequencies,
they are very acoustic.

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:54.100 align:middle line:84%
OK, so here you've
got a blues singer

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.170 align:middle line:84%
in the end that gives
expression to all these

00:47:57.170 --> 00:48:01.220 align:middle line:84%
(HUSKILY) deep kind of feelings
that are sitting there.

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, there's
something underneath that says,

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:08.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm self-empowered or not.

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:12.360 align:middle line:84%
There is an expression of
self-empowerment or not.

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:17.240 align:middle line:10%
Now, when you drag
that into the mind,

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:21.740 align:middle line:10%
and you go to an open
spleen and an open heart,

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:28.340 align:middle line:10%
you are looking at somebody that
is actually very, very insecure

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:33.820 align:middle line:10%
about herself and about
her own artistic expression

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:34.990 align:middle line:10%
at some level or another.

00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:39.312 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of "I don't
know if I'm worth it."

00:48:39.312 --> 00:48:41.020 align:middle line:10%
And so this is somebody
that, in the end,

00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:47.050 align:middle line:10%
through all the melancholy
that went on in her life,

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:51.220 align:middle line:10%
and this potential of being
either self-empowered or

00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:54.850 align:middle line:10%
disempowered and
depressed, there's

00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:56.740 align:middle line:10%
this possibility of
dragging all of that

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:59.380 align:middle line:10%
through a mental approach into
a hole that it shouldn't be.

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, which
ultimately happened.

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: Yeah.

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh gosh,
if we can do--

00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:05.490 align:middle line:90%
do you want to do one more?

00:49:05.490 --> 00:49:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: Yeah,
yeah, of course.

00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:08.178 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's go
ahead and pull up--

00:49:08.178 --> 00:49:09.220 align:middle line:90%
should we do Frida Kahlo?

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: Yeah,
Frida Kahlo, yeah.

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's say pull her up.

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:15.250 align:middle line:90%
And there she is.

00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:17.900 align:middle line:84%
And we only have about a
minute, about a minute left.

00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>NELLENS: Yeah, Frida
Kahlo is all about emoting.

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Emoting.

00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: Yes.

00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Frida Kahlo.

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:24.760 align:middle line:84%
was like, here's a
new spirit in life.

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Like I'm bringing you something
that you've never seen.

00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:29.230 align:middle line:90%
And she's a perfectionist.

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:33.940 align:middle line:84%
So this is somebody that, in
that emotional expression,

00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:36.578 align:middle line:84%
gives you something that
has to do with, yeah,

00:49:36.578 --> 00:49:38.120 align:middle line:84%
but not like this,
and not like that,

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.870 align:middle line:84%
and putting it here,
and putting it there.

00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm actually
accentuating certain things

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:44.350 align:middle line:90%
that make me love me more.

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:49.173 align:middle line:84%
So she is very, very eccentric
in a way as a design.

00:49:49.173 --> 00:49:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And obviously she
is a manifestor.

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:55.930 align:middle line:84%
She is here to have
impact on life.

00:49:55.930 --> 00:49:58.730 align:middle line:84%
In her life expression,
obviously, that impact

00:49:58.730 --> 00:49:59.530 align:middle line:90%
was huge.

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:02.680 align:middle line:90%
We're out of time.

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:03.730 align:middle line:90%
To me, it's fascinating.

00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:08.770 align:middle line:84%
I have to say that I find human
design particularly useful--

00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:11.050 align:middle line:84%
useful to use as your
own understanding

00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:15.200 align:middle line:84%
of your own operating manual
how you interface with life.

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.110 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just saying that
on a personal level.

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:18.830 align:middle line:90%
I have a lot of respect for it.

00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:20.860 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I really
appreciate the fact

00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:24.040 align:middle line:84%
you've chosen to take so
much time, A, to be here,

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.200 align:middle line:84%
but also so many years
to really delve into it

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:27.910 align:middle line:84%
and your deeper
understanding yourself,

00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:29.080 align:middle line:90%
and sharing that with us.

00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: Thank you very much.

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you so
much for being here.

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:32.433 align:middle line:90%
>>NELLENS: Thanks for having me.

00:50:32.433 --> 00:50:34.690 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: You can go
to DirkNellens.com

00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:37.360 align:middle line:10%
