00:00:20.063 --> 00:00:22.230 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: The
subject of parallel realities

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.230 align:middle line:10%
is emerging more and more
prominent in our conversation

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.500 align:middle line:10%
as we begin to understand the
complex nature of reality.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.750 align:middle line:84%
When it crosses over
into the dreamworld,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.970 align:middle line:90%
it becomes really interesting.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.890 align:middle line:10%
Author Robert Moss
has given us yet

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.640 align:middle line:10%
even more to think about in this
book, "Mysterious Realities."

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.600 align:middle line:84%
It recounts experiences of both
parallel existences and dream

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.860 align:middle line:84%
time, where they
clash and cross over.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.015 align:middle line:90%
And this is such a fun book.

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT MOSS:
Thank you, Regina.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.110 align:middle line:90%
Great to be with you.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, it's
kind of outrageous.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.740 align:middle line:84%
It has a lot of
outrageous stuff in there.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And so first of all,
I've interviewed

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.950 align:middle line:90%
you a couple of other times.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.360 align:middle line:84%
We've stayed very pointed on the
subject of dreams and methods

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.160 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.990 align:middle line:84%
But this is a collection
of stories that

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.550 align:middle line:90%
are of your own experience.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.453 align:middle line:84%
And what prompted you
to write this book?

00:01:10.453 --> 00:01:11.870 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, I
think they're fun.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.590 align:middle line:10%
I think they are entertaining.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.500 align:middle line:10%
And I think they're
illuminating in the sense

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.170 align:middle line:10%
that they can provoke people
into thinking about what

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.790 align:middle line:10%
is possible for them.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:20.930 align:middle line:10%
You know, you go dreaming.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:21.863 align:middle line:10%
What does that mean?

00:01:21.863 --> 00:01:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Does it just mean that
what you ate last night

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.085 align:middle line:84%
is commenting on the
state of your digestion?

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Or does it mean that maybe
you traveled to another world?

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe someone from
another world visited you?

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So it is to break
open the carapace

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.780 align:middle line:84%
of our limited thinking
about these things.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, science tells
us as a hypothesis,

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.760 align:middle line:84%
we're living right now
in the many worlds,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.780 align:middle line:90%
in the nested parallel universe.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.280 align:middle line:84%
This is a popular
thesis in science.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
very hard for people

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.350 align:middle line:90%
to get their minds around.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.225 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: That's right.

00:01:48.225 --> 00:01:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In terms of our
visceral understanding.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Go ahead and explain
it the way you see it,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:84%
and science sees it, and
where that crosses over.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: When whoever
came up with this thesis

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.110 align:middle line:84%
many years ago, he was
laughed out of court.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.140 align:middle line:84%
But today physics thinks
it's quite tenable

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.430 align:middle line:84%
that we are living right now in
uncountable parallel universes.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And there's a universe
right next to us

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.450 align:middle line:84%
where you and I are not talking
at Gaia, et cetera, et cetera.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.908 align:middle line:84%
But as you say, how do we get
our heads around that notion?

00:02:14.908 --> 00:02:16.610 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean
to us if it's true?

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.180 align:middle line:84%
Well dreaming is one of the
ways to explore firsthand

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.310 align:middle line:84%
the possible reality
of the many worlds.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.290 align:middle line:84%
If you monitor your
dreams and journal

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.885 align:middle line:84%
them over time, if you
have dreams you remember,

00:02:26.885 --> 00:02:28.760 align:middle line:84%
you might notice that
again and again, you're

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.380 align:middle line:84%
in a situation which is not
exactly your present life

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.180 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.120 align:middle line:84%
You're still with your former
partner or in your former job.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And that could mean
that part of you

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.260 align:middle line:84%
stayed behind through what
shamans call soul loss.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.940 align:middle line:84%
But it also means
that part of you

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.040 align:middle line:84%
is living on that
parallel track having

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.020 align:middle line:90%
made a choice you didn't make.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.760 align:middle line:84%
What good is it to
understand this?

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Well sometimes we
discover that we

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.250 align:middle line:84%
can harvest lessons and gifts
from our parallel selves who

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.080 align:middle line:84%
might have done something
we haven't done.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:84%
There's that parallel
you who became

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.490 align:middle line:84%
the musician or the artist
when you thought you just had

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.200 align:middle line:90%
to earn money and do the job.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can reach to
that parallel self who

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.670 align:middle line:84%
has those creative
gifts, and bring those

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.805 align:middle line:90%
into your present life.

00:03:05.805 --> 00:03:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Oh gosh, I mean, I could be
so rude and totally Bogart

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.740 align:middle line:84%
the mic here and say, oh,
I remember this dream,

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.610 align:middle line:90%
I remember that.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.990 align:middle line:84%
But I am going to try to
zip it and not do that.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.980 align:middle line:84%
But I will say one thing,
if I may, before we launch

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.320 align:middle line:90%
into these incredible stories.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.420 align:middle line:84%
I notice in the dream
world, this one thing

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.690 align:middle line:84%
I've always been intrigued with
is there is an alternate world.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.510 align:middle line:84%
In my case, I go to an alternate
world that's like Earth

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.890 align:middle line:90%
but not exactly like Earth.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.810 align:middle line:90%
Everything's different to scale.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.640 align:middle line:84%
You're capable of
different things.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a city within a
city that I know well.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.160 align:middle line:84%
I even know which shops to go
to in that city, which cafes.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's buried in the
middle of another city.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And each time in the dream
it's like, oh my home,

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm in Rome this time.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.340 align:middle line:90%
There's the wall to my city.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just saying I
have had a lifetime

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.600 align:middle line:90%
of going into these parallel--

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was
dreamworld, but it appears

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.797 align:middle line:90%
it's just a parallel reality.

00:03:57.797 --> 00:03:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Regina, you've
got a wonderful book.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.510 align:middle line:84%
And you are a shopper's
guide to alternate realities.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's crazy.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: It has to be done.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Bakeries
in particular.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Well you know, there's a
phrase, the imaginable realm.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not a household phrase
yet but it might become one.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.570 align:middle line:84%
It means that there
realms of true imagination

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.279 align:middle line:84%
where there are
cities and temples

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:23.090 align:middle line:84%
and palaces and shopping malls
created by human imagination

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.700 align:middle line:84%
over the centuries, over
the millennia actually.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And they're arguably
not less real or not

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.180 align:middle line:84%
much less real
than anything made

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.150 align:middle line:84%
of bricks and mortar and
glass and steel in this world

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.170 align:middle line:90%
that we live in.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And actually shamans,
creators, mystics have always

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:84%
wanted to go to these
places, these places

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.810 align:middle line:90%
of true imagination.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.690 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of my stories
in "Mysterious Realities"

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.780 align:middle line:84%
are about travels
in this architecture

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.043 align:middle line:90%
of non-ordinary reality.

00:04:46.043 --> 00:04:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So how do we know?

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.668 align:middle line:84%
Like in that case,
how would I know

00:04:48.668 --> 00:04:51.620 align:middle line:84%
if I'm dropping into just
a constant parallel reality

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.070 align:middle line:84%
that I dip into, or if it's an
imaginary realm that I created?

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.743 align:middle line:84%
Or is there any
difference anyway?

00:04:57.743 --> 00:04:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: There may not
be that much difference.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.285 align:middle line:84%
Because I mean,
everything in the world

00:05:01.285 --> 00:05:03.710 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking in
right now is the product

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.470 align:middle line:84%
actually of human
imagination and intersecting

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.650 align:middle line:84%
with the materials
of the planet Earth.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.360 align:middle line:84%
There's no building
on the planet Earth

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.700 align:middle line:84%
that is not the result of
imagination, for example.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.803 align:middle line:84%
So it's the same in non-ordinary
reality, ultimate reality.

00:05:16.803 --> 00:05:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And arguably, there
are structures there

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.012 align:middle line:84%
that are older than
the Eiffel Tower,

00:05:20.012 --> 00:05:23.000 align:middle line:84%
older than the pyramids that
have been constructed again

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.270 align:middle line:90%
by imagination.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.780 align:middle line:84%
These include the environments
we go when we die.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.402 align:middle line:84%
They include the bardo states,
the transitional zones.

00:05:29.402 --> 00:05:30.860 align:middle line:84%
So all of this is
quite interesting

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.920 align:middle line:84%
if you want to know something
about your options after death.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm very interested
in that subject.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.840 align:middle line:84%
I find the people who have some
kind of firsthand experience

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.120 align:middle line:84%
or idea about what
happens after death tend

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.920 align:middle line:84%
to approach the
challenges of this life

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.050 align:middle line:84%
with more courage
and clarity and even

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.570 align:middle line:90%
a sense of divine comedy.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.038 align:middle line:84%
So some of my stories are
about, let's get humorous

00:05:49.038 --> 00:05:50.330 align:middle line:90%
about what happens after death.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.440 align:middle line:90%
Let's have a look at it.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Let's not be too drab
and mournful about it,

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.305 align:middle line:84%
but let's be brave enough
to take a good look.

00:05:56.305 --> 00:05:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well what a
wonderful segue because we're

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.055 align:middle line:84%
going right up to
something you thought

00:06:00.055 --> 00:06:02.105 align:middle line:84%
might have been your death
at one point in time.

00:06:02.105 --> 00:06:03.230 align:middle line:90%
We're going to go through--

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.900 align:middle line:84%
I've chosen a few stories
in the because obviously we

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.130 align:middle line:84%
can't cover them all or this
would be a six part mini

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.930 align:middle line:90%
series.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.310 align:middle line:84%
So given the
constraints of time,

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.100 align:middle line:84%
let's start with the
storytelling of crows.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, did this
really happen to you?

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:17.390 align:middle line:90%
Happened in an airport.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.580 align:middle line:90%
Let's set the stage.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well the story as
told in "Mysterious Realities"

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.150 align:middle line:84%
starts with me slipping at
Sea-Tac Airport, Seattle

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.230 align:middle line:90%
Airport.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And my body is horizontal
above a hard surface.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
come down very hard.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.270 align:middle line:90%
And I can hear people screaming.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.220 align:middle line:84%
But it's as if there's
a giant hand that

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.940 align:middle line:84%
is sustaining me and holding
me up, breaking this fall.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And in this moment,
I go off into if you

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.978 align:middle line:84%
like an imaginary
world in which I

00:06:44.978 --> 00:06:46.520 align:middle line:84%
am talking as if
I've been pulled out

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.230 align:middle line:90%
of my body for a while.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking to one of my
preferred forms of the death

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.280 align:middle line:90%
lord, Yama.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Yama well-known in
India and in the east.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm having a
conversation with the Yama

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.550 align:middle line:84%
who is not in a good
mood to begin with.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.130 align:middle line:84%
He is showing himself as a
sort of steaming mountain

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.920 align:middle line:84%
with boar tusks and all
sorts of other appendages--

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.380 align:middle line:90%
not very nice at all.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.140 align:middle line:84%
We have an interview about
what would make it worthwhile

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:84%
for me to be allowed to go
on living in this earth.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And what Yama basically
tells me is you

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.668 align:middle line:84%
must go on making stories
that entertain death.

00:07:16.668 --> 00:07:18.710 align:middle line:84%
So I guess that's the real
answer to your opening

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:19.160 align:middle line:90%
question.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.243 align:middle line:84%
I wrote this book because
these are stories that I

00:07:21.243 --> 00:07:22.780 align:middle line:90%
think entertain my death.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And as the story unfolds,
there are episodes from my life

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.630 align:middle line:90%
and different realities.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And I want to share one that
took place on an airplane,

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.510 align:middle line:84%
flying back from that
airport where I had the fall.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And also at some point tie
into the storytelling songs

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.310 align:middle line:90%
of a dead dreamer.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
an important part.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.490 align:middle line:90%
Now weave it all together.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: OK.

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.540 align:middle line:90%
So back to Sea-Tac Airport.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm stopping at the
newsstand and they've

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.040 align:middle line:84%
got an interesting collection
of Penguin Classics.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's one called
"Songs Of A Dead Dreamer."

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.420 align:middle line:90%
I've never heard of this book.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a collection
of horror stories

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:58.430 align:middle line:90%
by an author unknown to me.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:00.140 align:middle line:90%
But I can't resist the title.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.660 align:middle line:84%
The cover is gruesome,
but I can't resist.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.530 align:middle line:84%
So in my hand is "Songs
Of The Dead Dream."

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.480 align:middle line:84%
But when I suddenly slip
on a spill of liquid,

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm horizontal above
the hard surface.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.060 align:middle line:90%
Come down hard.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.268 align:middle line:84%
And people gathered around
when I come back from my--

00:08:13.268 --> 00:08:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: About to
become a dead dreamer.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: --when I come
back from my sort of close

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.315 align:middle line:84%
to death experience,
people are gathered.

00:08:21.315 --> 00:08:22.190 align:middle line:90%
Should we call 9-1-1?

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.240 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm OK, I say.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.170 align:middle line:90%
I get up.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.117 align:middle line:84%
I'm slightly sore
along one of my sides,

00:08:27.117 --> 00:08:28.950 align:middle line:84%
but really I haven't
suffered anything much.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.070 align:middle line:90%
It's incomprehensible.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:31.489 align:middle line:90%
It was a really hard fall.

00:08:31.489 --> 00:08:32.289 align:middle line:90%
But I'm fine.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And you're a big guy.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:33.740 align:middle line:90%
You're tall.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:34.657 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: I'm a big guy.

00:08:34.657 --> 00:08:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And I should have
damaged something.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.150 align:middle line:84%
But it was like one
of those moments

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.440 align:middle line:90%
when you feel rejuvenated.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.559 align:middle line:84%
Something the deeper reality
has reached into your world

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:84%
and grabbed you to
get your attention.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.510 align:middle line:84%
In the experience of
coincidence or synchronicity,

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.410 align:middle line:90%
we often feel this.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.550 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
as dramatic as my fall

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.310 align:middle line:90%
on that airport concourse.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.690 align:middle line:90%
But don't we feel that?

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.910 align:middle line:84%
When interesting
synchronicity is happening,

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.530 align:middle line:84%
we feel that
something is reaching

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.790 align:middle line:84%
through the curtains of
our ordinary understanding

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.590 align:middle line:84%
to tickle us awake,
or mess up our hair,

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:07.250 align:middle line:84%
or pull something from under
us to get our attention,

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.050 align:middle line:84%
to push us forward
or pull us back.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I felt at that moment that
something had literally

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.480 align:middle line:84%
reached into my reality,
pulled me into another reality

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.810 align:middle line:84%
to remind me of something
fundamental about my life

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.690 align:middle line:84%
assignment right now, and
then laid me down gently.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.150 align:middle line:84%
So the physical
body was still OK.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.430 align:middle line:84%
It felt like one of
those interventions.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And I would say the intervention
from my point of view

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.615 align:middle line:84%
was by no less than
my personal death.

00:09:30.615 --> 00:09:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Communicated with me.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:32.948 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's
talk about what

00:09:32.948 --> 00:09:34.130 align:middle line:90%
happens on the return trip.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.838 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: On the return
trip, I'm wondering

00:09:35.838 --> 00:09:37.610 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen
next, of course.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.570 align:middle line:84%
I play this game on
airplanes all the time.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.870 align:middle line:84%
It's part of my survival
strategy as a frequent flyer.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.450 align:middle line:84%
What story is this
flight going to get me?

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And the story looks
almost over the top.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a very tall
woman, her height

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.130 align:middle line:84%
increased by her high heeled
black boots and her top hat

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:53.360 align:middle line:90%
that has capping her outfit.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Black leather over a bustier.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's in this
dimension in reality,

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.192 align:middle line:90%
on the airplane with you.

00:09:57.192 --> 00:09:59.205 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: This is in
physical reality.

00:09:59.205 --> 00:10:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When I was reading
it, I thought, I'm confused.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Was she in his
imagination or what?

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: This is
exactly playing out.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:06.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not hyped at all.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.623 align:middle line:84%
The story is told in
a just-so fashion.

00:10:08.623 --> 00:10:10.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she
has a top hat on.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: She's got a top hat.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:11.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: High books.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:12.607 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Black leather.

00:10:12.607 --> 00:10:14.565 align:middle line:90%
High heeled high boots.

00:10:14.565 --> 00:10:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And of course she
sits down next to me.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.198 align:middle line:84%
And she parks a small
rotund guy by the window.

00:10:19.198 --> 00:10:20.240 align:middle line:90%
She's sitting next to me.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.040 align:middle line:90%
And she's sniffing.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And she looks around and says,
I rather like this flight.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.280 align:middle line:90%
And I look at her.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.390 align:middle line:84%
This is the start
of the conversation.

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:27.620 align:middle line:90%
All the seats are full.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Don't you know, if the plane
is going to crash actuarially,

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.010 align:middle line:90%
20% of the seats will be empty.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.410 align:middle line:84%
This is what she says to me
to start the conversation.

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So I look at her
outfit more closely.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And she's wearing clothes
with big death's heads

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.390 align:middle line:90%
on the back of the gloves.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.068 align:middle line:84%
And I've been thinking
about death and my--

00:10:46.068 --> 00:10:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you have your
dead dreamer right there.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: --arrangement
with death.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And the conversation
is sort of gusting.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.880 align:middle line:90%
She reveals she's a dominatrix.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not really my scene.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.210 align:middle line:84%
So after that, things
are silent for a while

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.200 align:middle line:90%
and then we pick up.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.340 align:middle line:90%
She wants creme de menthe.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.140 align:middle line:90%
They don't have it.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.292 align:middle line:90%
She's having double vodka.

00:11:00.292 --> 00:11:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Then she says to me,
with knowing nothing

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.680 align:middle line:90%
about me in ordinary reality--

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.970 align:middle line:84%
do you think the dead
talk to us in our dreams?

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.050 align:middle line:90%
I say, absolutely.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:07.980 align:middle line:90%
Oh, good, she says.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.370 align:middle line:84%
My dead ex-husband turned
up last week in my dream.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:84%
He stood over my bed and he
said I've got a great job.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm making movies
and doing music--

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.610 align:middle line:84%
the dreams that are being made
for people in film studios

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:21.540 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.300 align:middle line:84%
I really love my job making
dream movies for people

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.670 align:middle line:90%
to watch in the night.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:26.470 align:middle line:90%
So this is good.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:27.887 align:middle line:84%
We have a conversation
about that.

00:11:27.887 --> 00:11:30.180 align:middle line:84%
I still haven't identified
myself in any way.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.130 align:middle line:90%
But let's cut to the chase.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.320 align:middle line:84%
She says, I love
crows and ravens.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Of course you do,
my dear, I say.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:36.725 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No surprise.

00:11:36.725 --> 00:11:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Do you know
there's a collective noun

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.260 align:middle line:90%
for a group of crows or ravens?

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, I'm very proud.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a murder of crows,
an unkindness of ravens.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.410 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knows that, she says.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.390 align:middle line:84%
There's one word
that applies to both.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.900 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what it is?

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.900 align:middle line:90%
You're going to tell me.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.330 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I am, dear--

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.340 align:middle line:84%
a storytelling of crows,
a storytelling of ravens.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Do you know why this is
the name for a collective

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.330 align:middle line:90%
of these black birds?

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:00.330 align:middle line:90%
You're going to tell me.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.390 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I am, because
you need to hear this.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.680 align:middle line:90%
I once saw this.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.020 align:middle line:84%
I saw a storytelling
crows gathered

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.870 align:middle line:84%
around a crow that was trying
to entertain them with a story.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.490 align:middle line:90%
He was a poor storyteller.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.875 align:middle line:84%
When he finished, they
pecked him to death.

00:12:13.875 --> 00:12:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.740 align:middle line:90%
I remember that in the book.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.338 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: And I have
my deal with my death

00:12:19.338 --> 00:12:21.630 align:middle line:84%
to go on producing stories
that are entertaining Death.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And she's telling me
a story about crows--

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.050 align:middle line:84%
black birds,
harbingers of death--

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.560 align:middle line:84%
which involves the
penalty for failing

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.910 align:middle line:84%
to be an entertaining
storyteller.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:33.420 align:middle line:84%
So once again, the real
reason I composed this book,

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.230 align:middle line:84%
or put it together for
my experiences, is--

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.313 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You had the fear
of the crows put it in.

00:12:37.313 --> 00:12:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Yes, the
crows made me do it.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [CHUCKLES] I love it.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And you have done it
successfully, I want to say.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think one thing
that just popped out

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:49.670 align:middle line:84%
there-- people are saying,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And that-- well, there
are a lot of things.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.790 align:middle line:84%
But one of them
was this notion--

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.170 align:middle line:90%
actuarially speaking.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.227 align:middle line:90%
Not actually speaking--

00:12:56.227 --> 00:12:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Actuarially.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Speaking
as an actuary, which

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.755 align:middle line:84%
is someone who really knows how
to crunch numbers and ratios.

00:13:01.755 --> 00:13:02.850 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes, yes.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is that true?

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.120 align:middle line:90%
Where did that come from?

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.790 align:middle line:84%
That's interesting because
that indicates something else.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:12.420 align:middle line:84%
If 20% of the seats are empty
on flights that go down,

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.637 align:middle line:84%
that means somehow, some people
got somewhere and probably

00:13:15.637 --> 00:13:17.845 align:middle line:84%
canceled at the last minute
not to be on that flight.

00:13:17.845 --> 00:13:18.645 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Right.

00:13:18.645 --> 00:13:20.430 align:middle line:84%
I did not fact-check
the dominatrix

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:21.120 align:middle line:90%
with the deaths on gloves.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just find
that interesting.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.102 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: But I have seen--

00:13:23.102 --> 00:13:26.520 align:middle line:84%
I've seen similar information
in news reports over the years.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.140 align:middle line:84%
I did not fact-check
that version.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, just wondering.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:30.352 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: But I've heard
things like that.

00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think there is a
certain body of evidence

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:35.070 align:middle line:84%
that there will be empty seats
when the plane or the train,

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:35.940 align:middle line:84%
or something else
is going to crash.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you're on
a packed flight-- good,

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.732 align:middle line:90%
because we're flying out today.

00:13:38.732 --> 00:13:39.755 align:middle line:90%
So all, right, now--

00:13:39.755 --> 00:13:40.555 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: [LAUGHS]

00:13:40.555 --> 00:13:41.426 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:13:41.426 --> 00:13:42.240 align:middle line:90%


00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.320 align:middle line:84%
So now we know why you did
this, why this book exists.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.540 align:middle line:84%
You're here to tell
stories in such a way

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.360 align:middle line:84%
that you're not, essentially,
pecked to death, right?

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.360 align:middle line:90%
So that's your job.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.443 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Wonderful summary.

00:13:53.443 --> 00:13:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now let's
go on to a next--

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.018 align:middle line:84%
let's go on to the
next story I chose.

00:13:57.018 --> 00:13:58.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
many, many stories.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I found this
absolutely fascinating--

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.280 align:middle line:84%
you visited, in Hampstead,
right, in England--

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --in
London, Hampstead?

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You visited
the final home of Freud.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He's not
exactly who I thought

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:15.300 align:middle line:84%
he was by your
rendering of this story.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Please tell us about this
man who is much more complex,

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.840 align:middle line:84%
who claims to be
an atheist, and yet

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.407 align:middle line:84%
is surrounded by very unusual
artifacts, lots of them.

00:14:26.407 --> 00:14:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: It is-- you
can actually visit

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.573 align:middle line:84%
Freud's last home
in Hampstead and you

00:14:29.573 --> 00:14:31.440 align:middle line:90%
can see this for yourself.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.480 align:middle line:84%
In his house, his
last house, are

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.050 align:middle line:84%
about 2,000 miniature statues
of deities and spirits

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:39.870 align:middle line:84%
from many cultures, particularly
from the ancient Mediterranean,

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.540 align:middle line:84%
ancient Egypt, that part of
the world, but also from China,

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:43.620 align:middle line:90%
and other places.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.290 align:middle line:84%
He called these his
old and grubby gods.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:47.970 align:middle line:84%
He would go nowhere
without them.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.400 align:middle line:84%
In Vienna, before he had
to flee, he had 3,000.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.470 align:middle line:84%
He managed to bring
2,000 to London.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.540 align:middle line:84%
He would not travel
without a selection

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.750 align:middle line:84%
of his divine statues,
a suitcase full.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.790 align:middle line:84%
When he was consulting
with a client,

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.310 align:middle line:84%
he would arrange the
answerers, as he sometimes

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.460 align:middle line:84%
called them, the statues, the
embodied, spirited statues--

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.500 align:middle line:84%
the breathing images,
the Greeks called them--

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.770 align:middle line:84%
who would counsel him on his
relationship with a patient.

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, if he was
dealing with a tricky case,

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.810 align:middle line:84%
he'd station a particular
divine statue between him

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:17.940 align:middle line:84%
and the patient
to keep a border,

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.160 align:middle line:84%
to keep some kind
of guardianship

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.600 align:middle line:90%
over the situation.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.450 align:middle line:84%
So he might have been a godless
Jew, as he called himself,

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.210 align:middle line:84%
but he did firmly believe
to and adhere to what he

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:29.310 align:middle line:90%
called his old and grubby gods.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And in this story, I write about
his actually very affectionate

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:35.010 align:middle line:84%
relationship with
an image of Horus,

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:37.770 align:middle line:90%
which there's history here.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.930 align:middle line:84%
He did have an image of
Horus, which is probably

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.790 align:middle line:84%
a counterfeit in the sense
it wasn't from ancient Egypt.

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:46.350 align:middle line:84%
It was from the 19th century
made by a very good faker.

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And in the story,
Freud's affection

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.690 align:middle line:84%
for the image of
Horus is strong.

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And we know that in his dreams
of what happened to his parents

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.790 align:middle line:84%
after death, he saw Horus
as a guide, an escort,

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.610 align:middle line:84%
so we know he had a
certain sympathy for Horus.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:02.340 align:middle line:84%
In the story, it is brought
to Freud's attention

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.080 align:middle line:84%
that his statue is
probably a fake,

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.270 align:middle line:84%
but he basically says,
no, no, it's for real.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:07.503 align:middle line:90%
This is how gods are made.

00:16:07.503 --> 00:16:08.670 align:middle line:90%
They're made by your belief.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:10.150 align:middle line:90%
They're made by your faith.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's very interesting
to me that Freud, whatever

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:17.370 align:middle line:84%
his umbrella ideology, in
practice, talked to his gods,

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:20.542 align:middle line:84%
to the embodied image of the
gods the way the ancients did.

00:16:20.542 --> 00:16:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Because all of these
statues were made for use.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.300 align:middle line:90%
They were made as conveyances.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.970 align:middle line:84%
They were made as vehicles
for the gods and the spirits

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.100 align:middle line:84%
to speak to humans and
interact with them.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And Freud used them exactly
the way in ancient pagan

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.050 align:middle line:90%
would have done.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that, to me,
was absolutely fascinating.

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.560 align:middle line:84%
What he really meant is
I'm not a practicing--

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.020 align:middle line:84%
a member of the practicing
Judeo-Christian faith.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Right.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what he was saying.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Right.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not that I'm godless.

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:46.050 align:middle line:84%
He was deeply entrenched
with the gods.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, they
were guiding him,

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.150 align:middle line:84%
and they were even used
as divination tools,

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.950 align:middle line:90%
almost, for him.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:51.828 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Absolutely.

00:16:51.828 --> 00:16:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank you
for sharing that.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:54.938 align:middle line:84%
I find that absolutely
fascinating.

00:16:54.938 --> 00:16:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And like you said, he used to
carry this one little kind of--

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.170 align:middle line:84%
I think you said
reddish version of what

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:04.109 align:middle line:84%
turned out to be a fake,
apparently, of Horus.

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And he carried it
with him at all times

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.180 align:middle line:90%
as the great protector god.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And he said-- in
your book, the way

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:15.780 align:middle line:84%
you position it is, it
doesn't matter if it's a fake.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:90%
I gave him life.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Well--

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.977 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: My belief
gave him life.

00:17:18.977 --> 00:17:20.579 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes, these things are--

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:23.207 align:middle line:84%
these things like "The
Velveteen Rabbit" story.

00:17:23.207 --> 00:17:24.290 align:middle line:90%
These things are ensouled.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:27.180 align:middle line:84%
They're inspirited by
belief, by faith, by love.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:28.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, they are.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to go to
another one that has

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.750 align:middle line:90%
to do with statues and spirits.

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Because this story, I was
kind of horrified at first,

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:38.400 align:middle line:90%
but I start laughing.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with
you and our great goddess.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.520 align:middle line:84%
You'll never be
disrespectful to her again--

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.055 align:middle line:90%
Artemis.

00:17:46.055 --> 00:17:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: You are making
me really nervous now.

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:49.800 align:middle line:90%


00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.120 align:middle line:90%
I want to go there next.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: OK.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.203 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about what happened.

00:17:53.203 --> 00:17:56.100 align:middle line:84%
This story starts in Istanbul
and it ends in Greece,

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.532 align:middle line:90%
if I recall, right?

00:17:57.532 --> 00:17:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, it's played
out in the Greek part

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:00.600 align:middle line:90%
of what is now Turkey.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.420 align:middle line:84%
It's basically played out in
the Western part of Turkey.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, thank you.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: It's played out at
Ephesus, the famous city

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.040 align:middle line:90%
of the great goddess Artemis.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's denouement is played
out not far from Izmir,

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:17.820 align:middle line:84%
a famous seaport
on the Aegean Sea.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
self-mocking story.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.325 align:middle line:84%
It's the story of my getting
myself into mythic trouble.

00:18:22.325 --> 00:18:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and I'm
trying to remember her name.

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:27.060 align:middle line:84%
I have it somewhere here, but
I'm hopping all over myself.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.860 align:middle line:90%
The woman that you were with--

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:29.670 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:30.545 align:middle line:90%
OK, what is her name?

00:18:30.545 --> 00:18:31.560 align:middle line:90%
It starts with an A.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I called her
Asli in the story.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.514 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Asli.

00:18:33.514 --> 00:18:33.760 align:middle line:90%
OK, yes.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.385 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I called her
Asli in the story.

00:18:35.385 --> 00:18:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So it probably really begins at
the ancient temple of Apollo,

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:41.550 align:middle line:90%
in these parts.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.792 align:middle line:84%
And I'm there with
some of my group, who

00:18:43.792 --> 00:18:45.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to lead a workshop.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.583 align:middle line:84%
And there aren't
many tourists around,

00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:49.680 align:middle line:84%
so I say, let's chant the words
that awaken an ancient god.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:55.518 align:middle line:84%
So we're chanting, in ancient
Greek, words to awaken Apollo.

00:18:55.518 --> 00:18:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And a Dutch friend
of the group says,

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Robert, aren't
there consequences

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.060 align:middle line:90%
for awakening old gods?

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And I say, in my madness,
don't worry, dear boy.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.060 align:middle line:90%
They're family.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:03.992 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:19:03.992 --> 00:19:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Now think what it
means to announce that you're

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:07.290 align:middle line:84%
family with the
Greek gods, who were

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:10.230 align:middle line:84%
known as the most dysfunctional
family in all of literature.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.080 align:middle line:90%
It might have begun there.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.140 align:middle line:84%
So then, we were at
the museum in Ephesus,

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.220 align:middle line:84%
which has the famous many
breasts that-- if they

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.020 align:middle line:90%
are breasts.

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.895 align:middle line:84%
There's great discussion
about what they are.

00:19:18.895 --> 00:19:22.090 align:middle line:84%
But this huge figure, this
famous figure of Artemis,

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:25.270 align:middle line:84%
of Ephesus, who's not exactly
the Greek Artemis with the bow

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:26.250 align:middle line:90%
and arrow and the deer.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:27.125 align:middle line:90%
She's something more.

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:28.750 align:middle line:90%
She's also the mountain mother.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:29.768 align:middle line:90%
He's also Cybele.

00:19:29.768 --> 00:19:31.060 align:middle line:90%
She's also-- she's many things.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.620 align:middle line:90%
She's the great goddess.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And whether these are figs, or
bulls testicles, or breasts,

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.870 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, she
is a potent deity.

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And she's wearing a whole city,
or a whole nation on her head

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:41.660 align:middle line:90%
as a crown.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.980 align:middle line:10%
And opposite in the museum is
another version of the goddess,

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.440 align:middle line:10%
appearing somewhat
younger, somewhat daintier,

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.020 align:middle line:10%
somewhat more elegant,
somewhat more beautiful.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm standing between the
two living statues worshipped

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.510 align:middle line:84%
by hundreds of thousands of
people that have received

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:58.210 align:middle line:84%
their prayers, and I say,
pointing at the younger one,

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:02.320 align:middle line:84%
I think this is the one I'm
going to ask out for dinner.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.480 align:middle line:90%
The Turks in the room gasp.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.700 align:middle line:90%
The Turkish woman gasps.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:07.930 align:middle line:90%
Her color changes.

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Robert, she says, do you
know what you just did?

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.510 align:middle line:84%
You just insulted-- you just
insulted a deity worshipped

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.340 align:middle line:84%
by people for
thousands of years.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, I did make a--

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:17.680 align:middle line:90%
I did sort of overdo it.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.940 align:middle line:90%
It was just a cavalier remark.

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.170 align:middle line:90%
It was just a casual remark.

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:21.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm a boy, I'm like that.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.300 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.175 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just a lad.

00:20:24.175 --> 00:20:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: --there
are consequences.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.410 align:middle line:84%
One of the animals
with which are Artemis,

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.720 align:middle line:84%
in both the Greek and the
Anatolian forms associate,

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.520 align:middle line:90%
is the boar.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.530 align:middle line:84%
She's also associated
with the bear.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:34.210 align:middle line:84%
But we are down
on the beach the--

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now, wait a minute.

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:38.330 align:middle line:84%
Asli had-- she had a tea--
or she was reading her coffee

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:39.130 align:middle line:90%
grounds--

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:39.940 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --right, before
you went to the beach, right?

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: That's true, yes.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:43.420 align:middle line:90%
You're good.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I do remember
some things pretty well

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.120 align:middle line:90%
because I was engaged.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.457 align:middle line:84%
OK, and as she read them,
she saw the image of a boar--

00:20:50.457 --> 00:20:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: She saw the image of a--

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --and she shuddered.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: She saw the image
of a boar, a wild pig.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And the Greeks used to say
in the famous book on dream

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.152 align:middle line:84%
interpretation by Artemidorus--
from which Freud borrowed his

00:21:00.152 --> 00:21:00.952 align:middle line:90%
title--

00:21:00.952 --> 00:21:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Artemidorus says, when
the goddess is enraged,

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:90%
takes the form of a boar.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.900 align:middle line:84%
When women are enraged, they
can be as wild as a she-boar.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.668 align:middle line:84%
So some of us are on the
beach shortly after this.

00:21:10.668 --> 00:21:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beach where
there are wild boar,

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.752 align:middle line:84%
but the wild boar have never
been a problem for humans.

00:21:14.752 --> 00:21:16.780 align:middle line:90%
They've always coexisted.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.720 align:middle line:84%
But as we're making a picnic,
a wild boar runs at me--

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.780 align:middle line:90%
my back is turned--

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:21.580 align:middle line:90%
and bites me.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.680 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't tusk
me, but it bites me

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.180 align:middle line:84%
over the second chakra at the
back, making a very big hole--

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:27.347 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Near your kidneys.

00:21:27.347 --> 00:21:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: --and a
very large bruise.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And people are running
around, beating the boar away.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And the keeper of
the beach chair

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:37.650 align:middle line:84%
says, I've worked
here for 20 years.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:39.820 align:middle line:84%
No boars ever attacked
a human until now.

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Oh, things are
happening differently.

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:43.545 align:middle line:84%
When I eventually go
to a pharmacy and--

00:21:43.545 --> 00:21:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But didn't he-- did
he try to attack you again?

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.960 align:middle line:90%
Did he come back after you?

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.168 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: He seemed interested.

00:21:48.168 --> 00:21:50.980 align:middle line:84%
But by this point, there's
a very, very dominant

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Turkish woman with a big
stick who's keeping him away.

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:54.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so she's
getting him more off your--

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: But he's still
sniffing around-- or he or she.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.010 align:middle line:84%
He or she is still
sniff-- probably she--

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:00.340 align:middle line:90%
is still sniffing around.

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.700 align:middle line:84%
So I felt, in the most
intimate and personal way,

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.020 align:middle line:90%
the anger of the goddess.

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.970 align:middle line:90%
I had been bitten deeply--

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:10.150 align:middle line:84%
not tusk, but bitten deeply
over the second chakra

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.520 align:middle line:84%
by an animal associated
with the great goddess.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.275 align:middle line:84%
So I realized I have
to make reparations.

00:22:14.275 --> 00:22:15.400 align:middle line:90%
I have to make up for this.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you also were
stung by a bee after that.

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I was stung
by a bee, but that

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:19.370 align:middle line:90%
seemed to be natural medicine.

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was-- and so
that was the immune system.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Turkish
doctor on the beach

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:24.390 align:middle line:84%
said that it's as if the
bee decided to give you

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:25.830 align:middle line:90%
some immediate emergency help.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, which is cool.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: So notice, we
are in the mythic realm.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a complete interface,
a complete field of interaction

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:35.320 align:middle line:84%
between mythic forces and
ordinary human forces,

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.120 align:middle line:84%
and it's playing out
in my life because

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.340 align:middle line:84%
of a cavalier, idiotic
remark made in a museum.

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.140 align:middle line:90%
But I have to--

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.040 align:middle line:90%
I have to pay up now.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.210 align:middle line:90%
I have to make reparations.

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:45.430 align:middle line:84%
So I went and I made
apologies to the goddess

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:47.400 align:middle line:84%
and I offered gifts
of to the goddess.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.810 align:middle line:84%
I offered bread to the
god-- a gift of grain

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:51.280 align:middle line:90%
to the goddess of the earth.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And I invoked the support
of other feminine deities

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.510 align:middle line:84%
that have helped me, and
Athena and her allies

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:58.510 align:middle line:90%
were very helpful to me.

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And I went to her
sanctuary at Priene,

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.900 align:middle line:90%
and I felt at home there.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's a self-mocking
story about the consequences

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.378 align:middle line:84%
of not realizing that these
forces are still alive.

00:23:08.378 --> 00:23:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because
you-- and you were humble.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.160 align:middle line:90%
You said, I've been a silly boy.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Been a silly boy.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:13.990 align:middle line:90%
I was a silly boy.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.657 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when
you think about that,

00:23:15.657 --> 00:23:19.660 align:middle line:84%
and the whole
notion of egregores,

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:25.110 align:middle line:84%
certainly there can't be any
more prominent example of them

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:29.620 align:middle line:84%
than the entities that permeate
these statues that have long

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.950 align:middle line:84%
been regarded and honored
and worshipped and feared.

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:37.690 align:middle line:84%
So whether you're invoking
the original spirit,

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:41.950 align:middle line:84%
if that original spirit is still
attached to a-- permeating that

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:47.680 align:middle line:84%
particular piece of artwork,
or whether it's as you would--

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.780 align:middle line:84%
imaginal realm versus
the dream realm,

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.880 align:middle line:84%
or whether this is
now a collectively

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:55.540 align:middle line:84%
rendered reality, an entity
that we, as human beings have

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.800 align:middle line:90%
created, is kind of irrelevant.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.870 align:middle line:90%
It has its own life.

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:00.817 align:middle line:84%
It has its own mind and
its own force, right?

00:24:00.817 --> 00:24:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: That's very
well said, and thank you

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:03.760 align:middle line:90%
for the word egregore.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.740 align:middle line:84%
It was invented by
Victor Hugo, the poet,

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.690 align:middle line:84%
because he needed
a rhyme in a verse.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:10.295 align:middle line:84%
It didn't exist until he
decided to give us this word.

00:24:10.295 --> 00:24:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I didn't that
was origin of the word.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: That's the origin of
the word, but, of course--

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:13.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is an entity.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes, of course, it's a--

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a created entity.

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:16.535 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: --collective
thought form,

00:24:16.535 --> 00:24:19.100 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, some sometimes
anchored in and pinned

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:21.782 align:middle line:84%
to a particular form, a
statue or something like that.

00:24:21.782 --> 00:24:23.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's a collective
thought form.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And these collective
thought forms

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.510 align:middle line:84%
are active in our
lives in many ways.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:29.660 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the consequences
of saying silly words

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:30.980 align:middle line:90%
in front of an ancient statue.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.007 align:middle line:84%
But we see the potency
of the egregores,

00:24:33.007 --> 00:24:35.090 align:middle line:84%
of collective thought
forms, in all sorts of ways.

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:36.770 align:middle line:84%
We see them in bad
ways-s bringing

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:39.120 align:middle line:84%
racism and hatred
and dark forces,

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.240 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, as we've seen
recurringly in human history.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.710 align:middle line:84%
So we do need to think about and
understand how human thoughts

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and groups of people
sharing the same thought

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:50.810 align:middle line:84%
generate forms that have
their own psychic life,

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:51.730 align:middle line:90%
their own autonomy.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:52.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Because think about it,
Robert, look at even right

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.530 align:middle line:84%
now in the United States
and around the world where

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:00.560 align:middle line:84%
we have very kind of
prominent leaders,

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.720 align:middle line:84%
once we have an
opinion established

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:07.120 align:middle line:84%
en masse about that leader,
or a rock star, anyone that's

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.130 align:middle line:84%
prominent, all of that
energy is projected

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:11.660 align:middle line:90%
into that living persona.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:12.620 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
what happens to them

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:19.220 align:middle line:84%
if they're interfacing with
our collectively created sort

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.770 align:middle line:90%
of imaginable entity, of sorts?

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:25.520 align:middle line:84%
How does that
affect a human being

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.960 align:middle line:90%
who has their own persona?

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yeah.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've often wondered
how do those two meet?

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.500 align:middle line:84%
How do our beliefs
projected en masse

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.230 align:middle line:84%
onto another human
being affect them?

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, I
think many of us are

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:39.950 align:middle line:84%
living inside the
bubbles of reality

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:42.020 align:middle line:84%
created by thought
forms, or sustained

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.440 align:middle line:90%
by thought forms of this kind.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about
what to do about them,

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:48.200 align:middle line:84%
my mind actually runs off to
the old "Ghostbusters" movie.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.000 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.960 align:middle line:84%
There's this horrible
collective demonic being

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.720 align:middle line:84%
that's going to manifest
in the streets of the city.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.360 align:middle line:90%
You give it a ridiculous shape.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.320 align:middle line:90%
You shape-shift it.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.380 align:middle line:84%
You will it and wish it to
take a form that's manageable.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we need to
think about that.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we think about-- need
to think about not so much

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.860 align:middle line:84%
darkly demonizing these
forces we don't like,

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.560 align:middle line:84%
but making them so absolutely
preposterous and ridiculous

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.800 align:middle line:84%
that they sort of
self-destruct, self-implode

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.975 align:middle line:84%
because nobody, really,
can believe them anymore.

00:26:14.975 --> 00:26:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think
you should have

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:19.280 align:middle line:84%
the platform for just a
few moments, as in "The Day

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:23.000 align:middle line:84%
That the Earth Stood Still,"
and present this globally.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.580 align:middle line:84%
These things that we
resent and the things

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:28.970 align:middle line:84%
that we are putting so much
negative and dark energy into,

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:31.370 align:middle line:84%
let's turn them into
something almost comedic.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:32.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:34.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it would be
interesting to see how life

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:35.510 align:middle line:90%
would--

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.490 align:middle line:84%
literally have the feeling
of life would change.

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:40.415 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It would have to.

00:26:40.415 --> 00:26:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I'm a great
proponent of comedy.

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I think that actually, many
of us have in our lives

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.550 align:middle line:84%
might recognize
a moment where we

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:49.260 align:middle line:84%
have the choice of living the
genre of tragedy or of comedy.

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:50.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:51.647 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I chose
comedy some time ago.

00:26:51.647 --> 00:26:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think when we look at the
worst things that are going on

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:56.563 align:middle line:84%
in our world, it can be very
difficult to find any humor

00:26:56.563 --> 00:26:58.010 align:middle line:90%
in the situation to begin with.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:02.290 align:middle line:84%
But by finding that humor and
shape-shifting the reality,

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:05.390 align:middle line:84%
in a comedic sense, that
makes preposterous what

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:08.085 align:middle line:84%
might otherwise be terrifying,
we might find a way forward.

00:27:08.085 --> 00:27:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I think so.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.300 align:middle line:84%
A different kind of
egregore based on comedy--

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.890 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:15.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, now we're
speaking of entities.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Now we're in the realm
of another being.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.310 align:middle line:90%
And explain how this--

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:24.790 align:middle line:84%
did you end up calling
it a daimon or daemon?

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: It's very rude
to call it a demon.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I know.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Demon is the
ancient pronunciation,

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.655 align:middle line:84%
but because of the
church, we can't say that.

00:27:30.655 --> 00:27:31.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: D-A-I-M-O-N.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: D-A-I-M-O-N.
I like to say daimon.

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:36.160 align:middle line:84%
It might be more
correct to say daemon.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.650 align:middle line:90%
But basically, it's your call.

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: So I like to say daimon.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
this particular daimon and how

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:45.560 align:middle line:90%
this came to be--

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:90%
this story came to be.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.830 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, I'm
possibly the most lunar

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:49.930 align:middle line:90%
man you'll ever meet.

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:50.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:52.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lunar, OK.

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Most lunar--

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.645 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying lunatic,
but most lunar.

00:27:54.645 --> 00:27:56.270 align:middle line:84%
I've always felt
a strong affinity

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:57.720 align:middle line:84%
for the astral
realm of the Moon.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:58.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: And I've
always felt myself

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:02.840 align:middle line:84%
able to have some
degree of engagement

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.630 align:middle line:84%
with spirits, intelligences
that live in that realm.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:06.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a mixed role.

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
is an Earth realm.

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:09.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is an
Earth transit path.

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Closely
connected to Earth--

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:15.260 align:middle line:84%
in the belief of the ancient
philosophers that I like best,

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:18.300 align:middle line:84%
and the belief of Plutarch
and people like him,

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.730 align:middle line:84%
and the neo-platonists
in Greece,

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:21.890 align:middle line:84%
for example, the astral
realm of the Moon

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:23.930 align:middle line:84%
is the realm through
which we pass on our way

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:27.350 align:middle line:84%
to higher realms, and in which
we live behind an energy body,

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:28.730 align:middle line:84%
sometimes called
the astral body,

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:30.450 align:middle line:84%
that we're not going
to use anymore.

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:32.400 align:middle line:84%
It's also the realm
through which many of us

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.790 align:middle line:84%
transit on our way to
incarnation on Earth.

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and that's
a hermetic belief, as well.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.760 align:middle line:84%
This is our transit place
back and forth where we learn.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.920 align:middle line:84%
We make decisions,
come back to Earth--

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:43.830 align:middle line:90%
this lunar path.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Yes, so what's
accessible in the astral realm

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:47.030 align:middle line:90%
of the moon?

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:48.738 align:middle line:10%
Well, maybe it's a
place of understanding

00:28:48.738 --> 00:28:52.017 align:middle line:10%
some aspects of transitions
after death and before birth.

00:28:52.017 --> 00:28:54.350 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very useful in
life to understand something

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:56.780 align:middle line:84%
about what happens
before physical birth,

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:59.030 align:middle line:84%
and even before conception,
a little bit about what

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:00.710 align:middle line:90%
happens after physical death.

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:02.270 align:middle line:84%
The astral realm
of the Moon is not

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:03.728 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of
the end of it all,

00:29:03.728 --> 00:29:05.960 align:middle line:84%
but it's an interesting
transition place.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And the spirits
and intelligences

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.380 align:middle line:84%
of the realm of the Moon
have interesting things

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:10.180 align:middle line:90%
to contribute.

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.970 align:middle line:84%
So the book contains
conversations

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:16.300 align:middle line:84%
with a being who I call, and
who is content to be called,

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.520 align:middle line:90%
a daimon of Luna.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.590 align:middle line:84%
He has, if you ask
him, other names,

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:22.580 align:middle line:84%
but that's the
generic name for him.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And he talks a little bit
about his observations

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.662 align:middle line:84%
of human comings and
goings, and goings

00:29:26.662 --> 00:29:28.870 align:middle line:84%
in the realm of the Moon,
of different entities there

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:31.570 align:middle line:84%
that might be
influential among humans.

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:33.840 align:middle line:84%
I didn't include his guide
to the shopping precincts

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.060 align:middle line:84%
of the astral
realm of the Moon--

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, we'll
get into that.

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: But they're
very expensive.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:38.850 align:middle line:90%
They're very expensive.

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
first of all, he

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:43.270 align:middle line:84%
said there are very
ancient lineage of beings.

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what he showed you
of them, of their presence.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And he said they live in
the Moon-- not on the Moon,

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:51.790 align:middle line:90%
but in the Moon.

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:53.955 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
this order of beings.

00:29:53.955 --> 00:29:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, there are
different orders of beings.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.660 align:middle line:84%
His particular order of
beings feel a responsibility

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:02.620 align:middle line:84%
to intelligences from a higher
level, particularly associated,

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.902 align:middle line:84%
I would say, the
Sirius star system--

00:30:04.902 --> 00:30:05.860 align:middle line:90%
the sun behind the sun.

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:06.938 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:30:06.938 --> 00:30:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I'm getting shivers
as I say that to you.

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that makes sense.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I think, in a sense,
he regards himself and his

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:17.080 align:middle line:84%
particular group of daimons
of Luna as intermediaries,

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.617 align:middle line:90%
gatekeepers, assistants--

00:30:18.617 --> 00:30:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which they
would have to be.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: --drivers,
chauffeurs for beings

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.518 align:middle line:84%
who are operating from a
higher level and beings

00:30:25.518 --> 00:30:27.310 align:middle line:84%
who might be able to
ascend to those levels

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:29.715 align:middle line:84%
after doing certain things
in the realm of the Moon.

00:30:29.715 --> 00:30:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and this overlays
with the hermetics text

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:32.980 align:middle line:90%
on this, as well.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yeah.

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also, a man
named Walter Cruttenden--

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where it's landed
in the world of astrophysics.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.730 align:middle line:84%
But he had hypothesized
as an amateur astrologer

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:43.805 align:middle line:90%
at a very high level.

00:30:43.805 --> 00:30:46.180 align:middle line:84%
He holds conferences on this
and brings out the big guns,

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:50.380 align:middle line:84%
and that the sun was in a binary
star system, which I think

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:51.590 align:middle line:90%
is now accepted.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he was positing
that that binary star, if you

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:59.060 align:middle line:84%
go through the lens of the
ancient Egyptians, is Sirius.

00:30:59.060 --> 00:30:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the two
are companions stars.

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.810 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: I think that's correct.

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:05.780 align:middle line:90%
I think that's correct.

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I'm saying it
would make your story, really,

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:08.800 align:middle line:90%
very coherent.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.458 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a
coherent story, even

00:31:11.458 --> 00:31:15.370 align:middle line:84%
if it sounds a little bit creaky
and antiquated in the language.

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Because actually, in
some ways, these things

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:20.573 align:middle line:84%
were probably easier to
understand 5,000 years ago

00:31:20.573 --> 00:31:22.990 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt than they are today
because the channels were not

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:24.910 align:middle line:84%
so blurred, and
because the clouds

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:26.530 align:middle line:84%
of psychic pollution
around the planet

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:28.030 align:middle line:84%
were not as thick
as they've become.

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:31.278 align:middle line:84%
It's become harder for
us to attain or return

00:31:31.278 --> 00:31:33.070 align:middle line:84%
to direct knowledge of
some of these things

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:37.930 align:middle line:84%
because the psycho-spiritual
realm around the Earth

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:39.730 align:middle line:90%
is contaminated and confused.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and we are going
to get into that toward the end

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:45.880 align:middle line:84%
of our conversation, so stay
put everybody because we need

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.260 align:middle line:84%
to get into why so many of
us are not dreaming anymore--

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:49.060 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes, we do.

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.935 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is
going to be part of it.

00:31:50.935 --> 00:31:53.490 align:middle line:84%
But in the Egyptian day, these
were things were understood.

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:54.290 align:middle line:90%
They were honored.

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:55.300 align:middle line:90%
They were practiced.

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.280 align:middle line:84%
It was part of the
collective mindset.

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.530 align:middle line:84%
The apertures and
this sacred spaces

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:02.060 align:middle line:84%
were oriented towards
Sirius, and so forth.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:04.660 align:middle line:84%
So this was something that
was accepted and known

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:06.325 align:middle line:84%
in the day of levels
of high knowledge.

00:32:06.325 --> 00:32:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's go back
to your man, your daemon

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:14.800 align:middle line:84%
or diamon, and his
explanation of his people.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.470 align:middle line:90%
I like what you've said so far.

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:21.280 align:middle line:84%
So they're gatekeepers,
drivers, so to speak-- guides--

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.070 align:middle line:84%
that both assist
human beings that

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:28.390 align:middle line:84%
are transiting beyond the Earth
experience into other realms,

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:31.892 align:middle line:84%
but also in the
reincarnation process, then?

00:32:31.892 --> 00:32:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Yes, quite possibly,
and also in setting up

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.777 align:middle line:84%
temporary or indefinite
residence in the realm

00:32:38.777 --> 00:32:39.610 align:middle line:90%
of the Moon, itself.

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
intelligences, beings

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:46.210 align:middle line:84%
from this Earth who choose to
stay on that level of access

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:49.030 align:middle line:84%
and observation to the
Earth for various reasons,

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:50.270 align:middle line:90%
sometimes quite good reasons.

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.567 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: They would like to
keep an eye on the Earth,

00:32:52.567 --> 00:32:54.880 align:middle line:84%
intercede in the minds
of people on this Earth,

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.310 align:middle line:84%
and give them information
from their point of view.

00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And from the ramparts of
the astral realm of Luna,

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.470 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, they
might have access to us

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and be able to intercede
in effective ways.

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and he gave you
some very specific information

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.440 align:middle line:84%
speaking about the soul
path of individuals,

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:15.730 align:middle line:84%
that every person, every
being comes in with a path

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:17.550 align:middle line:90%
that they have chosen to walk.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet, he
was explaining to you,

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:23.890 align:middle line:84%
you can make that
choice before birth.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:25.390 align:middle line:90%
You can be given the--

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:28.810 align:middle line:84%
you can see the key dates
through your cosmic influences

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:30.640 align:middle line:84%
of astrology, and
so forth, where

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.600 align:middle line:84%
you get a green light or
a red light on something.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:37.330 align:middle line:84%
But that there are no
guarantees against what

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:39.670 align:middle line:90%
he called acts of god.

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And so explain
this a little bit.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, I think it's
certainly in my personal

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:48.730 align:middle line:84%
mythology, and maybe in his
guidebook to the cosmos--

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:51.640 align:middle line:84%
all of us to come here with
a soul agreement, some kind

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.640 align:middle line:84%
of basic set of
clauses and conditions

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.050 align:middle line:90%
we accepted before we came here.

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:58.473 align:middle line:84%
It might seem very strange to
us in the midst of our life

00:33:58.473 --> 00:33:59.890 align:middle line:84%
that we could
possibly have chosen

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:01.150 align:middle line:84%
certain things
that are happening

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:02.150 align:middle line:90%
or are going on around--

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:04.062 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I'm
with you on that.

00:34:04.062 --> 00:34:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: But everything
is subject to negotiation

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.889 align:middle line:84%
to a certain extent,
and things are also

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:10.659 align:middle line:90%
subject to interruption.

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:13.510 align:middle line:84%
There are things that can
cut a life purpose short,

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:16.840 align:middle line:84%
that can cut a destiny short,
that can cut a lifeline short.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.219 align:middle line:84%
There are interceptions
and interruptions,

00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:21.080 align:middle line:90%
so it's not predestined.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There are accidents.

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: There are
accidents, yes.

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:25.833 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so he
talked about that.

00:34:25.833 --> 00:34:30.239 align:middle line:84%
He also talked about what
happens with the soul who

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:33.780 align:middle line:84%
has almost become
like a criminal mind,

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:35.820 align:middle line:84%
and who has slowed
their own progress down,

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.469 align:middle line:90%
or they've become degraded.

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Because we're talking about
how through many different

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:45.570 align:middle line:84%
traditions in this in-between
place, life is looked over,

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:49.560 align:middle line:84%
it's analyzed, it's decided how
to proceed into the next one.

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:54.420 align:middle line:84%
But as he was telling you,
as a soul becomes degraded,

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:55.949 align:middle line:90%
those choices are not the same.

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:57.130 align:middle line:90%
They're greatly narrowed.

00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Right.

00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain
what he meant by that.

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.590 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Right.

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, we are
surrounded by people

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:05.550 align:middle line:90%
who are soul-gone, actually.

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:07.380 align:middle line:84%
This is at the root of
many of our problems

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.360 align:middle line:84%
socially, politically,
et cetera.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.190 align:middle line:84%
But we are surrounded
by people, including

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:13.380 align:middle line:84%
people in places
of power, who don't

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:17.370 align:middle line:84%
have inside their being anymore
the higher intelligence, higher

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:18.810 align:middle line:90%
purpose, sense of conscience--

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:19.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So it would seem.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: --that makes us human.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.110 align:middle line:90%
So it would seem.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:23.940 align:middle line:84%
So what happens to
these people in the end?

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:25.740 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a
story that I'm not

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:28.200 align:middle line:90%
competent to answer directly.

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one would like
to think sometimes

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:34.320 align:middle line:84%
that these degraded
intellects, these degraded soul

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:38.770 align:middle line:84%
combinations can somehow
be dissolved and vanished.

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:41.670 align:middle line:84%
But we live in a world of
competing powers and the cosmos

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:43.740 align:middle line:84%
of competing powers,
competing intelligences,

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:44.675 align:middle line:90%
competing agendas.

00:35:44.675 --> 00:35:46.300 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know it's
as simple as that.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:48.570 align:middle line:84%
What I do know, and here, I
want to go back to the dreaming.

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:48.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Can we do
that for a moment?

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: What I do
know as a dreamer is

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:55.140 align:middle line:84%
that one of the ways for all
of us, in any circumstance,

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.570 align:middle line:84%
to get back in touch
with soul, to get back

00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:59.550 align:middle line:84%
in touch with purpose,
to get back in touch

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:03.110 align:middle line:84%
with meaning and conscience
is to recover our dreams.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
frightening things to me

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:06.790 align:middle line:84%
about the state of
our society, the theme

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:08.790 align:middle line:84%
of some of the stories
and mysterious realities,

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:11.040 align:middle line:84%
actually, is that
so many of us today

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.330 align:middle line:90%
are suffering a dream drought.

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:14.868 align:middle line:84%
We are, in fact, bereft of
the dreams of the night.

00:36:14.868 --> 00:36:16.410 align:middle line:84%
We might have all
sorts of practices.

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:19.530 align:middle line:84%
We might do yoga, or Kung Fu,
or meditation, or whatever.

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:22.620 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have the natural,
ongoing nightly relationship

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.660 align:middle line:84%
with dreams that most
traditional cultures

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:25.800 align:middle line:90%
have prized and valued.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.760 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Because dreams
show us how we are.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:31.662 align:middle line:84%
They hold up a magic mirror
to our actions and attitudes,

00:36:31.662 --> 00:36:33.120 align:middle line:84%
and because they
show us the future

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.912 align:middle line:84%
and they show us our
connection with beings

00:36:34.912 --> 00:36:36.090 align:middle line:90%
in other times and places.

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And they put us in touch with
a wiser source of knowledge

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:40.180 align:middle line:90%
than the ordinary mind.

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:41.940 align:middle line:84%
So if we've lost
our dreams, we might

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:44.400 align:middle line:84%
have lost the voice of
conscience, the voice of soul,

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.095 align:middle line:90%
the voice of deeper wisdom.

00:36:46.095 --> 00:36:47.800 align:middle line:90%
And what can we do about that?

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is a
shamanic answer to this,

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:53.940 align:middle line:84%
which I want to really speak
on this very important occasion

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.070 align:middle line:90%
with you, Regina.

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:58.020 align:middle line:84%
The shamanic answer is if you've
lost your dreams, consider

00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:59.790 align:middle line:84%
the fact that you
might have lost

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:01.342 align:middle line:84%
the beautiful bright
dreamer in you,

00:37:01.342 --> 00:37:03.300 align:middle line:84%
and you might have lost
at some point in life--

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:04.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Soul-fragmentation.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.162 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Soul-fragmentation,
soul-loss-- soul-loss

00:37:06.162 --> 00:37:09.180 align:middle line:84%
would be the shamans'
essential diagnosis.

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:10.480 align:middle line:90%
And how could that happen?

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:13.148 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe, you
remember, even if vaguely,

00:37:13.148 --> 00:37:14.940 align:middle line:84%
a moment in your life
when the world seemed

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:17.730 align:middle line:84%
so cold and so cruel you
didn't want to be here.

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:19.125 align:middle line:90%
You wanted to be somewhere else.

00:37:19.125 --> 00:37:21.000 align:middle line:84%
You wanted to be in a
garden behind the Moon.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.417 align:middle line:84%
You want to be in
grandma's house.

00:37:22.417 --> 00:37:24.180 align:middle line:84%
You wanted to be
anywhere but here.

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.880 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you wished yourself dead.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.300 align:middle line:84%
It could have
happened at any age.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:28.500 align:middle line:84%
It could have
happened very young.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.833 align:middle line:84%
It could have happened to the
beautiful, bright teenager

00:37:30.833 --> 00:37:32.820 align:middle line:84%
who's shamed or
violated in some way.

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Part of you wanted
to go away and wanted

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:38.320 align:middle line:84%
so hard to go away that she
did go away, is not with you--

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.210 align:middle line:90%
soul loss, in shamanic terms.

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:41.010 align:middle line:90%
And who is she?

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:41.820 align:middle line:90%
Who is this person?

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:42.903 align:middle line:90%
This might be the dreamer.

00:37:42.903 --> 00:37:45.100 align:middle line:84%
This might be the one who
never lost her dreams.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:47.500 align:middle line:84%
But when you lost her,
you lost your dreams.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.010 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying is
that maybe the antidote

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.020 align:middle line:84%
to the loss of dreams and
the loss of connection

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.870 align:middle line:84%
with conscience and deeper
wisdom that that brings

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:57.150 align:middle line:84%
is for us to find
ways to call back

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:58.440 align:middle line:90%
the beautiful, bright dreamer.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.910 align:middle line:84%
The magical child may
be in each of our lives.

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:02.822 align:middle line:84%
This is what interests
me profoundly.

00:38:02.822 --> 00:38:04.530 align:middle line:84%
This is actually at
the center of my work

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:07.830 align:middle line:84%
as a teacher and healer at
this time-- helping people

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:10.500 align:middle line:84%
to connect again to
the inner child, maybe

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.870 align:middle line:84%
the magical child who is the
beautiful, bright dreamer.

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Because when she comes home,
when you can get her home,

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.930 align:middle line:84%
persuade her that you
are safe and you are fun,

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:19.750 align:middle line:90%
your dreams come back.

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and this is
something I wanted to find

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:23.500 align:middle line:90%
out--

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:25.060 align:middle line:84%
you've been doing
this a long time.

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you
seeing a difference,

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:33.030 align:middle line:84%
quantitatively or qualitatively,
in people's dreams,

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:34.920 align:middle line:84%
in conferences and
workshops you do now

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:37.200 align:middle line:90%
versus 10, 20, 30 years ago?

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I see and feel
a hunger for this,

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:44.700 align:middle line:84%
which is a much livelier hunger,
much more eager and voracious

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.220 align:middle line:84%
hunger than I remember
20 or 25 years ago.

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.562 align:middle line:84%
I think more people are aware
that something is missing

00:38:49.562 --> 00:38:50.770 align:middle line:90%
and they want to get it back.

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:52.890 align:middle line:90%
And I also see in my own work--

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:55.440 align:middle line:84%
in the workshops, online
courses, and so on that I do--

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.960 align:middle line:90%
I see an immediacy of results.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.990 align:middle line:84%
If I say to someone, OK,
you don't have your dreams,

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:03.510 align:middle line:84%
can we help you
call up the memory

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:05.310 align:middle line:84%
of that occasion
from your childhood,

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:07.800 align:middle line:84%
or better still, a dream
from your childhood self?

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And can we use that maybe
as a time tunnel for you

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.360 align:middle line:84%
to go back to your
childhood self

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.930 align:middle line:84%
and play counselor,
protector, cheerleader for her

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:16.260 align:middle line:90%
in her own time?

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And maybe in the process,
bring something of her back

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.370 align:middle line:90%
to your present self?

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And someone might say,
well, I'd like to try,

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:23.910 align:middle line:90%
but how do I do that safely?

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:26.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, I might then say to
them-- because I'm a shamanic

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:27.410 align:middle line:90%
dreamer--

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I might say, OK, why don't
we connect you with an ally?

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Why do we connect with
Great Mother Bear who's

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:35.450 align:middle line:84%
going to come with you and
put her immense potency,

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and her love and
protection and blessing

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:39.910 align:middle line:84%
all around you, so when you
meet your childhood self,

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:40.710 align:middle line:90%
it's not alone.

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:43.640 align:middle line:84%
You have Great Mother
Bear holding you together.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.580 align:middle line:84%
The results from this
kind of approach,

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:46.943 align:middle line:90%
Regina, are astonishing.

00:39:46.943 --> 00:39:48.110 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they're astonishing.

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:48.455 align:middle line:90%
How--

00:39:48.455 --> 00:39:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it's a
matter of calling back.

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Yes, it's a
matter of calling--

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:52.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can consciously
call back a part of you.

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: --something
that belongs to you.

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:54.410 align:middle line:90%
It belongs to you.

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And also, because, we're also
talking about our relationship

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.412 align:middle line:90%
with time, here.

00:39:58.412 --> 00:39:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
let's get into that.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I mean, this is
trans-temporal stuff,

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.340 align:middle line:84%
and some of my stories are
about trans-temporal stuff.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.800 align:middle line:84%
The fact that from
this moment of now,

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.350 align:middle line:84%
we might have the capacity
to travel into the past

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:12.080 align:middle line:84%
and be present at least
in the mind of someone

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.240 align:middle line:84%
living in the past, whether
it's a younger self,

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.640 align:middle line:84%
or a person in a past life,
or an ancestral being.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We might not only be able to go
there and have a look around.

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:21.680 align:middle line:84%
We might be able to
communicate at least mentally

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.570 align:middle line:84%
with that person
in their own time.

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:24.863 align:middle line:90%
I believe this to be so.

00:40:24.863 --> 00:40:26.780 align:middle line:84%
I think it's actually
one of the things that's

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.840 align:middle line:84%
kept my life together to the
extent it's stayed together.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.940 align:middle line:84%
So we can travel
into parallel lives.

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:34.010 align:middle line:84%
We can look at that
Regina or that Robert who

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:36.500 align:middle line:84%
made a different choice
and talk to them,

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:37.922 align:middle line:90%
maybe, negotiate with them.

00:40:37.922 --> 00:40:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Can we do something
for each other?

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:40.480 align:middle line:90%
You did this so well.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.480 align:middle line:90%
I haven't done that yet.

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.380 align:middle line:90%
Can you help me out?

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:44.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, I could offer
you something in return.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.370 align:middle line:90%
We might be able to try that.

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:48.470 align:middle line:84%
So but with the
younger self, to be

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.840 align:middle line:84%
able to go back to your
younger self using a dream

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:54.860 align:middle line:84%
or memory for a time tunnel, be
counselor, protective, mentor

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.020 align:middle line:84%
for her in her own time,
and bring her energy

00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and imagination, that's
a really delicious idea.

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:00.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And on that, I think
this is a good time

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:05.510 align:middle line:84%
to segue into you in
the parallel you, who

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:07.950 align:middle line:84%
wrote this amazing book
called "Blue World."

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:08.750 align:middle line:90%
The parallel you--

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You didn't know
the difference in the moment.

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:15.110 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about it because
I think it's fascinating,

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:17.430 align:middle line:84%
and it ties in with
what you just said.

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:19.730 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, I'm aware that
amongst my many parallel

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Roberts, there
are writers who've

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:24.160 align:middle line:84%
done things I have not done
as a writer in my reality.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most interesting
of these parallel Robert

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:31.060 align:middle line:84%
writers is the one who
completed a book called

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.570 align:middle line:84%
"The Blue World,"
which was going

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:34.820 align:middle line:84%
to be a bit of sort of Harry
Potter of the dream world

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.410 align:middle line:90%
kind of stuff, and more.

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And I embarked upon
it many years ago,

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.950 align:middle line:90%
and I had other things to do.

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:40.890 align:middle line:90%
I interrupted myself.

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:41.690 align:middle line:90%
I came at it again.

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:42.840 align:middle line:90%
I left it again.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.250 align:middle line:90%
He finished it.

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:45.448 align:middle line:90%
He's been very successful.

00:41:45.448 --> 00:41:46.490 align:middle line:90%
He's done a couple since.

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:47.150 align:middle line:90%
They're a whole series.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.950 align:middle line:90%
There are movies.

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:49.680 align:middle line:90%
He is a beloved storyteller.

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's drop into
your cocktail party with him.

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:53.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:54.410 align:middle line:90%


00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: So I find myself at
The New York Public Library,

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.490 align:middle line:90%
and it's a big event.

00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:59.290 align:middle line:90%
It's all for me.

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:00.300 align:middle line:90%
It's over Robert Moss.

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:01.163 align:middle line:90%
There's my name.

00:42:01.163 --> 00:42:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And there are these book jackets
I don't quite recognize--

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Posters.

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:05.992 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Posters, yes,
including "The Blue World."

00:42:05.992 --> 00:42:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's waiters
with champagne.

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.835 align:middle line:84%
I try to get a drink and nobody
pays any attention to me,

00:42:09.835 --> 00:42:11.880 align:middle line:90%
as if I'm a ghost.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And I go into the-- there's
an auditorium there.

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:14.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether
the New York Public

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Library has an auditorium
quite like this,

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:20.045 align:middle line:84%
but it's full of families with
piles of Robert Moss' books.

00:42:20.045 --> 00:42:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's the microphone,
and I think, oh, great,

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:23.510 align:middle line:90%
so I'll get up on stage.

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:24.810 align:middle line:90%
Then I see a parallel Robert.

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:26.060 align:middle line:90%
He's better dressed than I am.

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.250 align:middle line:90%
His hair is better kempt.

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He had nice
shoes on, I recall.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Very nice shoes,
very nice Oxford brogues,

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:34.580 align:middle line:84%
or something like that, instead
of my scuffed walking shoes.

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:35.690 align:middle line:90%
He looks really good.

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:36.590 align:middle line:90%
He's lightly tanned.

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:37.250 align:middle line:90%
He looks quite--

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You said his skin
looked really-- almost--

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:40.160 align:middle line:90%
yeah, lightly tanned, beautiful.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: He is slightly--
he's beautiful.

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:43.670 align:middle line:90%
He's beautiful.

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think, OK, well, OK, maybe
this is my dream self, right?

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.840 align:middle line:84%
I can jump in to his
situation, give this talk.

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're talking about all
his best-selling positions

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:55.030 align:middle line:90%
and his sales.

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:56.030 align:middle line:90%
It's all good.

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And I try to get
into his situation.

00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:59.660 align:middle line:90%
He says, get the F out of here.

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:00.650 align:middle line:90%
I wrote these books.

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:01.250 align:middle line:90%
You didn't.

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:02.050 align:middle line:90%
Go away.

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:03.130 align:middle line:90%
Don't bother me.

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:05.960 align:middle line:84%
By God, I've just met
my parallel self who's

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.120 align:middle line:84%
done something great
that I haven't done,

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.260 align:middle line:90%
and he's not letting me in.

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.622 align:middle line:84%
And I come out of this and
I start laughing at myself.

00:43:11.622 --> 00:43:12.830 align:middle line:90%
I think you know, he's right.

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:15.470 align:middle line:84%
I would've played it the
same way in his situation.

00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:17.990 align:middle line:84%
But since then, since the
story, Regina, I've gone

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:20.630 align:middle line:84%
and I've had lunch with him and
in a dream-like, non-ordinary

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:21.680 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.620 align:middle line:84%
We've made a sort of tentative
deal to help each other out.

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:27.720 align:middle line:84%
But I have yet to sort of take
the actions that requires,

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:31.458 align:middle line:84%
so I can't report on
the results just yet.

00:43:31.458 --> 00:43:33.500 align:middle line:84%
But what does this mean
to anybody else watching?

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:34.880 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it means this--

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.280 align:middle line:84%
maybe if you discover you
have a parallel self who

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.410 align:middle line:84%
did some interesting
things you haven't done,

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:41.330 align:middle line:84%
maybe you could
actually investigate

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:43.362 align:middle line:84%
bringing some those gifts,
some of that access,

00:43:43.362 --> 00:43:45.320 align:middle line:84%
some of those connections,
some of those skills

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.278 align:middle line:90%
into your present life.

00:43:46.278 --> 00:43:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you could-- why
not give it a try?

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:49.295 align:middle line:90%
What's to be lost?

00:43:49.295 --> 00:43:51.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you're
giving me some ideas here.

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:54.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, usually it's things
we've thought of and thought,

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:56.060 align:middle line:90%
ah, I probably couldn't do that.

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:59.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't have time or I wouldn't
get the support I needed,

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:01.100 align:middle line:84%
so we kind of let
those dreams go.

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.578 align:middle line:84%
So you're basically
saying, pick up

00:44:02.578 --> 00:44:04.370 align:middle line:84%
on the thread of those
dreams, those things

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:05.540 align:middle line:90%
that really lit our jets--

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and see
where that takes us.

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:07.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.315 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because that
would bring back alive

00:44:09.315 --> 00:44:11.720 align:middle line:84%
again that version
of us that originally

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.310 align:middle line:84%
had those dreams and those
intensely warm feelings.

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:15.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Well said.

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we can't catch up
to all that parallel self has

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:20.540 align:middle line:84%
done, having devoted all these
years to something that we

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:20.780 align:middle line:90%
didn't--

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He's down the
road on "Blue Road."

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yeah.

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "The Blue World."

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: But we can
bring something.

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:25.610 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I have an artist Rob.

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:27.710 align:middle line:84%
I loved art when I was
a kid, painted a lot.

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.360 align:middle line:84%
There's a parallel
Robert, the painter,

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:31.880 align:middle line:84%
who has skills I will
never develop in this life.

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.360 align:middle line:84%
I can say that
for certain, sure.

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.110 align:middle line:84%
But when I think of him, I do a
lot more drawing and coloring,

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:37.760 align:middle line:90%
watercolor pencils, et cetera.

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.650 align:middle line:90%
So my own art has come alive.

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:42.230 align:middle line:84%
I'll never paint in oils,
probably, the way that he does,

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:44.000 align:middle line:84%
but just a sense of
connection with him

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.862 align:middle line:84%
makes me feel happy,
makes me feel cheerful,

00:44:45.862 --> 00:44:48.070 align:middle line:84%
makes me want to pick up
the colors and do something.

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.628 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to do
"Blue World," or not?

00:44:50.628 --> 00:44:52.310 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like a
fascinating book.

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I have a project for
this winter when I'll actually

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.500 align:middle line:84%
be at home for six
weeks, off the road.

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:58.315 align:middle line:90%
We'll see.

00:44:58.315 --> 00:44:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, well, we'll see.

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe he'll let
you have a cocktail with him

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:02.050 align:middle line:90%
down the road.

00:45:02.050 --> 00:45:02.473 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:45:02.473 --> 00:45:03.319 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: [LAUGHS]

00:45:03.319 --> 00:45:04.590 align:middle line:90%


00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:07.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this notion,
though, now going back

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.620 align:middle line:84%
to-- because I think
we can inter-splice

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:13.640 align:middle line:84%
some of the comments from the
daimon entity throughout this.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Because he's also explaining to
you that the nature of living

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:18.690 align:middle line:84%
in this particular--
this reality,

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:21.620 align:middle line:84%
this third/fourth-dimensional
human realm is--

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:26.860 align:middle line:84%
he called it a relentless
forward moving of time,

00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:28.920 align:middle line:84%
and that sounds very
harsh and limiting to me.

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Mm-hmm.

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.527 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What did
he mean by that?

00:45:31.527 --> 00:45:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, I can't speak
for him at this moment

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:35.662 align:middle line:84%
because he's not in
my mind right now.

00:45:35.662 --> 00:45:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And as you use some
of the phrases,

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.520 align:middle line:84%
I have to grope around,
remember exactly what

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.780 align:middle line:90%
I was reporting at that time.

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: That is not
actually my opinion.

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:45.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I'm talking
to an entity who

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.440 align:middle line:84%
I think is more than
an aspect of myself.

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.745 align:middle line:84%
I think he is a trans-personal
entity who has his own views.

00:45:50.745 --> 00:45:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And his views are
not necessarily

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:53.990 align:middle line:90%
to be taken as 100% correct.

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:55.795 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I'm getting
myself into--

00:45:55.795 --> 00:45:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: These are just his--

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I'm getting myself
into trouble again, now.

00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.390 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:59.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:01.088 align:middle line:90%


00:46:01.088 --> 00:46:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I think that time
is much more malleable,

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:04.630 align:middle line:90%
much more flexible than that--

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
what it sounds like.

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:07.285 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: --fragment
would suggest.

00:46:07.285 --> 00:46:09.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and that's
why I underscored it

00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:12.672 align:middle line:84%
because this is not in
alignment with your experience

00:46:12.672 --> 00:46:13.630 align:middle line:90%
and what you're saying.

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:15.558 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
let that one go.

00:46:15.558 --> 00:46:17.350 align:middle line:84%
The only other one I
wanted to bring up out

00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:20.320 align:middle line:84%
of that whole
chapter was something

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:21.250 align:middle line:90%
you made a comment on.

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm only bringing
it up for this reason--

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:26.110 align:middle line:84%
people seem to be in
despair, and a lot

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:28.390 align:middle line:84%
of people, a huge percentage
of the world's population

00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:31.180 align:middle line:84%
are in despair and under
pressure and exhausted.

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:34.535 align:middle line:84%
And one thing he did mention to
you is the notion of suicide,

00:46:34.535 --> 00:46:36.160 align:middle line:84%
saying when you have
a social contract,

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.750 align:middle line:84%
you're here to
live that contract,

00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:42.220 align:middle line:84%
and suicide is not really the
best option for you as a soul,

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:44.230 align:middle line:90%
on a soul level.

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember much about
that part of it and why?

00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, I mean, ending
your life at a certain point,

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:53.575 align:middle line:84%
whether it's
suicide or through--

00:46:53.575 --> 00:46:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Negligence.

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: --illness or negligence,
or such might, in a sense,

00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.160 align:middle line:84%
be part of the
circumstances you agreed to.

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:00.618 align:middle line:84%
It might be in your
soul agreement.

00:47:00.618 --> 00:47:03.243 align:middle line:84%
And there are things that amount
to slow suicide, aren't there?

00:47:03.243 --> 00:47:04.290 align:middle line:90%
I mean, things that--

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:06.630 align:middle line:84%
habits that we take
up which are not

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:08.670 align:middle line:84%
the action of shooting
yourself with a gun

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:10.740 align:middle line:84%
or jumping off a cliff,
but in a sense you know

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:12.570 align:middle line:84%
are going to take you out
sooner than you might.

00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:13.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:15.360 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I think it's
always foolish in life

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.790 align:middle line:84%
to think that you can
get out of a situation

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:20.160 align:middle line:84%
by jumping out of
this body in this life

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.220 align:middle line:84%
and going somewhere else,
whether it's just a black hole,

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:25.222 align:middle line:84%
or it's a place of
respite and sanctuary.

00:47:25.222 --> 00:47:26.430 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's like that.

00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:28.680 align:middle line:84%
I think whatever you're
living in this life will

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:30.000 align:middle line:90%
continue to have consequences.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And your story does
not end with death,

00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:34.890 align:middle line:84%
whether the death is by
suicide or in some other way.

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
many people who take

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:38.910 align:middle line:84%
themselves out early
through suicide then

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:41.430 align:middle line:84%
have to go through the process
of awakening to the fact

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:44.580 align:middle line:84%
that this didn't end,
does not end the situation

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:45.720 align:middle line:90%
you are trying to escape.

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:48.570 align:middle line:84%
Having said that, I have
great sympathy for people

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:50.730 align:middle line:84%
who feel they have the
right to take themselves out

00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:52.305 align:middle line:84%
because they're suffering
incredible pain--

00:47:52.305 --> 00:47:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I do, too.

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:53.865 align:middle line:90%
And who wants that?

00:47:53.865 --> 00:47:55.782 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: --incredible
deterioration, or perhaps

00:47:55.782 --> 00:47:57.390 align:middle line:84%
for noble reasons,
for the protection

00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:59.880 align:middle line:84%
of a cause or a family, or
something like in wartime,

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.000 align:middle line:90%
something like that.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.130 align:middle line:90%
So there is a case.

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:04.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a case for
justifiable suicide.

00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:07.590 align:middle line:84%
I would not say that suicide is
wrong under all circumstances.

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:09.450 align:middle line:84%
But my mind goes
to the situation

00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:11.370 align:middle line:84%
of people who take
themselves out

00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:14.683 align:middle line:84%
because they find the world
too tough, too harsh, too

00:48:14.683 --> 00:48:17.100 align:middle line:84%
unsatisfactory, and think that
they're ending the problem.

00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:18.060 align:middle line:90%
You're not ending the problem.

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:18.977 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, yeah.

00:48:18.977 --> 00:48:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I've had no theology
about all of this, Regina.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:24.900 align:middle line:84%
But I do know as a dreamer,
as a lifelong active dreamer,

00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:26.770 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness
survives physical death.

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:27.570 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:28.740 align:middle line:90%
I've known that all my life.

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.782 align:middle line:84%
And I know that it's a
boy who died and came back

00:48:30.782 --> 00:48:33.510 align:middle line:84%
through what we now call
near-death experiences, also.

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:35.850 align:middle line:84%
So I know that whatever
the consequences of what

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:38.200 align:middle line:84%
we did or failed to do in
this life, they continue.

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:39.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: The waves go on.

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: So--

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you can draw
within yourself the power

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:48.000 align:middle line:84%
to be able to balance
it while you're

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.452 align:middle line:90%
embodied, all the better.

00:48:49.452 --> 00:48:50.910 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
carry it forward.

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: I've found that it's
terribly necessary for those

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:56.610 align:middle line:84%
of us who've lost someone in our
ambit, in our friends or family

00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:59.820 align:middle line:84%
to suicide to recognize that
part of our responsibility

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:02.013 align:middle line:84%
now is probably going to
be to offer forgiveness.

00:49:02.013 --> 00:49:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Because often, they're
now seeking forgiveness

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:06.480 align:middle line:84%
for the pain that they
caused and for the task left

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:09.930 align:middle line:84%
unaccomplished, and to call in
guidance and blessing for them

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:10.770 align:middle line:90%
in their new path.

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes they,
having killed themselves,

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:16.050 align:middle line:84%
might go into the
strange enormity

00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:18.173 align:middle line:84%
of trying to call someone
to them from this life

00:49:18.173 --> 00:49:19.590 align:middle line:84%
in their loneliness,
and might try

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:22.260 align:middle line:84%
to draw someone else into
a kind of suicide pact.

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:23.220 align:middle line:90%
That happens so often.

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:24.340 align:middle line:90%
You see it amongst kids.

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:26.120 align:middle line:84%
You also see it amongst
adults, as well.

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:28.663 align:middle line:90%
So we've got to be wary of that.

00:49:28.663 --> 00:49:31.080 align:middle line:84%
We've also got to be wary of
people who condemn themselves

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:33.330 align:middle line:84%
to some kind of damnation
in thinking that they've

00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:35.220 align:middle line:90%
committed a terrible sin now.

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:39.120 align:middle line:84%
So our role is going to
be to be helpers, assist

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.670 align:middle line:84%
the imaginations of the dead,
as Yeats said we could do,

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:42.870 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And call in God's blessing
and protection for everyone

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:47.040 align:middle line:84%
involved, and remember
that forgiveness

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.240 align:middle line:90%
is the great healer.

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautifully said.

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.110 align:middle line:84%
We only have time for a
couple more "stories,"

00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:54.060 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
give you a choice.

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:57.733 align:middle line:84%
But one of them I thought
was interesting was--

00:49:57.733 --> 00:50:00.150 align:middle line:84%
oh, you, here, were talking
about happy hour for the dead,

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:02.310 align:middle line:90%
but we'll get there later.

00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:04.840 align:middle line:84%
I thought we'd do a
quick stop with Carl

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Jung and his other world, the
other world of Bollingen. How

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:09.620 align:middle line:90%
do you say it?

00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:09.790 align:middle line:90%
"Bowl-engin"?

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: "Ball-in-gen."

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "Ball-in-gen."

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: "Ball-in-gen.
Ball-in-gen."

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "Ball-in-gen."

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: If we're
going to be Germanic.

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no please.

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:13.730 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: It's a German name.

00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I didn't
know how to say it.

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: "Ball-in-gen."

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:16.020 align:middle line:90%
No, no, I mean--

00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:17.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: "Ball-in-gen."

00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: They say
"Ball-in-gen" in Switzerland.

00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, it's a story
about a couple of encounters

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.440 align:middle line:84%
that I had with Jung
in the imaginal space.

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Let me note that when
I talk about dreaming,

00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:29.117 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just talking
about sleep dreams.

00:50:29.117 --> 00:50:30.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just talking
about lucid dreams.

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:32.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even just talking
about shamanic journeys

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:33.620 align:middle line:90%
or meditation.

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:36.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about our ability
to enter a liminal state

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:37.530 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:39.300 align:middle line:84%
A lot of my best
dreaming is done

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:42.025 align:middle line:84%
in the space between sleep and
awake, the hypnagogic zone.

00:50:42.025 --> 00:50:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:45.483 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: And I just want to quote
a great source on all of this

00:50:45.483 --> 00:50:47.910 align:middle line:84%
to our viewers, which is
Tinkerbell from the Hollywood

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:49.590 align:middle line:90%
movie "Peter Pan."

00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Tinkerbell said to
Peter when Peter's sad

00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:54.030 align:middle line:84%
because he is about to
lose his fairy friend--

00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:56.740 align:middle line:84%
she said, look for me in the
place between sleep and awake.

00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:59.082 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: There I will
always love you.

00:50:59.082 --> 00:51:00.150 align:middle line:90%
There you will find me.

00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:01.740 align:middle line:90%
This is great technical advice--

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.913 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: --the place
between sleep and awake.

00:51:03.913 --> 00:51:05.400 align:middle line:84%
So I want to notice,
for those who

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:08.340 align:middle line:84%
would like to get deeper into
a practice out of all this,

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:11.220 align:middle line:84%
that spending more time in the
twilight state between sleep

00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:13.410 align:middle line:84%
and awake is a great way
to become a lucid dreamer.

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:17.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a great way to tap into
trans-personal and inner

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.898 align:middle line:84%
sources of information
and guidance

00:51:18.898 --> 00:51:20.190 align:middle line:90%
that might be available to you.

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:20.980 align:middle line:90%
We are creative.

00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:21.780 align:middle line:90%
We're psychic.

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:24.680 align:middle line:84%
We put things together in a
creative way much more easily.

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:26.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's where a lot of
these things come from.

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So my story of young
is a story of a couple

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:29.960 align:middle line:90%
of encounters with him.

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:33.315 align:middle line:84%
But they are connected to
what we know about his life

00:51:33.315 --> 00:51:34.690 align:middle line:84%
from those who
were close to him.

00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:37.020 align:middle line:84%
We know that in the
last years of his life,

00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Jung dreamed again
and again of what

00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:40.170 align:middle line:90%
he called the other Bollingen.

00:51:40.170 --> 00:51:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Now Bollingen with his
name for his retreat

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:45.270 align:middle line:84%
on Lake Zurich near the
small village of Bollingen,

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:46.800 align:middle line:90%
where he built a tower.

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And he did amazing
murals and mosaics,

00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:54.320 align:middle line:84%
and carved a huge cube of
stone with mystical devices,

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.590 align:middle line:84%
and put above the
doorway, invoked

00:51:56.590 --> 00:51:59.360 align:middle line:84%
or uninvoked the god is
present, and did all this stuff,

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:01.550 align:middle line:84%
and worked with his
hands like a craftsman,

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:04.880 align:middle line:84%
made himself big meaty
Swiss German peasant stews

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.287 align:middle line:84%
because Jung was a man of
the earth and the people.

00:52:07.287 --> 00:52:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, but before
he died, he started

00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:10.578 align:middle line:84%
dreaming of another
version of this thing

00:52:10.578 --> 00:52:11.990 align:middle line:90%
on the other side of death.

00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And he said that these dreams
gave him absolute confidence

00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:16.700 align:middle line:84%
that he knew where
to go when he died.

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think in the
last of these dreams,

00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:21.290 align:middle line:84%
he saw some kind of water
animal, a mother animal.

00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:23.840 align:middle line:84%
I've forgotten what it was--
beaver or muskrat, something

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:26.752 align:middle line:84%
like that, a
wolverine, perhaps--

00:52:26.752 --> 00:52:28.960 align:middle line:84%
with her children in the
water, playing in the water.

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.560 align:middle line:84%
This made him very
happy again, felt

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:32.503 align:middle line:84%
confidence he knew
where he was going.

00:52:32.503 --> 00:52:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had a
couple of encounters

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:34.830 align:middle line:90%
with my version of Jung.

00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:36.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
be grandiose enough

00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:39.260 align:middle line:84%
to say this is Jung the spirit,
or this is the essence of Jung.

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Let's say the Jung that I
love and respect gives me

00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:44.900 align:middle line:84%
a partial tour of
the other Bollingen.

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:46.620 align:middle line:84%
He won't show me more
than a few things.

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:48.742 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a
protected environment.

00:52:48.742 --> 00:52:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And if it is the place
where he's living,

00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:52.492 align:middle line:84%
he's not going to show me
more than a few things.

00:52:52.492 --> 00:52:54.890 align:middle line:84%
But the hilarious part,
the really comedic part

00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:57.890 align:middle line:84%
in the story is he gives me a
glimpse of the book that he's

00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:59.210 align:middle line:90%
been writing on the other side.

00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:00.800 align:middle line:90%
We know about "The Red Book."

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.690 align:middle line:84%
This is The Purple
Book, and it's

00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:03.980 align:middle line:90%
called "The Book of Heaven."

00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:05.918 align:middle line:84%
The title in Latin means
"The Book of Heaven."

00:53:05.918 --> 00:53:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And he'll only show me--
he'll show me hardly anything.

00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:10.190 align:middle line:84%
He shows me the title
of the introduction.

00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:13.500 align:middle line:84%
The title of the introduction
is "Why I Am Not a Jungian."

00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS]

00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:16.580 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: So I think some
of my Jungian friends

00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:18.850 align:middle line:84%
are probably furious with
this, and some are-- perhaps

00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:20.647 align:middle line:84%
some are laughing up
their sleeves over it.

00:53:20.647 --> 00:53:21.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: So it's a somewhat
comedic version of what

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:25.670 align:middle line:90%
Jung's afterlife might be like.

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:29.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also, as you wrote
about it in this experience you

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.193 align:middle line:90%
had, his other "Balling-gun?"

00:53:31.193 --> 00:53:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: "Ball-in-gen."

00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: "Balling-gen"
was much more colorful.

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.560 align:middle line:84%
The colors didn't
exist in this realm.

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.200 align:middle line:84%
So it was everything,
but kind of

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:42.560 align:middle line:84%
supercharged in terms of
light and sound and frequency.

00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:44.990 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Yes, it's fantastic
what has been done there

00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:46.130 align:middle line:90%
with the mosaics.

00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:49.070 align:middle line:84%
There are mosaics going
up inside the tower, which

00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:51.630 align:middle line:84%
are like an incredibly
flourishing tree of life--

00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:53.270 align:middle line:84%
not just the Kabbalistic
tree of life,

00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:56.330 align:middle line:84%
but a tree rich in all the
colors of nature and colors

00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:58.050 align:middle line:90%
beyond the natural world.

00:53:58.050 --> 00:53:59.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's a beautiful
thing to see.

00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful.

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And because you brought up this
notion of the liminal state

00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:08.300 align:middle line:84%
between dreaming
and wakefulness,

00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:09.650 align:middle line:90%
this is something--

00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:11.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm bringing it up
because recently, I

00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:15.110 align:middle line:84%
realized my husband
was talking to me when

00:54:15.110 --> 00:54:16.970 align:middle line:84%
I was in the in-between
place, and it

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:18.620 align:middle line:90%
was very confusing for him.

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Because I notice-- and I'm
bringing this up because it has

00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:24.560 align:middle line:84%
to be many people have this
experience, yourself included--

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:27.370 align:middle line:84%
you close your eyes
and you're not asleep,

00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:30.770 align:middle line:84%
but immediately, you're
in another world.

00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:33.510 align:middle line:84%
There are players that
are involved with you.

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:36.603 align:middle line:84%
You're carrying on
conversations very quickly,

00:54:36.603 --> 00:54:38.270 align:middle line:84%
and you can't really
tell the difference

00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:42.350 align:middle line:84%
between the time and seconds
ago when you were awake.

00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be having
conversations.

00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And he'll enter
in from his world

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and ends up in my conversations
with other people in this state

00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:52.820 align:middle line:84%
in-between, and he's not
clear what's going on.

00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:54.680 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening
when you have

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:58.880 align:middle line:84%
a whole cast of characters,
whole planets and scenery

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:01.100 align:middle line:84%
and everything
happening so quickly,

00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:03.830 align:middle line:84%
just seconds away from where
you were when you're not asleep

00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:04.648 align:middle line:90%
yet?

00:55:04.648 --> 00:55:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Well, I think
it's actually exactly

00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.690 align:middle line:84%
as you're describing
very vividly.

00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:10.780 align:middle line:84%
I think we're
stepping in and out

00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:12.820 align:middle line:84%
of not only different
states of consciousness,

00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:14.840 align:middle line:84%
we're stepping in and
out of different scenes,

00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:16.730 align:middle line:84%
different realities,
even different worlds,

00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:17.810 align:middle line:90%
and they're right there.

00:55:17.810 --> 00:55:20.745 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I often feel when
I'm returning from a dream,

00:55:20.745 --> 00:55:22.370 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a sleep
dream or this kind

00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:24.580 align:middle line:84%
of liminal experience,
as if I have literally,

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:26.958 align:middle line:84%
in a just-so fashion, stepped
from one room into another.

00:55:26.958 --> 00:55:28.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's what it feels.

00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: And it's ceased
to be confusing for me.

00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:33.800 align:middle line:84%
But I sometimes won't
write down the experiences

00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:36.230 align:middle line:84%
because they're both so
literal mystic and realistic.

00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:37.040 align:middle line:90%
I was with them.

00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:37.710 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm over here.

00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:38.510 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's fine.

00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:39.650 align:middle line:90%
I know them.

00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:41.358 align:middle line:84%
Will I be with them
again tomorrow night?

00:55:41.358 --> 00:55:42.390 align:middle line:90%
Let's wait and see.

00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:46.190 align:middle line:84%
I think that we are
multidimensional beings

00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:49.490 align:middle line:84%
and our ability to handle and
interpret this and apply it

00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:51.568 align:middle line:84%
to an ordinary reality
is limited by the fact

00:55:51.568 --> 00:55:53.360 align:middle line:84%
that we live in a
three-dimensional reality

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:54.160 align:middle line:90%
plus time.

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:55.247 align:middle line:90%
That's how we are.

00:55:55.247 --> 00:55:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And if we try to operate beyond
that with our physical bodies,

00:55:57.830 --> 00:55:59.210 align:middle line:90%
we'll probably get into trouble.

00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:02.690 align:middle line:84%
But we're talking now about the
fact that in our larger selves,

00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:05.570 align:middle line:84%
in the larger universe, we
are multidimensional beings

00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:08.633 align:middle line:84%
and we are active and engaged on
more than one plane of reality.

00:56:08.633 --> 00:56:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And some of these other
realities, by the way,

00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:11.660 align:middle line:90%
have their own physics.

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:13.370 align:middle line:84%
There are other realities
you go to you actually

00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:15.920 align:middle line:84%
can't jump off the rooftop and
fly because it's not kind of--

00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I
go to that world,

00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:19.040 align:middle line:84%
too, where I can bound from
mountaintop to mountaintop

00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:20.392 align:middle line:90%
in a single bound, yeah.

00:56:20.392 --> 00:56:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: Maybe you can do that,
but that's still not flying.

00:56:22.850 --> 00:56:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So you might bound from the
mountaintops, but not fly.

00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:25.830 align:middle line:90%
So there are--

00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
sometimes it's flying.

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: And sometimes
it's flying.

00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It all depends.

00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: And sometimes
it's breathing underwater

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:31.830 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes it's not.

00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Different physics.

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Different physics.

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I breathe
underwater in dreams, too.

00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:35.740 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:37.573 align:middle line:84%
But it becomes very
interesting, doesn't it,

00:56:37.573 --> 00:56:40.190 align:middle line:84%
to discover that we are
in other universes that

00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:41.480 align:middle line:90%
have their own physics.

00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:44.507 align:middle line:84%
We might have superpowers
compared to what we have here,

00:56:44.507 --> 00:56:46.340 align:middle line:84%
but they're not necessarily
infinite powers.

00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:48.790 align:middle line:84%
There are still physical laws
at work in these universes.

00:56:48.790 --> 00:56:49.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:51.173 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: So what are
we learning about?

00:56:51.173 --> 00:56:52.600 align:middle line:84%
We're learning
about the richness,

00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:54.880 align:middle line:84%
the plenitude of the
multidimensional universe.

00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.990 align:middle line:84%
And let me say, Regina,
when we come back the fact

00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:59.490 align:middle line:84%
that people are feeling sad and
depressed and frustrated and

00:56:59.490 --> 00:57:02.100 align:middle line:84%
angry about the horrible
things going on in our world,

00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:04.050 align:middle line:84%
this is not escapism
to say maybe it

00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:06.030 align:middle line:84%
will be helpful to
remember that you are also

00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:08.782 align:middle line:84%
a citizen of the multi-verse,
the multidimensional universe.

00:57:08.782 --> 00:57:09.990 align:middle line:90%
You have other possibilities.

00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:11.340 align:middle line:90%
You have other connections.

00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:12.840 align:middle line:90%
You have other games to play.

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:14.610 align:middle line:90%
You have other places to fly.

00:57:14.610 --> 00:57:15.900 align:middle line:90%
And maybe you can--

00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:17.850 align:middle line:84%
by spending some more
time there consciously,

00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:21.248 align:middle line:84%
you can bring some joy and
some juice back of this world.

00:57:21.248 --> 00:57:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, in that
imaginable realm because that's

00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:25.380 align:middle line:90%
also where our creations occur.

00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so if people
don't-- they say, oh,

00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:31.050 align:middle line:84%
they're just a daydreamer,
off in their own world.

00:57:31.050 --> 00:57:32.610 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:34.740 align:middle line:84%
This is something
we need to reclaim--

00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:36.820 align:middle line:90%
our right to daydream--

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:38.910 align:middle line:84%
not just night-dream,
but daydream,

00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:40.690 align:middle line:84%
and create these
beautiful realities.

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:41.490 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:42.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Yes.

00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --any final comment?

00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:46.680 align:middle line:84%
I think what you talked
about a little while ago,

00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:49.740 align:middle line:84%
about if you want to dream, if
you've lost your dreams, call

00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:50.730 align:middle line:90%
that part of you back.

00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:52.260 align:middle line:90%
Call the dreamer back, right?

00:57:52.260 --> 00:57:54.090 align:middle line:10%
>>MOSS: And make
a social practice

00:57:54.090 --> 00:57:56.010 align:middle line:10%
out of sharing a
story with a friend.

00:57:56.010 --> 00:57:58.530 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't have to be a
dream-- a personal story--

00:57:58.530 --> 00:58:00.210 align:middle line:10%
and learn how to do
that in a way that

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:02.340 align:middle line:10%
is fast and fun, and
mutually sustaining.

00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:05.400 align:middle line:10%
When we share stories or dreams,
we say, if it were my story,

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:07.230 align:middle line:10%
it were my dream, I'd
think such and such,

00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:08.813 align:middle line:10%
and then this is
what I'd do about it.

00:58:08.813 --> 00:58:10.290 align:middle line:84%
I might do some
shamanic shopping.

00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So having a way to
socialize all of this

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:15.750 align:middle line:84%
and bring something to
the table with a friend

00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:18.085 align:middle line:84%
is one of the great
incentives to bring a dream.

00:58:18.085 --> 00:58:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Or if you don't have a
dream, bring a story anyway.

00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And I just have to
say, on that note,

00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:24.990 align:middle line:84%
I have a couple
friends that just

00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:26.910 align:middle line:90%
laugh at the ridiculousness.

00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:29.160 align:middle line:84%
If I need something
in the physical realm,

00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:30.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm shown a picture.

00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:31.770 align:middle line:90%
It comes in from somewhere.

00:58:31.770 --> 00:58:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm shown a picture
of where to go.

00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:34.080 align:middle line:90%
I'll go there.

00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:36.430 align:middle line:84%
It will be there and it will
usually be half-off, OK.

00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: I love it.

00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It just works like
that to such an absurd extent

00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:42.910 align:middle line:84%
that I always call this one
friend and she just says,

00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:43.710 align:middle line:90%
I hate you.

00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:44.205 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: [LAUGHS]

00:58:44.205 --> 00:58:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How does this work?

00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:45.545 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: I think it's great.

00:58:45.545 --> 00:58:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I need
some new guides.

00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:48.900 align:middle line:84%
But so it's not
surprising that I

00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:51.400 align:middle line:84%
would go to my favorite little
places in that dream world,

00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:52.200 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:53.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's not all--

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.740 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like I'm like a
shopaholic in dream-time.

00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:58.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm not, that's
just here and there.

00:58:58.710 --> 00:59:02.460 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, Robert, it's
been absolutely delightful.

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:04.410 align:middle line:84%
I think that you've
opened up people's minds

00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:09.960 align:middle line:84%
to give us permission to really
put dream-state, both awake

00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:13.260 align:middle line:84%
and asleep, as a priority
in center stage in our life.

00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:18.480 align:middle line:84%
To start creating this vital,
alive, colorful reality

00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:21.000 align:middle line:84%
that so many of us
have lost touch with,

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.100 align:middle line:84%
certainly by the time or
seven or eight years old.

00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MOSS: What a dream
conversation, Regina.

00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:26.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And let's all remember
if we can dream it,

00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:29.760 align:middle line:90%
we might be able to do it.

00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:31.830 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:59:31.830 --> 00:59:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MOSS: Thank you.

00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:35.520 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The title of Robert's
book is "Mysterious Realities."

00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:37.710 align:middle line:10%
You can also take a look
at my previous interviews

00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:40.860 align:middle line:10%
with Robert in the Conscious
Media Network and Gaia archives

00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:42.423 align:middle line:10%
by searching his name there.

00:59:42.423 --> 00:59:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:45.780 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."

00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:47.930 align:middle line:90%
