>>REGINA MEREDITH: I'm
preaching to the choir

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.520 align:middle line:10%
when I tell you that the web
can be a dangerous place,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.110 align:middle line:10%
but I had no idea how
dangerous until I watched a Ted

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.860 align:middle line:10%
Talk by our guest today, Alan
Pearce, author of The Sherlock

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.030 align:middle line:10%
Holmes Handbook for
the Digital Age.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.720 align:middle line:10%
I learned that for
roughly $400, someone

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.310 align:middle line:10%
can be paid to ruin
your entire life.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.960 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to
pay attention here.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And Alan, thank you so
much for writing this book,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.600 align:middle line:84%
and I'm glad I stumbled across
this Ted Talk initially.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually
horrified by a lot

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.780 align:middle line:84%
of what you were saying because
we're innocently using it.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think most people think,
oh, we're innocently using it.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.430 align:middle line:84%
None of this will
ever affect us.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:84%
However, that's not
necessarily true.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.940 align:middle line:84%
But before any of that, I'd
like to go into your background,

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.380 align:middle line:90%
you're a hardcore journalist.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.670 align:middle line:90%
You've been in war zones.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.610 align:middle line:84%
I want you to tell
us what kind of life

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.750 align:middle line:84%
you had as a journalist
in the field.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And I know you've been up
against some horrendous

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.480 align:middle line:90%
situations yourself.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>>ALAN PEARCE: Yeah,
it's a funny business.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.450 align:middle line:10%
I don't like to say
war correspondent.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.430 align:middle line:10%
I like to say Foreign
Affairs specialist.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.130 align:middle line:10%
And I found myself
in Afghanistan.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.950 align:middle line:84%
I'd been covering wars for
years, mostly in Southeast Asia.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.560 align:middle line:84%
I'd covered the Khmer Rouge war
in Cambodia for a long time.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you've been
doing this for a long time.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Oh, yeah,
for a long time.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When did
you start your--

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.660 align:middle line:84%
when did your career
start, as a young pup?

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.840 align:middle line:10%
>>PEARCE: No, funnily enough,
probably in my very late 20s,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.510 align:middle line:10%
early 30s.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.510 align:middle line:10%
You just stumbled on it.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.550 align:middle line:10%
I don't think a lot of people
choose to go to war, per se.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.350 align:middle line:90%
It happens.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.767 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, how
did you end up--

00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:50.670 align:middle line:84%
OK, were you studying
Pol Pot at the time?

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.920 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.045 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, I actually
found myself in Thailand

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:55.028 align:middle line:84%
on a kind of free
vacation, and I

00:01:55.028 --> 00:01:56.320 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to go to the beach.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.987 align:middle line:84%
So I thought I'd go
to the refugee camps

00:01:57.987 --> 00:01:59.420 align:middle line:90%
on the Thai-Cambodian border.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: As one
does on vacation.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.403 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Of course.

00:02:01.403 --> 00:02:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself
getting hooked, as you do.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.930 align:middle line:84%
People's stories-- they
were just so fascinating.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:84%
So I spent some time trying
to get inside to Cambodia

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.450 align:middle line:84%
with the different resistance
groups and managed to do that.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And then in time,
the Khmer Rouge

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.240 align:middle line:84%
were kicked out
by the Vietnamese.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And the Vietnamese
were in control.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.680 align:middle line:10%
And when they left, I
was the first journalist

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.150 align:middle line:10%
I'm aware of that
based themselves

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.070 align:middle line:10%
in the capital, Phnom Penh,
which was like a ghost town.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.570 align:middle line:90%
It was beyond scary.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And so I did that for a long
time, that sort of thing.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And I covered the war, going
out with government forces,

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.860 align:middle line:84%
and then when the United
Nations turned up,

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.460 align:middle line:84%
going out with different
UN units and so on.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.770 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a way of life.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.570 align:middle line:90%
It just--

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, you were born to do it.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.520 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well,
here's the thing,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.810 align:middle line:84%
if you're doing that
in any given day,

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.030 align:middle line:84%
you see the very
worst in humanity.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And you also see the very best
in humanity if you're lucky.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Yeah, you meet
the most wonderful people,

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.290 align:middle line:90%
brave people.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I came out with post-traumatic
stress disorder,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.470 align:middle line:90%
so an awful lot do.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.777 align:middle line:84%
And what gets me is
kindness and bravery.

00:03:04.777 --> 00:03:07.110 align:middle line:84%
If I'm watching a movie, it's
got kindness and bravery--

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, you're in tears.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.850 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: --I'm in tears.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:09.970 align:middle line:90%
I have to hide my face.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot of soldiers
find themselves doing this now.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.832 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Kindness and
bravery gets me every time.

00:03:15.832 --> 00:03:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you've
witnessed it firsthand

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.743 align:middle line:90%
in extreme circumstances.

00:03:18.743 --> 00:03:19.543 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:03:19.543 --> 00:03:21.593 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you moved
out of Southeast Asia.

00:03:21.593 --> 00:03:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Yeah, I
just stopped doing it.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.860 align:middle line:84%
I didn't get injured or
anything at that time.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.010 align:middle line:90%
I go back to London.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm working on the desk at the
BBC, and I'm getting bored.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting bored.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What did
they have working on?

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.397 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, I
was just doing--

00:03:33.397 --> 00:03:35.260 align:middle line:84%
I was working on the
Southeast Asia desk,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.170 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just writing
news bulletins

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.590 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.790 align:middle line:90%
And it's OK.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.380 align:middle line:84%
I kind of like it,
but not as much.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're a field guy.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.463 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yes, I shouldn't stop.

00:03:43.463 --> 00:03:47.772 align:middle line:84%
So the post of Afghanistan came
up, the Kabul correspondent,

00:03:47.772 --> 00:03:50.230 align:middle line:84%
which was supposed to be the
most dangerous place on Earth.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kabul, yes.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: This is '96.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.090 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time
the Taliban took over.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.180 align:middle line:84%
So I arrived directly
into a siege.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.020 align:middle line:84%
I spent 10 months under Taliban
siege, being shelled every day.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.280 align:middle line:90%
And it was beyond grisly.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.272 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just beyond anything you
could ever imagine, the sadness.

00:04:10.272 --> 00:04:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you go,
something will happen.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.660 align:middle line:84%
A stick of rockets will
hit an apartment block,

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.410 align:middle line:84%
and there'd be a whole
bunch of dead kids.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.740 align:middle line:84%
Or people are queuing
for water at a pump,

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and mortars come
in and kill them.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.100 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what
was your protection

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.510 align:middle line:90%
as a foreign journalist?

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Oh, there's
no protection.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you just
go at your own risk.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.890 align:middle line:84%
They just say, go
at your own risk.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.060 align:middle line:90%
And was this for the BBC?

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: This for the BBC.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.115 align:middle line:90%
But that's how I prefer it.

00:04:33.115 --> 00:04:35.400 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't want an armed
guard, because how am I

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.540 align:middle line:84%
going to talk to people
if I got a guy with an AK?

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.010 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to work.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.900 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I was enjoying it,
but it was horribly tense.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was losing weight,
and I wasn't eating well.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And I kept catching
various diseases

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.620 align:middle line:84%
because the water wasn't
purified or anything.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.340 align:middle line:84%
So I had about six or
seven intestinal diseases

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.420 align:middle line:90%
by the time I got out.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.520 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, the Taliban took over.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.170 align:middle line:90%
And so there we are.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Because it became a
reasonably large story,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.450 align:middle line:84%
there was quite
a few journalists

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.550 align:middle line:90%
at this first press conference.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.380 align:middle line:84%
The guy says, we have
two major announcements.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.050 align:middle line:84%
One, we declare
Afghanistan an Emirate.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing
we want to tell you

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.950 align:middle line:84%
is that we sentenced the
BBC correspondent to death.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting there in
my chair and waiting for--

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were you the
only BBC correspondent?

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: I'm the only
BBC correspondent.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.350 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sitting in
this chair, and I'm

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.330 align:middle line:84%
waiting for someone to come
and lift me out of the chair

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.240 align:middle line:90%
and take me away.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.040 align:middle line:90%
And they don't.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.690 align:middle line:84%
So I go back to the
office, and I call London.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And I say, hey, guys, I've
just been sentenced to death.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Oh, Alan, you don't
need worry about that.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.280 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thinking, that
doesn't seem right.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I carried on for about
three weeks, and part of the job

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.340 align:middle line:84%
used to be crossing the front
lines from government forces

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.220 align:middle line:90%
to Taliban.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Now it was Taliban
to government forces.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.490 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to
cross the front lines,

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.850 align:middle line:84%
and we come up against
a Taliban checkpoint.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.630 align:middle line:90%
And they are beyond jumpy.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.610 align:middle line:84%
They've obviously been
in action that day.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.190 align:middle line:84%
They're probably all stoned,
looking at their eyes.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And I said to the driver,
let's get out of here.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.320 align:middle line:90%
We'd take another route.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.698 align:middle line:84%
Instead of putting the
Land Rover into reverse,

00:06:09.698 --> 00:06:12.240 align:middle line:84%
he put it into first gear and
drove straight into two Taliban

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.050 align:middle line:90%
and knocked them over.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh, oh.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: They got up.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.225 align:middle line:84%
Kindly, they didn't start
spraying us with their AKs.

00:06:17.225 --> 00:06:18.600 align:middle line:84%
They just beat in
the windscreen.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.620 align:middle line:90%
And my door gets yanked open.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm pulled out.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And this one-legged Mullah
comes along, and he's shouting.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Turns out he's
shouting, it's the BBC.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.210 align:middle line:90%
Kill them all.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And so they try and hang me,
but there weren't any trees.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.885 align:middle line:90%
So they throttled me.

00:06:34.885 --> 00:06:37.260 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] I was pinned up
against the side of the Landy,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.125 align:middle line:84%
and they throttled me
to unconsciousness.

00:06:39.125 --> 00:06:40.500 align:middle line:84%
They probably
thought I was dead.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They did what to you?

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.890 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Throttled me--

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:42.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Throttled you.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.350 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: --to unconsciousness.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.590 align:middle line:90%
But it's not like in a movie.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going like this.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.720 align:middle line:84%
It's just like-- I don't
know, like a Vulcan death grip

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.290 align:middle line:90%
in Star Trek or something.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.670 align:middle line:90%
One minute I'm there.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.280 align:middle line:90%
The next it just goes black.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And then I woke up, came to
in the back of the Land Rover.

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:57.910 align:middle line:90%
And we're driving away.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:84%
A commander had shown up, who
was a professional soldier.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.260 align:middle line:90%
He said, what are you doing?

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.670 align:middle line:90%
Get this guy out of here.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.360 align:middle line:90%
And that was that.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.288 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know they'd
broken my neck.

00:07:08.288 --> 00:07:09.580 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know for three months.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.747 align:middle line:84%
This often happens to
professional football players,

00:07:11.747 --> 00:07:13.000 align:middle line:90%
rugby players, and so on.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I woke up three months later
not working for the BBC

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.760 align:middle line:84%
anymore, because my
contract had expired.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't move my arms,
and I was in diabolical pain.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.040 align:middle line:84%
So I spent about the
next couple of years--

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.120 align:middle line:84%
semi-paralyzed is
an exaggeration,

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.760 align:middle line:90%
but it was a bit like that.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.210 align:middle line:84%
This led me to getting involved
in the training of journalists

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.390 align:middle line:84%
to operate in war zones,
the things you need to know

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and you need to know a lot,
and an awful lot of journalists

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.490 align:middle line:84%
will turn up not knowing, not
even knowing basic first aid,

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:43.440 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.210 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you're with a colleague,
and they get shot in the chest.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.410 align:middle line:90%
What do you do about it?

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:48.510 align:middle line:90%
They don't know.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, the BBC
very kindly sent me

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.660 align:middle line:90%
on a proper training course.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm a qualified battlefield
medic as a consequence of this,

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.000 align:middle line:90%
and there's so much to know.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.620 align:middle line:84%
But mostly,
journalists don't know.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.010 align:middle line:84%
So a friend of mine set
up a training course

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.035 align:middle line:84%
to train journalists,
and we got two SAS guys,

00:08:06.035 --> 00:08:06.910 align:middle line:90%
Special Air Service--

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: --and the SAS doctor.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And he teaches battlefield
medical things,

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.930 align:middle line:84%
but way beyond what the regular
infantry do, way beyond that.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And these guys taught us so
much in basically a weekend.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:22.510 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.138 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Things you don't
learn in basic medic training.

00:08:25.138 --> 00:08:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Not what
you would normally

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.230 align:middle line:84%
learn, like stuff that would
make most people cringe.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.778 align:middle line:84%
I'm not doing that, but you
will do it to save a life.

00:08:33.778 --> 00:08:35.320 align:middle line:84%
After time-- because
I'm then getting

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.940 align:middle line:84%
involved in this
training course,

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and I'm giving talks
about this or that

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.500 align:middle line:90%
and firearms and whatever.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.748 align:middle line:84%
And my wife, private
investigator, we

00:08:45.748 --> 00:08:47.540 align:middle line:84%
were having dinner with
one of her clients.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.350 align:middle line:84%
He's a former special
branch officer,

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:50.880 align:middle line:90%
which is like the top end.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.880 align:middle line:84%
He was a former undercover
agent, and so forth.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And over dinner, he's telling
us about all the things

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.800 align:middle line:84%
that they can't see
on the internet.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, oh,
yeah, like what?

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm plugging him very gently,
and he twigs eventually.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.650 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sucking too much
information out of him,

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.010 align:middle line:90%
and he just clams up.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.850 align:middle line:84%
But he told me enough that
I could go away and reverse

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.030 align:middle line:90%
engineer it.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And I found out how journalists
can operate on the internet,

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.150 align:middle line:84%
under the radar, how you can
communicate without people

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.540 align:middle line:84%
intercepting your
communications, how

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.390 align:middle line:84%
you can protect your
sources, for example.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Supposing you're in a
war zone, and you got

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.070 align:middle line:90%
photographs of a mass grave.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.530 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to get
them out of the country?

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can hide them
in all sorts of ways.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.460 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful thing
called steganography.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.060 align:middle line:84%
So let's say I've got a
whole bunch of photographs

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.990 align:middle line:90%
of a mass grave.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.430 align:middle line:84%
I can put them inside,
say, a Britney Spears album

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:47.800 align:middle line:90%
on my iPhone.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Hide it inside a particular
track or all the tracks,

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.570 align:middle line:90%
one photograph inside the track.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.420 align:middle line:84%
Unless you've got prior
knowledge, you would never know.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:56.800 align:middle line:90%
You get out the other end.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:02.190 align:middle line:10%
You run the album through
a steganography program,

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:10%
and out pop your photographs.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:04.862 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my God.

00:10:04.862 --> 00:10:07.320 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: So I was teaching
journalists how to do all this.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, did you back
engineer it and figure it

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.520 align:middle line:84%
out yourself, or did they give
you some hints of how to do it?

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: He only gave me enough
to know that it can be done.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
they're doing it.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.980 align:middle line:84%
That took me a long time,
to find these things out.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.875 align:middle line:84%
And I found them for
a variety of ways.

00:10:22.875 --> 00:10:23.675 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:23.675 --> 00:10:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Then I found,
there was a thing

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.320 align:middle line:90%
called the Occupy Movement.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.903 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
anyone remembers that.

00:10:27.903 --> 00:10:28.703 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:10:28.703 --> 00:10:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And I was
training their people how

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.090 align:middle line:90%
to communicate under the radar.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I can
write a book about this.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So I just started
writing a book,

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.160 align:middle line:84%
and I wrote one book that had
everything in it, all of it.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And it occurred to
me that no one really

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.890 align:middle line:84%
is ever going to buy a
cybersecurity handbook

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:47.690 align:middle line:90%
and read it.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.130 align:middle line:90%
People just don't do that.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.760 align:middle line:10%
So I thought I would
write a Sherlock Holmes

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.400 align:middle line:10%
story, the world's
best detective,

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:10%
told through the words of
his sidekick, Dr. Watson.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's a full-on
Sherlock Holmes story.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:02.660 align:middle line:84%
But when you get
to the end of it,

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:07.390 align:middle line:84%
you realize you've absorbed
so much knowledge almost

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:08.320 align:middle line:90%
by osmosis.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.170 align:middle line:90%
You don't know.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And you've just
had a fun journey.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.645 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, how fascinating.

00:11:12.645 --> 00:11:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And show how to
hide things inside things

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.650 align:middle line:90%
and how to communicate.

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example,
the FBI or whoever

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.920 align:middle line:84%
will be monitoring people's
emails or their WhatsApp

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.210 align:middle line:84%
if they can, even
though it's encrypted.

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Crooks and terrorists
don't operate that way.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.700 align:middle line:84%
They would operate inside
things like World of Warcraft,

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.328 align:middle line:84%
where you can, within the
game, you've got chat facility.

00:11:38.328 --> 00:11:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're talking
about bombs and guns

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.860 align:middle line:84%
within World of
Warcraft, that's not

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.280 align:middle line:90%
going to ring the alarm bells.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So they will
communicate that way.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.770 align:middle line:84%
They might even communicate in
something like My Little Pony

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.690 align:middle line:90%
World and talk in code.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:51.600 align:middle line:90%
And don't say "bomb."

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Say "birthday cake," and so on.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.270 align:middle line:84%
So I was showing people
how you can do this.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:57.420 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.700 align:middle line:84%
So I'm taking all the
dark arts, as it were,

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.510 align:middle line:84%
and I'm employing them for
the power of good, showing

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.640 align:middle line:84%
journalists, and eventually
human rights lawyers,

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.950 align:middle line:84%
how they can communicate
with their clients

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:08.868 align:middle line:90%
and gather and retain--

00:12:08.868 --> 00:12:09.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Without being--

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Without having--

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.855 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --surveilled.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: --someone
looking over your shoulder.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a complete
joke that we are all

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.360 align:middle line:84%
being monitored all the time
by all-- because they do it

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.220 align:middle line:90%
because they can.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.270 align:middle line:90%
And why wouldn't you if you can?

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but they're not really
going to gain anything by--

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What a massive waste.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: I mean,
reading my mom's emails.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:29.925 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what are they
going to get from that?

00:12:29.925 --> 00:12:30.942 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:12:30.942 --> 00:12:31.775 align:middle line:90%
And the terrorists--

00:12:31.775 --> 00:12:33.245 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Bakewell
tart recipe, maybe.

00:12:33.245 --> 00:12:33.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.770 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.670 align:middle line:84%
But the terrorists and the drug
dealers and the arms dealers

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and all the rest of it, they're
using the dark web, which

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.790 align:middle line:90%
is a part of the internet.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:44.140 align:middle line:84%
The internet-- I mean, if
you think of the internet,

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.140 align:middle line:90%
think of an iceberg.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And the surface web, like
an iceberg, is what we use,

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.030 align:middle line:84%
if you're using
Google or whatever.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.300 align:middle line:84%
They're really only indexing the
things people are interested in.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.940 align:middle line:84%
There's so much on the internet
that no one's interested in.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:58.900 align:middle line:90%
There's databases.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.067 align:middle line:90%
There's all sorts of things.

00:13:00.067 --> 00:13:01.420 align:middle line:90%
They don't search inside there.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.000 align:middle line:84%
So the internet is
like an iceberg.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:84%
You see what's above, but
there's a massive amount

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.180 align:middle line:90%
underneath.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And within the massive amount
underneath are the dark webs.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.500 align:middle line:84%
I can't say how many there are,
because the whole nature is

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.650 align:middle line:90%
that they're secret.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.150 align:middle line:84%
But there's one
we do know about,

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.650 align:middle line:84%
which is the Tor network, which
is actually set up by the US

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Navy way back as a means
for them to communicate

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.720 align:middle line:84%
surreptitiously
amongst themselves.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.880 align:middle line:84%
That somehow got out into the
wild, into the real world,

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.210 align:middle line:84%
and other people
started using it.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.830 align:middle line:84%
It's just like the
regular internet,

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.710 align:middle line:84%
but it's a bit like
the old dial-up,

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.490 align:middle line:84%
that it's all kind
of slow and clunky,

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.010 align:middle line:84%
because what you're
doing, you're

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:41.890 align:middle line:84%
not just you connecting at
home on your laptop direct

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:42.770 align:middle line:90%
to a website.

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:45.380 align:middle line:10%
You're going entirely
around the globe,

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.650 align:middle line:10%
bouncing off different devices
all the way around the world,

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:51.370 align:middle line:10%
so it's impossible to trace
you back to your source.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's all a bit
clunky and slow.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Once you're in there, if
I wanted to buy an AK-47,

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.770 align:middle line:84%
for example, I
can do it so easy.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is,
people aren't going

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.870 align:middle line:84%
to cheat you so much because
you use a system of escrow

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.310 align:middle line:90%
where I want to buy an AK-47.

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:08.870 align:middle line:90%
Let's say it's $500.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:12.890 align:middle line:84%
I put $500 into
escrow from a website.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.570 align:middle line:90%
That's the marketplace.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:17.360 align:middle line:84%
The dealer sends me the
AK, which, incidentally,

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.820 align:middle line:84%
they break down
into parts and put

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.832 align:middle line:84%
inside things like fax machines
and other bits of kit like that.

00:14:21.832 --> 00:14:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And then it arrives,
and you assemble it.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:27.700 align:middle line:84%
You look on YouTube, see how
to put together an AK-47.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And then you release the
money from escrow and so on.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Drug dealers work in
exactly the same way,

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.430 align:middle line:84%
but the tools that they're
using are the tools

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.710 align:middle line:84%
that I know that journalists
and human rights lawyers

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.460 align:middle line:90%
could really be using.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And to be a journalist,
if I say my mom's emails

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.755 align:middle line:84%
are being read, you
can bet your life,

00:14:46.755 --> 00:14:49.130 align:middle line:84%
if you're a proper journalist,
that they are watching you

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:49.950 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:51.158 align:middle line:90%
Now, I don't just mean that--

00:14:51.158 --> 00:14:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, this is true.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: But everywhere.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:90%
I't's every--

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Every agency.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:56.867 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: It goes like this.

00:14:56.867 --> 00:15:00.483 align:middle line:84%
You'd be stupid if you
didn't, so they do.

00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:01.650 align:middle line:90%
They will gather everything.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.420 align:middle line:84%
It's not like one person
is reading your emails.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.545 align:middle line:84%
It's a computer, and they're
looking for key words,

00:15:05.545 --> 00:15:08.275 align:middle line:84%
like "bomb" and so forth,
and "kill" and "president"

00:15:08.275 --> 00:15:09.150 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.438 align:middle line:84%
And if they all pop up
in the same message,

00:15:11.438 --> 00:15:12.980 align:middle line:84%
they'll come and
get you in some way.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.438 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You do
a funny little bit

00:15:14.438 --> 00:15:17.030 align:middle line:84%
about-- write this in
an email to someone,

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.738 align:middle line:84%
sprinkle those words
through, and see

00:15:18.738 --> 00:15:20.030 align:middle line:90%
how quickly you get a reaction.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: --if you
don't believe me.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:21.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Next time, you
write to your mom.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:23.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So--

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:23.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I have a
couple of questions.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.040 align:middle line:84%
One of them is, you
were teaching this

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.105 align:middle line:90%
openly or covertly?

00:15:29.105 --> 00:15:30.480 align:middle line:10%
>>PEARCE: Oh, no,
openly, openly.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so did any
kind of governmental agencies

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.800 align:middle line:90%
bother you at all?

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: They don't
know what I'm teaching.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000 align:middle line:84%
They're probably not
sending anyone on a course.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a bunch of journos
learning first aid,

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:42.797 align:middle line:90%
learning about firearms.

00:15:42.797 --> 00:15:44.255 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they
have no idea, OK.

00:15:44.255 --> 00:15:46.360 align:middle line:90%
And then what I wonder--

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.600 align:middle line:84%
OK, before we drill
down into this

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.930 align:middle line:90%
a little further, when the NSA--

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:55.230 align:middle line:84%
and certainly, Edward Snowden
made this known to all of us--

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:59.010 align:middle line:84%
is gathering information on--
documentaries have been made--

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:02.130 align:middle line:90%
all of its citizens, like this--

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:04.660 align:middle line:84%
you think, why would
they be so stupid?

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Why would they waste
so much energy?

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Except, if they're looking
for societal memes,

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.610 align:middle line:84%
for continued manipulation
of our emotions and--

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:15.410 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Yeah, there's more
to it than they would claim.

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Please, please
talk about that a little bit

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:19.830 align:middle line:90%
so we understand.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.520 align:middle line:90%
They're not just wasting money.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.380 align:middle line:84%
They're doing their
own stuff with it.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what they're
doing in your opinion.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:26.647 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: I think
most governments

00:16:26.647 --> 00:16:28.800 align:middle line:84%
would like to know what
their populace is thinking.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.640 align:middle line:90%
It goes like that.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.923 align:middle line:84%
And you can very
easily do these things.

00:16:32.923 --> 00:16:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can get
societal sentiment

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.560 align:middle line:84%
in a glimpse with
the algorithms.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Exactly.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And the way tech is moving
forward all the time,

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.480 align:middle line:90%
and data storage is so easy.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.600 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you make a phone
call on your cell phone.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.660 align:middle line:84%
No one's listening, but
it's being recorded.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's being stored
somewhere in some database.

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:52.340 align:middle line:84%
If, at some point in the future,
you come to their attention,

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.010 align:middle line:84%
they can go back into
your phone records

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.230 align:middle line:84%
and listen to all your
phone calls, for example.

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's happening
to all of us.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:59.510 align:middle line:90%
No one knows--

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.160 align:middle line:84%
People don't know
this, generally.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.720 align:middle line:90%
That's just one example.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:07.300 align:middle line:84%
If you can think of any
means that a government might

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:11.079 align:middle line:84%
use to spy on its
citizens, they're

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:12.770 align:middle line:90%
using every one of those means.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:13.880 align:middle line:90%
They really are.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.819 align:middle line:90%
And they're also incredibly lax.

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:19.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not as if we're all
up to no good or anything,

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:22.420 align:middle line:84%
but I don't like somebody
looking over my shoulder

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.960 align:middle line:90%
if I'm reading an article.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.359 align:middle line:84%
It's just an
uncomfortable feeling.

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And also, too, the more
information you put online--

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.060 align:middle line:84%
everyone's giving away
so much information.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:35.540 align:middle line:84%
You go to someone's
Facebook page--

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.670 align:middle line:84%
my wife's a private
investigator.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:40.500 align:middle line:84%
First thing she does when
is tracking someone down,

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.640 align:middle line:90%
she goes to Facebook.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.890 align:middle line:84%
She finds all the
social media things.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:47.450 align:middle line:84%
She finds out the
mother's maiden name,

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.820 align:middle line:84%
the person's mother's maiden
name, his date of birth.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.980 align:middle line:84%
With that, you can
start opening databases.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.050 align:middle line:84%
You can start doing
all manner of things.

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Don't post things
like that online.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Don't say, I'm going on
vacation or post pictures

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:01.840 align:middle line:84%
from the Bahamas, because
someone is interested in you

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.048 align:middle line:90%
will know your home is empty.

00:18:03.048 --> 00:18:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And they can come round
and burgle your home.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is
just baseline stuff.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Oh, this
is just so easy.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.880 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to say the
streets are safer today

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.020 align:middle line:84%
because so many criminals
have moved online.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's what
I was going to ask you.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.210 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, there have to be
some estimates of how much crime

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:20.580 align:middle line:84%
is left on the streets when you
can just do it in a cyber world.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: I mean, there's
still crime on the streets.

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:26.330 align:middle line:84%
You could be sitting in
an outdoor cafe looking

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.040 align:middle line:84%
on your brand-new
iPhone, and someone's

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.670 align:middle line:84%
going to whip it out of
your hand in no time.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You have a drive by.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:31.797 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah, all of that.

00:18:31.797 --> 00:18:32.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: There's so
many ways of getting you.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.050 align:middle line:90%
There's so many ways, yeah.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:38.820 align:middle line:84%
People's heartstrings,
for example-- one

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:42.510 align:middle line:84%
of the worst things
they do, posing, say,

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:46.680 align:middle line:84%
as a member of the US
military and saying, I'm

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.430 align:middle line:84%
looking for love and
friendship and stuff.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And then they will
form a relationship

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:51.220 align:middle line:90%
with somebody online.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.470 align:middle line:90%
And then, we're going to meet.

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:53.678 align:middle line:90%
We're going to meet Thursday.

00:18:53.678 --> 00:18:55.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to fly down
to Florida and meet you.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, I
can't-- you get to that date,

00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.243 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't make it.

00:18:59.243 --> 00:19:00.910 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't get on the
plane or whatever.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:03.630 align:middle line:84%
My mother's sick, and I've
got to pay for an operation.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:04.630 align:middle line:90%
I haven't got the money.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And next thing people
are handing over money.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.810 align:middle line:90%
This is normal.

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:09.033 align:middle line:90%
This is happening every day.

00:19:09.033 --> 00:19:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you always
have your Nigerian princes.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.150 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: All of those.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.525 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how many times have
we all had ridiculous emails?

00:19:14.525 --> 00:19:18.630 align:middle line:84%
I am so and so, the daughter of
the Nigerian finance minister.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.440 align:middle line:10%
I have $57 million.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Can we place it in your
account for safekeeping?

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.336 align:middle line:84%
Why are they picking
me out of the ether?

00:19:25.336 --> 00:19:28.210 align:middle line:84%
People fall for it, or they
wouldn't keep doing it.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there are
rooms full of people

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:34.250 align:middle line:84%
doing this on a daily basis,
pulling at heartstrings.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.382 align:middle line:84%
And that's the worst
one, the heartstrings,

00:19:36.382 --> 00:19:38.090 align:middle line:84%
because you're not
only breaking a heart.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:39.757 align:middle line:84%
You're emptying
somebody's bank account.

00:19:39.757 --> 00:19:40.970 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just horrendous.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.200 align:middle line:90%
And that's just one example.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.825 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're
going to get down

00:19:43.825 --> 00:19:45.140 align:middle line:90%
to what you can get for $400.

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.650 align:middle line:84%
That's what really drew
me into your conversation.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Before we get
there, OK, so we're

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle line:84%
giving away all of this
personal information

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:57.550 align:middle line:84%
through Facebook and to
Instagram and everywhere else.

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:00.400 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
we're a consumer who's

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.040 align:middle line:84%
just going on and constantly
being bombarded with come-ons?

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And we sign up for sales
of all kinds everywhere.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happens to us, where
you're on all these websites?

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Well, OK.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.545 align:middle line:90%
If you're not--

00:20:14.545 --> 00:20:17.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sign up here in
order to get our 50% off sale.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:18.355 align:middle line:90%
Women do this.

00:20:18.355 --> 00:20:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: If you're not
paying, you're the product.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.385 align:middle line:90%
That's what they say.

00:20:21.385 --> 00:20:22.185 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:22.185 --> 00:20:24.670 align:middle line:90%
Now, they will try every--

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:26.775 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't even
know where to begin.

00:20:26.775 --> 00:20:28.150 align:middle line:84%
There's just so
much I could say.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:29.692 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just, this
is for the women

00:20:29.692 --> 00:20:32.340 align:middle line:84%
in the audience that tend to
really fall for a lot of this.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: OK, well, I talked
to the heartbreak scams.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.810 align:middle line:90%
So there's those.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The sale,
savings, money scams.

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:44.360 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: OK, I don't really
know what I could say--

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, other than
that they're just gathering--

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:47.480 align:middle line:90%
you're putting your personal--

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.765 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: You're giving out
just too much information.

00:20:49.765 --> 00:20:50.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Too many sources.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.420 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Yeah, and it's
private data storage companies

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.070 align:middle line:84%
that will sell on
your information

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:58.350 align:middle line:84%
to somebody, your voting
preferences, your education,

00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:59.700 align:middle line:90%
what you'd like to read.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't want people
to know this about me,

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.530 align:middle line:90%
unless I choose to tell them.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.640 align:middle line:84%
I just don't want that
information shared.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.320 align:middle line:84%
It makes me feel
horribly uncomfortable.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And then they're going to
specifically target you

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.023 align:middle line:84%
because there's an
election coming up,

00:21:11.023 --> 00:21:14.400 align:middle line:84%
and they may think you're
a swing voter or something.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And they'll push and
push and push and push,

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.800 align:middle line:84%
and they know what buttons
to press because they

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.030 align:middle line:90%
know what you like.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.745 align:middle line:84%
And they know what
you don't like.

00:21:21.745 --> 00:21:24.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can be
purchasing on retail sites that

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:30.000 align:middle line:84%
have similar qualities that
would maybe be more, say,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.070 align:middle line:84%
clothing lines,
more associated with

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:36.500 align:middle line:84%
anthroposophical, liberal
people versus the conservatives

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.300 align:middle line:90%
and such.

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And even from that, they
can start targeting you.

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah, do you--

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:42.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Everything
compiles a profile.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: I'd like to
do everything secretly,

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.682 align:middle line:84%
even though I've
got nothing to hide.

00:21:45.682 --> 00:21:48.720 align:middle line:84%
So anyone who's using the
internet, using a browser,

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.972 align:middle line:84%
just take Chrome for an example,
on the right-hand corner,

00:21:51.972 --> 00:21:53.430 align:middle line:84%
there's a button
you can press that

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:57.060 align:middle line:90%
makes that browser go private.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:00.100 align:middle line:84%
What that means is it's
not taking on any cookies.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.510 align:middle line:90%
You visit a website.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:03.060 align:middle line:90%
You're not taking any cookies.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.590 align:middle line:84%
When you close
down that browser,

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.130 align:middle line:84%
everything that you've done
vanishes into the ether.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:09.640 align:middle line:90%
That's not on your computer.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.307 align:middle line:84%
Let's suppose you wanted to buy
your husband a birthday present,

00:22:12.307 --> 00:22:13.560 align:middle line:90%
and he wanted to research it.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And the next time the
husband picks up your phone

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.980 align:middle line:84%
or looks over your shoulder,
and up comes this--

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.092 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, pop-ups.

00:22:21.092 --> 00:22:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: You've been
researching cruises

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.070 align:middle line:90%
to the Bahamas, right?

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.870 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:25.930 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah, game given away.

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So just
on that level--

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:27.750 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: So just that.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're
talking incognito.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: So you can just
say you're incognito,

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.770 align:middle line:84%
and you just do all
that research that way.

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And tell people how
easy it is to find incognito.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Just
private or incognito.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:38.170 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:38.590 align:middle line:90%
Just do that.

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Under
your preferences.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: I do that a
lot, I mean, just a lot.

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:46.400 align:middle line:84%
When I look at my-- oh, no,
let's say, reading a newspaper,

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.390 align:middle line:84%
all the ads that pop up
on that newspaper online

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:53.330 align:middle line:84%
have something to do with my
recent searching preferences.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I was
talking to a friend

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.290 align:middle line:84%
about going to Venice for
a holiday, for a vacation.

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Next thing I know, I'm
getting hotels in Venice.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting cheap
flights to Venice.

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:05.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting all sorts of--

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:07.487 align:middle line:84%
that just makes me feel
horribly uncomfortable.

00:23:07.487 --> 00:23:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yeah, OK--

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.278 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: But that's
the soft side of it.

00:23:10.278 --> 00:23:12.737 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, let me give
you more of the soft side of it

00:23:12.737 --> 00:23:13.700 align:middle line:90%
that I think is creepy.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:19.428 align:middle line:84%
So I have a roomie who's an
old friend of mine, Stephanie.

00:23:19.428 --> 00:23:22.820 align:middle line:84%
When I searched something,
she gets the pop-ups on.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.310 align:middle line:10%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:25.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it makes you wonder.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I wonder,
and I can't prove this--

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sometimes, we'll
just be talking about--

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Oh, yeah.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.925 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm saying, we're
just talking about something,

00:23:31.925 --> 00:23:34.200 align:middle line:84%
and she gets the
pop-ups for that.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.263 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: OK, you got
an Alexa on your desk?

00:23:36.263 --> 00:23:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't
even have Alexa,

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.360 align:middle line:84%
but we have our cell
phones sitting there.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.520 align:middle line:10%
>>PEARCE: Well, if you've
got one of these devices--

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.830 align:middle line:10%
and I won't say specifically
they're doing this, they're not,

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.130 align:middle line:10%
because maybe they'll sue
me because I can't prove it.

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:47.880 align:middle line:10%
All of that's being recorded.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.320 align:middle line:90%
Everything's being recorded.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.850 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be surprised
if you're watching TV,

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:55.213 align:middle line:84%
and your conversations
are being recorded,

00:23:55.213 --> 00:23:57.380 align:middle line:84%
because they'd like to know
your viewing preferences

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.338 align:middle line:90%
and that kind of thing.

00:23:58.338 --> 00:24:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think so,
because sometimes, I'll

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:03.180 align:middle line:84%
notice I'll hear
this little ding.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's taking a
text of everything

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying on my
phone, and I have not.

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: I honestly believe we
are being listened to in ways I

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:14.610 align:middle line:90%
cannot prove.

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:15.660 align:middle line:90%
How can I even prove it?

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:16.530 align:middle line:90%
But they are.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:17.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm convinced it.

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And your example
of your friend--

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:20.660 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Getting things
I'm talking about.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Was that coincidence?

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:24.140 align:middle line:90%
And in the intelligence world--

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it
happens all the time.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.270 align:middle line:90%
It's not a coincidence.

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: In the intelligence
world, there's no such thing.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:31.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that means they're
picking up whatever I'm saying,

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's being distributed to
her and in close proximity.

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:36.155 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Yeah, if
you're up to no good, OK,

00:24:36.155 --> 00:24:37.030 align:middle line:90%
that's another thing.

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:39.850 align:middle line:84%
But if you're just choosing
a gift for a friend,

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:40.810 align:middle line:90%
it's just horrible.

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:41.830 align:middle line:90%
It's just not right.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:45.540 align:middle line:84%
So you take that further, and
I would train a journalist

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.080 align:middle line:90%
or human rights lawyer--

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:51.600 align:middle line:84%
they can communicate with their
client or a source for a story

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.580 align:middle line:84%
and not have somebody
intercepting their emails.

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:57.523 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people using WhatsApp,
it's end-to-end encryption.

00:24:57.523 --> 00:24:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It says,
but you say it's not.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:00.773 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: You want
to get around that.

00:25:00.773 --> 00:25:04.500 align:middle line:84%
You put a drive-by download
into your phone or your laptop

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.330 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, and they just
read what's on the screen.

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:08.853 align:middle line:90%
So it doesn't matter.

00:25:08.853 --> 00:25:10.853 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Wait, so hold
on-- drive-by downloads.

00:25:10.853 --> 00:25:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us--

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.435 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: So you
visit a website.

00:25:13.435 --> 00:25:15.340 align:middle line:90%
You get an email--

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.740 align:middle line:84%
we're having a
fantastic sale, 50% off.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And you think, well, I bought
boots from them before.

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:20.925 align:middle line:90%
That's not a problem.

00:25:20.925 --> 00:25:22.060 align:middle line:90%
But it's not them.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And you go and click on the
button, and you get there.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's a blank
page, or maybe it's a--

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.680 align:middle line:90%
it is a page that looks normal.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Just by visiting that page,
you are taking on board

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.730 align:middle line:90%
a drive-by download.

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:42.250 align:middle line:84%
This can take the form of a rat,
a remote-access Trojan for--

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:43.700 align:middle line:90%
this is where it gets scary.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.000 align:middle line:84%
If somebody puts a
remote-access Trojan

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.590 align:middle line:84%
into your phone or your
laptop or whatever,

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:51.052 align:middle line:84%
they can screw
with you massively.

00:25:51.052 --> 00:25:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that where this
other thing comes in you

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.470 align:middle line:90%
talked about in your Ted Talk?

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:55.030 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:56.405 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK,
we'll go into that.

00:25:56.405 --> 00:26:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Like, for example,
I mean, things they can do--

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.830 align:middle line:84%
next time you go to
PayPal and you type

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:05.180 align:middle line:84%
in your PayPal
password, they see it.

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.500 align:middle line:90%
They can empty that account.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.260 align:middle line:84%
Next time you go to
your bank account

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.540 align:middle line:84%
and you put in
your details, they

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:12.650 align:middle line:90%
can mimic that for themselves.

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.270 align:middle line:84%
They can empty
your bank account.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Then there's other people that
do it just for sick kicks.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.590 align:middle line:84%
People have rat
slaves, for example.

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.470 align:middle line:90%
What's a rat slave?

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.050 align:middle line:90%
You get inside their--

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:28.320 align:middle line:84%
let's say their
laptop, for example,

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.330 align:middle line:84%
and you might want to
screw with their head.

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And next time they
open their laptop,

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.190 align:middle line:90%
all the icons have moved.

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:35.728 align:middle line:90%
Why has that happened?

00:26:35.728 --> 00:26:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And why, in the
middle of the night,

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:42.210 align:middle line:84%
can I hear a baby screaming
over and over and over again?

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:43.860 align:middle line:84%
This is someone
playing with your head.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:44.660 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're just
doing-- pranksters.

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:46.040 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Just--

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Hackers
doing it for kicks.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Some spotty kid
somewhere maybe 1,000 miles

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:52.040 align:middle line:84%
away, sucking on a
Coke and eating pizza.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
doing that for fun.

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And then they posted these
things online, on the dark web.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.620 align:middle line:84%
And then you can see these rat
slaves pulling their hair out

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.980 align:middle line:84%
because all their money's gone,
or because, like, there's--

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:08.450 align:middle line:84%
they've gone to using
AI image generation,

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:09.810 align:middle line:90%
and they've got you naked.

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, this
is a big one now.

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And we're
going to send this

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.897 align:middle line:84%
to your friends and
family because we've

00:27:13.897 --> 00:27:15.120 align:middle line:90%
got your contacts book.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And unless you send us X in
Bitcoin, and that's not easy--

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.720 align:middle line:84%
but unless you send us X in
Bitcoin by this time Friday,

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.030 align:middle line:84%
we're going to post
it to everyone.

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:25.450 align:middle line:90%
How would that make people feel?

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:26.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's not even you naked.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:26.940 align:middle line:90%
It's AI.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But stuff Is
happening, and it's happening--

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.242 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: If you can think
of it, it's happening.

00:27:31.242 --> 00:27:33.685 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I was
listening to a report on--

00:27:33.685 --> 00:27:36.060 align:middle line:84%
I was on Spotify listening to
The Daily New York-- that's

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.660 align:middle line:84%
the New York Times Podcast,
talking about how often this

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:43.050 align:middle line:84%
is happening in high school,
where these boys are creating

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:45.930 align:middle line:84%
AI-generated faces on the
girls they're taking pictures

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:50.070 align:middle line:84%
of, I mean, bodies on them, and
sending the stuff around schools

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:51.650 align:middle line:90%
and just ruining girls' lives.

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: This is happening
all over the world.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.855 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: I'm living in
France at the moment.

00:27:55.855 --> 00:27:58.380 align:middle line:84%
There's been a big court
case with some young kids

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:02.850 align:middle line:84%
over the age of about 13
or 14, took the headshots

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:04.210 align:middle line:90%
of all the girls in the class.

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:05.010 align:middle line:90%
And they--

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Put new
bodies on them.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: --run it through
an AI image generator

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:10.090 align:middle line:84%
and then post it
amongst themselves.

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And these girls are
just having breakdowns.

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And they can't
tell their parents.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:15.908 align:middle line:90%
They can't tell anyone.

00:28:15.908 --> 00:28:17.200 align:middle line:90%
And the kids, what do they get?

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.280 align:middle line:90%
They just get ticked off.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.700 align:middle line:84%
They don't get fined or
sent to prison or anything.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:21.890 align:middle line:90%
They just get ticked off.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They might have
to miss a day of school.

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:25.550 align:middle line:84%
The high school case,
the girls are trapped.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:26.570 align:middle line:90%
They're devastated.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And the boys get a
suspension of a day.

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Yeah,
something like that.

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:30.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Something like that.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.375 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: But meanwhile,
your life is ruined.

00:28:32.375 --> 00:28:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And you won't go online
again or do anything again

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.840 align:middle line:84%
like that, because you're
now scared stiff to go out

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.582 align:middle line:90%
in the world on a digital site.

00:28:39.582 --> 00:28:40.382 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:40.382 --> 00:28:42.980 align:middle line:84%
So let's continue
with the rat thing,

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:45.500 align:middle line:84%
because there are other things
that they've been able to do,

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.470 align:middle line:84%
which can take your
life into even more

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:51.070 align:middle line:84%
serious consequences for
just a small amount of money.

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:53.520 align:middle line:84%
First of all, where are a lot
of these rat farms located?

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.320 align:middle line:90%
Do we know?

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:54.945 align:middle line:90%
Are they everywhere?

00:28:54.945 --> 00:28:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: No.

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:57.050 align:middle line:90%
it's very hard to say.

00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:00.650 align:middle line:84%
There are odd facilities
in places like Syria,

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:03.950 align:middle line:84%
for example, that are
protected by private militia.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, no one can get
into those facilities.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.300 align:middle line:90%
They can't hack into them.

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.015 align:middle line:84%
They can't send
us, I don't know,

00:29:10.015 --> 00:29:11.460 align:middle line:84%
SEAL Team Six or
something there.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: These are rat farms?

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:14.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: But they're
doing everything there.

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everything, yeah.

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Everything
you can think of.

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:17.600 align:middle line:90%
They're data mining.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.300 align:middle line:84%
They're doing all
sorts, and they're

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.400 align:middle line:84%
operating inside dodgy countries
where, really, the rule of law

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.670 align:middle line:90%
is just not applied.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.850 align:middle line:90%
So you're up against so much.

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:30.590 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to advocate
is don't do the things

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:32.220 align:middle line:90%
that draw their attention.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.413 align:middle line:84%
And if you get their
attention, these

00:29:34.413 --> 00:29:37.080 align:middle line:84%
are some of the things you might
be able to do to get out of it.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.638 align:middle line:84%
But once they've got hold
of you, it's not easy.

00:29:39.638 --> 00:29:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, one of the
things you talked about, too

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:44.600 align:middle line:84%
is, for example, one of
the really malicious things

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.180 align:middle line:84%
is, once a rat has gotten
into your computer,

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.430 align:middle line:84%
to be able to place on your
desktop child pornography,

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:51.230 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:53.063 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: This is the
most horrifying thing.

00:29:53.063 --> 00:29:54.480 align:middle line:90%
Can you think of anything worse?

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.060 align:middle line:84%
So I've had this happen to
me, not actually put in.

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.580 align:middle line:84%
But when I was
working as a journo,

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:03.050 align:middle line:84%
and I was quizzing someone,
he said to me, right now

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:05.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm putting kiddie
porn in your computer.

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:07.840 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't, but you know--

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: So this--

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And they do.

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.830 align:middle line:90%
They can--

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Oh, they do.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.020 align:middle line:90%
I know they do.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:15.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Israeli Mossad
will do this to journalists,

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:17.150 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If they question
the narrative or whatever.

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:23.380 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Journalists question
Israel's motives in cases,

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.230 align:middle line:84%
for example, are
opening themselves

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:27.280 align:middle line:90%
to a wealth of problems.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.010 align:middle line:84%
They will destroy your
life if they choose to,

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:31.968 align:middle line:84%
and a good way is images
of child sexual abuse.

00:30:31.968 --> 00:30:34.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then they
report it to authorities,

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:35.760 align:middle line:84%
and authorities look
at your computer.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.820 align:middle line:90%
And then you're in jail.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And
what's your defense?

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I wrote an article
about Gaza or something.

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, pull the other one.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Whoa.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So as--

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: But you can
pay someone to do that.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Let's supposing someone
really screws with me,

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.542 align:middle line:90%
someone I really hate.

00:30:52.542 --> 00:30:56.790 align:middle line:84%
I would then pay $500, $600
to someone on the dark web

00:30:56.790 --> 00:31:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and have them load images
of child sexual abuse

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.625 align:middle line:84%
onto their computer and
then tip off the police,

00:31:03.625 --> 00:31:04.750 align:middle line:90%
and their lives are ruined.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:07.600 align:middle line:84%
You'll never recover from that--
never, ever recover from that.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How can
you explain it?

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.402 align:middle line:90%
Well, it wasn't there.

00:31:09.402 --> 00:31:10.360 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't there before.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.550 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't there yesterday.

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:12.490 align:middle line:90%
You can't explain it.

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And if
you were doing it,

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:15.357 align:middle line:84%
you'd say exactly the
same thing anyway.

00:31:15.357 --> 00:31:17.310 align:middle line:84%
So you're never
going to be believed.

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is so easy, and
there's different levels

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.720 align:middle line:84%
set for $5, $10,
$20 or something,

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:26.150 align:middle line:84%
you can do strange things, like
completely screw all their--

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.820 align:middle line:84%
in fact, let's say that someone
would get into your Facebook

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:32.210 align:middle line:84%
page, completely modify
your Facebook page,

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:35.610 align:middle line:84%
and then change the password
so you can't get back in there.

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:40.460 align:middle line:84%
So for example, they might post
terrible things about your boss

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:42.650 align:middle line:84%
as if it was you saying
things about your boss

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:43.940 align:middle line:90%
to get you to lose your job.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:47.840 align:middle line:84%
[SCOFFS] Few hundred
dollars for that, nothing.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And you can't now then go back
on Facebook and change it.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And you want to contact
the Facebook people

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:54.967 align:middle line:90%
and say, hey, this has happened.

00:31:54.967 --> 00:31:56.300 align:middle line:90%
You're never going to hear back.

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:57.390 align:middle line:90%
You'll never hear back.

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:00.148 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: This is how
you can screw with people

00:32:00.148 --> 00:32:01.197 align:middle line:90%
in the modern world.

00:32:01.197 --> 00:32:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just, the whole
thing sounds like a rat's nest,

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:04.670 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: It makes me feel
physically sick, I mean,

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:08.310 align:middle line:90%
really physically sick.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you go
onto the dark web--

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.633 align:middle line:84%
and you need a special
browser, and you

00:32:12.633 --> 00:32:15.050 align:middle line:84%
should be using a virtual
private network and all the rest

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:16.880 align:middle line:84%
of it-- once you're
on there, you're

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.453 align:middle line:90%
into a very, very strange world.

00:32:19.453 --> 00:32:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But your
whole thing now

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:24.860 align:middle line:84%
is to explain to people how they
can co-opt that strange world

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.790 align:middle line:90%
to protect themselves.

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, I've taken
the best of the dark arts,

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:30.770 align:middle line:90%
as it were.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And I've turned them
to the power of good.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.320 align:middle line:84%
So as I was saying
at the beginning,

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.930 align:middle line:84%
a journalist could
use steganography

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:39.240 align:middle line:84%
to hide photographs, but just
to communicate with somebody.

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:40.957 align:middle line:90%
How would you do that?

00:32:40.957 --> 00:32:42.323 align:middle line:90%
How would we have secure email--

00:32:42.323 --> 00:32:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Well, there's no--

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --outside of WhatsApp?

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: I wouldn't
even use secure email.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
I'm saying email.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:50.370 align:middle line:84%
How can we communicate
outside of WhatsApp?

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Let's supposing
you lived in a small village,

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:58.560 align:middle line:84%
and some corporation wanted
to frack in your area.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And you wanted to
create a little group

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.580 align:middle line:84%
to combat the fracking
because you didn't like it.

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.513 align:middle line:84%
The people working for
that fracking company

00:33:06.513 --> 00:33:08.430 align:middle line:84%
would be well aware of
everything you're doing

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:10.835 align:middle line:84%
and will do everything they
can to thwart your efforts.

00:33:10.835 --> 00:33:11.635 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:11.635 --> 00:33:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: I can
show you very easily

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:17.850 align:middle line:84%
how to set up methods
of communication

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:20.080 align:middle line:84%
where no one can
intercept it in transit.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.720 align:middle line:90%
Here's easy.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:26.490 align:middle line:90%
Open an email account at Google.

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Share the login
details privately

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.690 align:middle line:90%
by word of mouth with people.

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Using the anonymous browser
on your phone or whatever--

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:39.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like incognito.

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:43.680 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: You go to the
Google web mail page,

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:47.440 align:middle line:84%
and the message is
awaiting you in the drafts.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not being posted.

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.510 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be intercepted,
because it's not gone anywhere.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:54.180 align:middle line:84%
It's just sitting there
in a tiny little corner

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:55.110 align:middle line:90%
of the internet.

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:58.807 align:middle line:84%
And everybody just reads the
draft or posts in drafts.

00:33:58.807 --> 00:33:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.495 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So these
are the things

00:34:01.495 --> 00:34:03.790 align:middle line:84%
you were writing about in
your Sherlock Holmes guide.

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And that's not
even complicated, is it?

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:06.190 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can do that.

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:08.909 align:middle line:84%
So the corporation is going
to monitor your emails

00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:11.110 align:middle line:84%
because they can, and
they're going to miss that.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:12.719 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
miss that entirely.

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:12.969 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:13.769 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:13.769 --> 00:34:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And what I tend to
teach is a form of spycraft.

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:20.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not so much digital, but
you're using the digital tools.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a game of cat and mouse.

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:25.330 align:middle line:84%
It's outfoxing somebody or
being one step ahead of.

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And whatever you're doing
and it's working, change it.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:29.300 align:middle line:90%
Do something else.

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.100 align:middle line:90%
Change it.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:32.659 align:middle line:84%
Don't let them get a grip
on what you're doing.

00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:34.203 align:middle line:90%
Stay one step ahead of them.

00:34:34.203 --> 00:34:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
happens when you

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:39.909 align:middle line:84%
have a whole string of passwords
for bank accounts, everything

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:41.659 align:middle line:90%
else, but they're all the same?

00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:47.659 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: OK, I keep a
basic, simple password,

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:48.949 align:middle line:90%
just a really simple one.

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I tack on
to the end of it.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Let's supposing it was--

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:56.090 align:middle line:90%
and in my bank account.

00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:56.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Right.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:00.280 align:middle line:84%
So I might have Bonfire
of the Vanities, which

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.390 align:middle line:90%
is about bankers.

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:07.240 align:middle line:84%
So I might take the first line
from Bonfire of the Vanities

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.940 align:middle line:90%
and take the initial letter.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I just remember
what those letters are,

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.880 align:middle line:84%
and I tack that onto
my regular password.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.720 align:middle line:84%
No one's going to
guess what that is.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Sometimes, if
I didn't want people to--

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:23.150 align:middle line:84%
because they will run
a computer through

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:24.830 align:middle line:84%
every possible
permutation of what

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:27.510 align:middle line:84%
your password might be until
they eventually might crack it.

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:31.532 align:middle line:84%
I use symbols, like smiley faces
and stuff instead of words.

00:35:31.532 --> 00:35:33.240 align:middle line:84%
They're not necessarily
looking for that.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.657 align:middle line:84%
Use odd symbols
that they're never

00:35:34.657 --> 00:35:36.390 align:middle line:84%
going to use as a
matter of course,

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:39.727 align:middle line:84%
like the British pound symbol or
the euro and things like that.

00:35:39.727 --> 00:35:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good idea.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: As a matter of
course, they won't automatically

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:43.230 align:middle line:90%
go for that.

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:45.547 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And that will
keep people out of it.

00:35:45.547 --> 00:35:48.930 align:middle line:84%
But never, ever, ever use the
same password for everything.

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:51.875 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to teach people to--

00:35:51.875 --> 00:35:54.870 align:middle line:84%
here's a way to share a
password with someone.

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:58.280 align:middle line:84%
So you say Jane Austen's
Pride and Prejudice.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.940 align:middle line:90%
Well, the first line of--

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:03.360 align:middle line:84%
I've actually
never forgotten it.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:08.120 align:middle line:84%
But all you need to do is
open Pride and Prejudice

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.645 align:middle line:90%
on Amazon Books--

00:36:09.645 --> 00:36:11.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Look at
the first line.

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: --look
at the first line.

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Take the initial letter
from every one of those.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.350 align:middle line:90%
That's your password.

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:18.280 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: So you just
have to say "pride."

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Basic spy craft.

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So with the
government's agencies,

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:28.270 align:middle line:84%
like our NSA or CIA
or MI6 or whatever,

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:32.140 align:middle line:84%
are they all able to dive to
the bottom of the deep web?

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:33.330 align:middle line:90%
Do they have access?

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:34.788 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: They kind
of invented it,

00:36:34.788 --> 00:36:36.100 align:middle line:90%
to say the US Navy began this.

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they're using it
all the time anyway.

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they can keep
their eye on what's going on?

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:41.367 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, they're
using it anyway.

00:36:41.367 --> 00:36:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Embassies are using
it to communicate back

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:45.880 align:middle line:84%
to the home country,
and so on and so forth,

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.360 align:middle line:90%
and not have things intercepted.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Because the internet is
so huge, and the dark web

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:56.590 align:middle line:84%
and all the rest of it, forget
hiding a needle in a haystack.

00:36:56.590 --> 00:37:00.160 align:middle line:84%
You're hiding a needle in
a universe of haystacks.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And without prior knowledge,
you will never find it,

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.290 align:middle line:90%
without prior knowledge.

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:08.280 align:middle line:84%
So if you've got a group and
you're opposed to fracking,

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.810 align:middle line:84%
you minimize any
communication online,

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:15.640 align:middle line:84%
except perhaps using this
box, the draft Google Mail.

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And then change it
to Yahoo, and then

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:18.770 align:middle line:90%
change it to something else.

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And keep staying one
step ahead of people.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you were seriously
into doing something

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:27.850 align:middle line:84%
and you didn't want
people to monitor you,

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:30.660 align:middle line:84%
get a really crappy
kind of old phone.

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Right?

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:32.265 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:37:32.265 --> 00:37:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or burners.

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And put
talking code in text.

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.290 align:middle line:84%
They can't monitor
those so readily.

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:40.240 align:middle line:90%


00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Most people will say, well,
I have nothing to hide.

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:43.460 align:middle line:90%
What difference does it make?

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:44.377 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah, right.

00:37:44.377 --> 00:37:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is a bit like
quoting the Nazis because Joseph

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Goebbels coined the phrase
"if you have nothing to hide,

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:53.363 align:middle line:84%
you have nothing to fear"
when he founded the Gestapo.

00:37:53.363 --> 00:37:54.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.655 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Now, so
I don't like it

00:37:55.655 --> 00:37:58.185 align:middle line:84%
when people quote the Nazis
in terms of personal security.

00:37:58.185 --> 00:37:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's
most people say.

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: That's
what most people say.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.300 align:middle line:84%
But then you look at
corporations or crooks

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:05.410 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:07.535 align:middle line:84%
It's not about having to
hide things because you're

00:38:07.535 --> 00:38:08.790 align:middle line:90%
up to no good yourself.

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:11.683 align:middle line:84%
If you were a journalist,
and you're trying to find,

00:38:11.683 --> 00:38:13.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, a
corporation that's

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:16.530 align:middle line:84%
poisoning rivers or something,
that's a good thing.

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And you're using these dark
arts for that power of good,

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:21.960 align:middle line:90%
then use them.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:22.760 align:middle line:90%
Use them.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And I will show you every
way I have discovered,

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:26.808 align:middle line:84%
and I've discovered
them from a--

00:38:26.808 --> 00:38:28.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In a
Sherlock Holmes story.

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, yeah, that's why
I put them in a Sherlock Holmes

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.610 align:middle line:84%
story, because no one's
going to sit and read

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:32.820 align:middle line:90%
a cybersecurity handbook.

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:33.653 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:38:33.653 --> 00:38:35.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I have a
question for you.

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:38.990 align:middle line:84%
We have these events that
take place all the time.

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Of course, depending
on the community

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:44.360 align:middle line:84%
that you are logged
in with, some people

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:47.637 align:middle line:84%
can say false flags, attacks,
Manchurian candidates,

00:38:47.637 --> 00:38:48.470 align:middle line:90%
and all of the like.

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:52.430 align:middle line:84%
So we have people who commit
these larger crimes and attempt

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:57.620 align:middle line:84%
not that long ago on Donald
Trump's life and many others.

00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, people get confused
because people now don't trust

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.470 align:middle line:90%
anybody or anything they say.

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:06.600 align:middle line:90%
Now that was a setup.

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:11.460 align:middle line:84%
But the question is whether it
was a setup or wasn't a setup.

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:14.290 align:middle line:10%
Are the people that do
these kinds of crimes,

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:15.820 align:middle line:10%
then they write
about their history,

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:20.770 align:middle line:10%
a 20-year-old who belongs to
a gun club, versus terrorists,

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:23.260 align:middle line:10%
deep, deep terrorists
and, say, the Mossad,

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:27.760 align:middle line:10%
which has agents embedded in
every terrorist organization,

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.140 align:middle line:10%
including Hamas, to the hilt--

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:30.970 align:middle line:10%
>>PEARCE: Because they'd be
foolish that they didn't.

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so yeah,
they've got agents everywhere.

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.845 align:middle line:90%
They know what's going on.

00:39:36.845 --> 00:39:39.220 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: They don't need to
monitor us as a consequence.

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:39.540 align:middle line:90%
They do--

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm asking you.

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: No, they do not.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.060 align:middle line:84%
They're doing it
for other reasons.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:45.460 align:middle line:90%
They want to know all sorts.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.877 align:middle line:84%
They just want to
know what you're

00:39:46.877 --> 00:39:48.330 align:middle line:90%
thinking on a basic level.

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Because next time they're
having an election, they can--

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.730 align:middle line:84%
their prospectus
for their election,

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:58.230 align:middle line:84%
they can target it to suit what
people are thinking because they

00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:59.530 align:middle line:90%
know their deeper thoughts.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:39:59.980 align:middle line:90%
Well I'm sorry--

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And their fears.

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: --over my shoulder.

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:01.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't like it.

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:03.750 align:middle line:84%
They know their
fears, and that's

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:06.340 align:middle line:84%
how you're going to manipulate
the masses, because they then

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:08.120 align:middle line:84%
control the media
in all countries,

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.150 align:middle line:84%
not just this
country, all medias.

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:11.920 align:middle line:84%
The intelligence
controls the media.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And if anybody doesn't think
so, they need to study--

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.453 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: As a journalist
in the field, when

00:40:16.453 --> 00:40:19.270 align:middle line:84%
you bump into another
journalist, mostly for me

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:21.078 align:middle line:84%
because I'm skeptical,
first thought

00:40:21.078 --> 00:40:22.120 align:middle line:90%
is, is that a journalist?

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Or are they working
for an agency?

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:25.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: A very good friend
of mine, a photographer that I

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:30.910 align:middle line:84%
worked with for
years, turned out

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:34.810 align:middle line:84%
to be feeding
information to the Brits,

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:39.610 align:middle line:84%
not as a spy or anything,
but as a sideline,

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:42.740 align:middle line:84%
found out because we got caught
doing something together.

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:47.500 align:middle line:84%
We caught the Thai soldiers
about to massacre some refugees.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:50.560 align:middle line:84%
His sources told us
to leave the country

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:52.940 align:middle line:84%
because we were being charged,
and that's how we found--

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:53.830 align:middle line:90%
I found out--

00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That he was
a plant, more or less.

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you have the
lone shooter story, in general,

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:04.130 align:middle line:84%
we're reading our headlines, oh,
19-year-old, 22-year-old male,

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:05.930 align:middle line:90%
mentally disturbed.

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Just your general
thought on this.

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Are they generally
lone agent people

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.510 align:middle line:84%
that do this that you couldn't
have monitored them per se?

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:13.890 align:middle line:90%
They're not really that deep.

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:16.432 align:middle line:90%
Or are they something more?

00:41:16.432 --> 00:41:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Oftentimes, though,
you will go back and you will

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:21.240 align:middle line:84%
see they've posted all
sorts of crazy stuff--

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.950 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of crazy stuff.

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:24.120 align:middle line:90%
But what do you do?

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.890 align:middle line:90%
You then, you're into precrime.

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:27.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like a Philip K.
Dick novel of something.

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Minority Report, yeah?

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:32.720 align:middle line:84%
So what, you arrest
people for precrime?

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:33.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they were doing it
just because they were angry

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:37.260 align:middle line:90%
one day.

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: That's it.

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:40.040 align:middle line:84%
But they had no intention
of killing anyone.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the ones
who do the real terrorism,

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:44.110 align:middle line:84%
the one who manipulate
governments--

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:44.660 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: You won't find them.

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're not
going to ever find them.

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:47.820 align:middle line:84%
They are at the base
of the deep web.

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:49.528 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And many
times they're not even

00:41:49.528 --> 00:41:51.510 align:middle line:90%
using that technology at all.

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:54.740 align:middle line:84%
They've gone back to original
spy craft of handwritten notes

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:59.480 align:middle line:84%
and suchlike, and codes, codes
based on a book, book code,

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.502 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:42:00.502 --> 00:42:01.585 align:middle line:90%
They use those techniques.

00:42:01.585 --> 00:42:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have you encountered
this sort of thing in your life?

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:04.457 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: No, because they--

00:42:04.457 --> 00:42:05.257 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:42:05.257 --> 00:42:07.424 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They would never
be encountered by someone

00:42:07.424 --> 00:42:08.420 align:middle line:90%
like you or anyone.

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.003 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: If you're
really doing that,

00:42:10.003 --> 00:42:13.040 align:middle line:84%
you're using some spycraft that
people were using the 1800s.

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:13.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they've
gone back to that.

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:15.850 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Yeah, and they're
not going to find you,

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:16.910 align:middle line:90%
because where they're looking?

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:17.960 align:middle line:90%
They're looking online.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.340 align:middle line:84%
They're looking in your
mom's email account.

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:22.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the ones that are
really screwing up this planet,

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:25.930 align:middle line:84%
really causing deep
societal disturbances,

00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:30.250 align:middle line:84%
creating wars, et cetera, those
are the ones that are never

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:31.790 align:middle line:90%
going to be gotten to anyway.

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:34.450 align:middle line:10%
And they're doing it often in
relationship to the governments

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:36.080 align:middle line:10%
and the intelligence agencies.

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Because many times,
there's somebody even stronger

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:38.780 align:middle line:90%
behind them.

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:39.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Take the
Russians and the Chinese.

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:43.450 align:middle line:84%
They're hacking left,
right, and center.

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:46.270 align:middle line:84%
In Britain, where I
come from, now hospitals

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:47.980 align:middle line:84%
are having these
ransomware attacks

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:49.720 align:middle line:90%
where they lock the computers.

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:52.133 align:middle line:84%
And you can't carry
out operations.

00:42:52.133 --> 00:42:53.300 align:middle line:90%
You can't book appointments.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:57.220 align:middle line:84%
You can't do anything unless
you pay millions of dollars

00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:59.770 align:middle line:84%
in Bitcoin to some
entity that's hiding

00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:03.050 align:middle line:84%
in Russia or China or
North Korea or wherever,

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and you're not going
to combat that.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is only
going to get worse, though.

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:08.055 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: You can
combat it by actually

00:43:08.055 --> 00:43:11.420 align:middle line:84%
putting some smart tech in your
computer in the first place.

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And you can train people not
to follow links willy-nilly.

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.130 align:middle line:90%
You get an email.

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:19.460 align:middle line:84%
You get an email purporting to
be from PayPal, for example.

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And it says, there's a
problem with your account.

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:23.810 align:middle line:90%
You need to reset your password.

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:24.610 align:middle line:90%
Click this button.

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:27.160 align:middle line:90%
Reset your password.

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.823 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] Well, don't.

00:43:28.823 --> 00:43:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Look at the email address
that it's come from.

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.532 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Always look
at the email address.

00:43:32.532 --> 00:43:35.221 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Because it
may say, PayPal 7238.

00:43:35.221 --> 00:43:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Dot IA or
dot whatever, yeah.

00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: There's nothing
like that in PayPal.

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:39.320 align:middle line:90%
So don't follow it.

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.765 align:middle line:84%
And then go and put your
cursor over any links.

00:43:41.765 --> 00:43:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, the link
address will come up.

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:45.100 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't say paypal.com.

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:45.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Anywhere.

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:46.512 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Don't go there.

00:43:46.512 --> 00:43:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So maybe a career for
up and coming computer techies

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:54.460 align:middle line:84%
is really, cybersecurity sounds
like that's where it's at across

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:58.325 align:middle line:84%
the board, every level of
cybersecurity, from grandma to--

00:43:58.325 --> 00:44:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: I wouldn't want to be
in that level of cybersecurity,

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:02.700 align:middle line:84%
because it's such a
game of cat and mouse.

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.820 align:middle line:90%
It's constantly changing.

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Someone is already one step
ahead of you the whole time,

00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:08.780 align:middle line:90%
and you're playing catch-up.

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:09.530 align:middle line:90%
And then you're going to get--

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:10.822 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sounded like an idea.

00:44:10.822 --> 00:44:12.710 align:middle line:90%
What about DuckDuckGo?

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: DotDotGo?

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:14.385 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: DuckDuckGo.

00:44:14.385 --> 00:44:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: Oh, DuckDuckGo.

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:16.520 align:middle line:90%
I like DuckDuckGo.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
that's what I use.

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: I like it mostly
because I like the name.

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:20.823 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's cute.

00:44:20.823 --> 00:44:23.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: But it's a browser,
for those that don't know,

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:27.308 align:middle line:84%
that when you close that
browser down, boom, everything--

00:44:27.308 --> 00:44:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like incognito.

00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Just like incognito,
but slightly more sophisticated.

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:34.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: And the search
facility is particularly good.

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Supposing you're
a budding author,

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:39.332 align:middle line:84%
and you want to write a
novel about a terrorist.

00:44:39.332 --> 00:44:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And you want to know
how to build a bomb.

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you don't
want to be arrested.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:42.180 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:42.980 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: No.

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:46.670 align:middle line:84%
If you start researching "how
do I build a bomb" on Google,

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:49.800 align:middle line:90%
someone will find out about it.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.860 align:middle line:84%
You might never know,
but you might never

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:53.760 align:middle line:90%
be able to get on a plane again.

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you can't
access your bank account.

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.800 align:middle line:90%
So this happens a lot.

00:44:58.800 --> 00:44:59.825 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:59.825 --> 00:45:01.180 align:middle line:90%
OK, so that's good.

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:02.410 align:middle line:90%
So we've got incognito.

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:03.580 align:middle line:90%
We've got DuckDuckGo.

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Those are a couple of easy
ones anybody can access.

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And then as far as any
of the deeper, darker web

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:12.390 align:middle line:84%
stuff, we probably,
as individuals,

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:14.890 align:middle line:84%
don't need to go as deeply
as you went into it.

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:17.015 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: What I would
recommend, though, is people

00:45:17.015 --> 00:45:18.667 align:middle line:84%
get a Virtual Private
Network, a VPN.

00:45:18.667 --> 00:45:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, a VPN.

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: They're
largely inexpensive.

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And people then don't know where
you are, for example, which is--

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They can't tell
where you are location-wise.

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:30.370 align:middle line:90%
>>PEARCE: No.

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a good idea.

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:32.495 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: So just
supposing I was

00:45:32.495 --> 00:45:36.310 align:middle line:84%
researching how to build a
bomb for a novel I was writing.

00:45:36.310 --> 00:45:38.110 align:middle line:90%
I would have a VPN.

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:41.460 align:middle line:84%
I'd set it up somewhere
as if I was in Ukraine.

00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:45.220 align:middle line:90%
I would use maybe DuckDuckGo.

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:47.680 align:middle line:10%
Or if I really
wanted to go deeper,

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:51.570 align:middle line:10%
I would use the Tor browser,
T-O-R, stands for The Onion

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:53.440 align:middle line:10%
Router, freely downloadable.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.880 align:middle line:10%
That puts you in the dark web.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:55.680 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:58.610 align:middle line:10%
>>PEARCE: Right, and then what
with the VPN, what with that,

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:01.780 align:middle line:10%
and you're bouncing off other
people all around the planet,

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:04.330 align:middle line:10%
they never trace you back,
unless you're foolish

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:05.930 align:middle line:10%
and you stay on there too long.

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe your VPN
dies because there's

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:10.130 align:middle line:84%
an interruption on the
power supply or something.

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Keep moving.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:11.570 align:middle line:90%
Keep moving.

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:11.990 align:middle line:90%
Keep moving.

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So all
this is in your book.

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:14.830 align:middle line:10%
>>PEARCE: All of
this is in the book,

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:16.538 align:middle line:10%
in the Sherlock Holmes
one because that's

00:46:16.538 --> 00:46:17.755 align:middle line:10%
what they're up against.

00:46:17.755 --> 00:46:19.880 align:middle line:10%
And there's other terrible
things that will happen.

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:21.617 align:middle line:10%
I talked to Rathik.

00:46:21.617 --> 00:46:23.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you want me to
tell you more horrible things?

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:24.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.825 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's to do that
in a second conversation

00:46:26.825 --> 00:46:28.880 align:middle line:84%
because we're out of
time, I'm sorry to say.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:29.900 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Well, we
could talk forever.

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We could
talk forever, and I

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:33.320 align:middle line:84%
am so grateful for what
you've already told us.

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:36.080 align:middle line:84%
So we will pick this
conversation up again later.

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:37.610 align:middle line:90%
Alan, thank you so much.

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:39.780 align:middle line:90%
Scary but necessary talk.

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>PEARCE: Regina, thank
you for having me.

00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:43.113 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Again, the
title of the book

00:46:43.113 --> 00:46:45.860 align:middle line:84%
is The Sherlock Holmes
Handbook for the Digital Age.

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Let's thank Alan for taking
the blinders off our eyes.

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:56.070 align:middle line:90%
