>>REGINA MEREDITH: After
decades of suppression

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.010 align:middle line:10%
and criminalization that
has ruined countless lives,

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.570 align:middle line:10%
some of nature's
more potent agents

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.470 align:middle line:10%
are finally being vindicated.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Marijuana's active
ingredients are

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.260 align:middle line:84%
being credited with reversing
everything from depression

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.240 align:middle line:90%
and dementia to cancer.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.620 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca is in clinical
trials to treat depression.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Magic mushrooms, or
psilocybin, may finally

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.470 align:middle line:84%
be taking its rightful
place as a partner

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.500 align:middle line:84%
in the opening of
intelligence to all of nature,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.050 align:middle line:84%
including its potential
therapeutic use for OCD.

Simon G. Powell is
with us today to speak

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.349 align:middle line:84%
about his lifelong devotion
to understanding psilocybin.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:05.560 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're just
kind of on a tear,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.530 align:middle line:84%
doing a media tear,
live TV and all this.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.195 align:middle line:84%
So take a breath,
calm your nerves.

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:12.195 align:middle line:90%
>>SIMON G. POWELL: Yeah.

00:01:12.195 --> 00:01:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, thanks for
inviting me here.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.060 align:middle line:90%
It's very kind of you.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, this
is really interesting.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.045 align:middle line:84%
It's something that's
not written about

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:20.140 align:middle line:84%
as often as-- I've known
about your work for quite

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.242 align:middle line:90%
a long time.

00:01:21.242 --> 00:01:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And because you
live in England, we

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.530 align:middle line:84%
haven't been able to
get to you until now.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's something
that has in the past

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.760 align:middle line:84%
been really struck down
as irrelevant, dangerous,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.970 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.745 align:middle line:84%
And as we start
looking at it, we're

00:01:34.745 --> 00:01:38.437 align:middle line:84%
thinking, like I said in a
moment ago to the camera,

00:01:38.437 --> 00:01:40.020 align:middle line:84%
all these things are
being vindicated,

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.240 align:middle line:84%
because they are part
of an intelligent aspect

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.570 align:middle line:90%
of our world.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.410 align:middle line:10%
>>POWELL: Yeah, well, the
interesting-- yeah, psilocybin,

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.500 align:middle line:10%
these magic mushrooms,
unfortunately they're

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.480 align:middle line:10%
almost like a taboo subject.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.730 align:middle line:10%
It's quite difficult
to talk about.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.920 align:middle line:10%
And there are
negative associations.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.350 align:middle line:10%
People think, oh, it's drugs
and this kind of thing.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.210 align:middle line:90%
And they are in this country.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.180 align:middle line:84%
They're classified
as Schedule 1.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So, psilocybin, this
substance I'm interested in,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.020 align:middle line:84%
is classified as
Schedule 1, which

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.690 align:middle line:84%
means it's deemed to be one of
the most dangerous substances

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.350 align:middle line:84%
known to man with no
medical application

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.200 align:middle line:90%
and extremely harmful.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.810 align:middle line:84%
It's not true, and it needs to
be known that it's not true.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:84%
The evidence, particularly
now, the scientific evidence

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.370 align:middle line:84%
is building up, and it really
needs to be rescheduled.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.946 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: But yeah, I'm happy
to talk about it, basically

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.300 align:middle line:84%
because of the experiences
I've had over the last 25 users

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.280 align:middle line:84%
or so have been so
positive and so incredible

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.330 align:middle line:84%
that you can't keep it bottled
up, the information about this.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:90%
Because it's a natural resource.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.434 align:middle line:84%
We suffer from nature
deficit disorder, right?

00:02:55.434 --> 00:02:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, right, we do.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: We all live
in cities, and we're

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.250 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by man-made
architecture, man-made ideas,

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.330 align:middle line:90%
and this kind of thing.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And we suffer from
nature deficit disorder

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.390 align:middle line:84%
now and this terrible
ecological disconnection

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.400 align:middle line:84%
from the rest of the planet,
the rest of the biosphere.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And we're pushing the
biosphere to breaking point.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.900 align:middle line:84%
So we need to get
back to nature,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and we need to address this
nature deficit disorder.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing about
psilocybin mushrooms is for me,

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.935 align:middle line:90%
they're like a living symbol.

00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:29.900 align:middle line:84%
A mushroom is a
symbol of the Earth.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.230 align:middle line:90%
It comes out of the ground.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Earthiest
of all its produce.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yeah, and through
psilocybin, if you're lucky,

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.740 align:middle line:84%
you can have this kind of
a communion with nature.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:84%
I know of no better way
of communing with nature

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.780 align:middle line:84%
and feeling great love for
the biosphere, if you like,

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.730 align:middle line:90%
than with the use of--

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Imbibing her bounty.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: Yes, exactly.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's free.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.690 align:middle line:90%
This is the thing.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.300 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's an aspect of
the wilderness, if you like,

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.260 align:middle line:90%
that's still out there.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a wild thing.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:02.640 align:middle line:90%
It's uncontrolled.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not a bad thing, and it's
there, and it's a resource.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's a resource that I
think we need to look at.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And thankfully, science,
there's a resurgence

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.480 align:middle line:84%
in psychedelic science
now, and scientists

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.400 align:middle line:84%
are looking into the various
therapeutic applications

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.899 align:middle line:84%
of psilocybin and
how psilocybin can

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:24.395 align:middle line:84%
be used to treat obsessive
compulsive disorder, as you

00:04:24.395 --> 00:04:28.050 align:middle line:84%
said, and addiction
and depression.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And they've used
it to great effect

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.920 align:middle line:84%
to relieve anxiety in people
suffering from end-stage cancer

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.050 align:middle line:90%
and this kind of thing.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.760 align:middle line:90%
So it's there.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a natural resource.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.050 align:middle line:90%
Is a powerful symbol.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm happy to, regardless
of the negative associations,

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.376 align:middle line:84%
I feel it's my duty
to talk about--

00:04:46.376 --> 00:04:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're
a pragmatist, too.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And what I like
about-- well, one thing

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.300 align:middle line:84%
is-- we were talking off camera
about this-- how in the world

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.680 align:middle line:84%
were you able to stay so
coherent in your writings

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:84%
while you were in the
middle of these experiences?

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.280 align:middle line:90%
We will get into that.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.140 align:middle line:84%
But I want to back up
a bit, because you've

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.320 align:middle line:84%
been an adventurer looking
to alter consciousness

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.900 align:middle line:84%
through nature and to
understand the nature of reality

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.760 align:middle line:84%
through natural substances
for quite a long time.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to go back
to one of your more-- mm--

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.420 align:middle line:84%
naive experiences when
you were quite young.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And it had to do-- we've
all heard that-- well, I've

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.560 align:middle line:84%
read that nutmeg can be an
aphrodisiac, for example,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.040 align:middle line:90%
and other things as well.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.215 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about your
early days' experience

00:05:31.215 --> 00:05:34.390 align:middle line:84%
with nutmeg just
to set the stage.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: If we must,
I can talk about that.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's too funny.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.970 align:middle line:90%
You've got to go there.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.844 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Well, no, it
was one of the first--

00:05:39.844 --> 00:05:43.100 align:middle line:84%
as I described in a new book,
this was a long time ago

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.370 align:middle line:84%
when I was a youth, and
you're exploring the world,

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.110 align:middle line:84%
and you're exploring
psychoactive substances.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And I read somewhere in a book
that nutmeg was psychoactive.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.594 align:middle line:84%
And it's readily available
in the local supermarket.

00:06:03.594 --> 00:06:05.010 align:middle line:84%
The woman there
must have wondered

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.730 align:middle line:90%
why we were buying lots of--

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were buying
up all those little bottles.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: But I don't
like to remember it,

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.420 align:middle line:84%
because it's such a foul taste
when you have to consumer--

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.417 align:middle line:84%
it's nice sprinkled
on, a little bit--

00:06:14.417 --> 00:06:15.875 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A little
on your custard.

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yes, a
little hint of nutmeg.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.692 align:middle line:84%
But you try-- to
absolutely not recommended.

00:06:20.692 --> 00:06:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How much were
you taking at one time,

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.499 align:middle line:90%
like a tablespoon?

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: A couple tablespoons.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's very
hard to get down.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.345 align:middle line:84%
And the effects were
horrible as well.

00:06:29.345 --> 00:06:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's talk
about what it felt like.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: It's good to learn.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.491 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn, make
mistakes in life in order

00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:36.116 align:middle line:90%
to find the right path.

00:06:36.116 --> 00:06:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You got
a stomach ache.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: We learned some
serious, nauseating lessons

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.340 align:middle line:90%
in that.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The question
is, did you ever get high?

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: Yeah, well, it works.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.390 align:middle line:90%
It's psychoactive.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.320 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't a pleasant
change in consciousness.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
had to basically take

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.597 align:middle line:90%
a bottle or two of it.

00:06:52.597 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: A couple--

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.045 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Big tablespoons.

00:06:54.045 --> 00:06:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Two or three
tablespoons of that.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
small bottle of it.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: But then after
that, I read about these fly

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.550 align:middle line:84%
agaric mushrooms,
Amanita muscaria,

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.730 align:middle line:84%
which is the red one
with the white spots you

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.270 align:middle line:90%
see in all the fairytales.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.840 align:middle line:84%
I locate and pay lots of Amanita
muscaria, fly agaric mushrooms.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.880 align:middle line:90%
I never got an effect.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.010 align:middle line:84%
I tried every kind of
way to prepare them.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, I have a question,
then, at this juncture.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because other
books have been written

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.190 align:middle line:84%
by other authors on mushrooms
in Christianity and so forth

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:26.950 align:middle line:84%
and mushroom depictions
throughout Christian artworks.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And they always depict
that particular one.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.490 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.448 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: I think that's
because-- whether they

00:07:32.448 --> 00:07:35.570 align:middle line:84%
are mushrooms in those
religious artworks,

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.580 align:middle line:84%
whether they're mushrooms or
not is a contentious issue.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Most historians will say
they're stylized trees.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.300 align:middle line:84%
But if you do find something
that's absolutely a fly agaric

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.420 align:middle line:84%
mushroom, that's because they
look the most interesting.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's what you
see illustrations

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.340 align:middle line:90%
for fairy stories.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.080 align:middle line:90%
It's the most noticeable.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.780 align:middle line:84%
If you're familiar
with nature, and you

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.120 align:middle line:90%
go for walks in the forests--

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you see a little
red thing with polka dots.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: The most familiar,
the most striking mushroom

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.570 align:middle line:84%
you will see is
undoubtedly the fly agaric,

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.330 align:middle line:84%
because it lends itself
to being an artwork.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.590 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean there's
some sort of secret thing going

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.960 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So for
you, there wasn't

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.430 align:middle line:84%
much to that when
you took those.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:15.100 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: No.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.590 align:middle line:84%
For me, it was the
wrong mushroom.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.940 align:middle line:84%
But then I soon learned
about psilocybin mushrooms.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very
prevalent species

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.615 align:middle line:84%
in the UK called
the liberty cap.

00:08:25.615 --> 00:08:27.890 align:middle line:84%
They grow in parts
of America as well.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, as soon as I
found them, then my life--

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.385 align:middle line:90%
that was it.

00:08:31.385 --> 00:08:34.429 align:middle line:84%
That was like striking
gold, alchemical gold.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:36.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, did you
know your mushrooms well?

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.158 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some people
are listening to this

00:08:38.158 --> 00:08:40.280 align:middle line:84%
in America thinking,
oh, my God, there's

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.890 align:middle line:84%
so many poisonous
mushrooms out there.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.967 align:middle line:84%
Did you study quite
a bit first so you

00:08:44.967 --> 00:08:46.800 align:middle line:84%
had some knowledge
before you went out there

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.245 align:middle line:90%
into Richmond Park?

00:08:48.245 --> 00:08:50.620 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Remember, this is
the days before the internet.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.620 align:middle line:84%
You're talking
about the late '80s.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.170 align:middle line:84%
There was no interweb
in those days.

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I mean,
did you get books, or--?

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.068 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: So, yeah,
those days, you

00:08:56.068 --> 00:08:57.992 align:middle line:90%
have to go to find information.

00:08:57.992 --> 00:08:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Go to your library.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.158 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Younger people
won't understand this.

00:09:01.158 --> 00:09:02.830 align:middle line:90%
They say, use the interweb.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:04.660 align:middle line:90%
What's this guy talking about?

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.700 align:middle line:90%
There was no internet.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.570 align:middle line:84%
So you'd find books or go to
independent bookshops, where

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.790 align:middle line:84%
they'd have like a
section on psychedelics

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.500 align:middle line:90%
or underground subculture stuff.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And you'd see
pictures, and there

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.352 align:middle line:84%
were booklets you could buy
and identification guides

00:09:19.352 --> 00:09:20.310 align:middle line:90%
and this kind of thing.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.400 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, I mean, I knew
what I was looking for.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.316 align:middle line:90%
I did all my research.

00:09:23.316 --> 00:09:26.220 align:middle line:84%
It took me a few years before
I found them, but seek and ye

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.130 align:middle line:90%
shall find.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I mean, what's
so lovely about it, I've always

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.480 align:middle line:84%
kind of admired about
mushroom hunters,

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.540 align:middle line:84%
is that you're going out into
a forest on a cool and balmy

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.060 align:middle line:90%
morning, moist air, fresh air.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.605 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what could be more
beautiful an experience?

00:09:41.605 --> 00:09:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: And even if
you don't find any,

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.870 align:middle line:90%
the fresh air will do you good.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's a great
thing, foraging.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.400 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.477 align:middle line:84%
Every autumn, most
autumns, I will go, usually

00:09:51.477 --> 00:09:52.310 align:middle line:90%
with a close friend.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.800 align:middle line:84%
We'll go out trekking around
Snowdonia or the Lake District,

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.265 align:middle line:84%
the great wilderness, last
remaining wilderness, like Lord

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:02.270 align:middle line:84%
of the Rings country,
really beautiful mountains

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.290 align:middle line:90%
and valleys.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:04.600 align:middle line:90%
And I love it.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.090 align:middle line:84%
You're looking for
this-- and it's always,

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.480 align:middle line:84%
when you do you find them,
it's like you're on the trail.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.160 align:middle line:90%
Ah, there's the trail.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.760 align:middle line:84%
You find them, and you're on
the trail of a heap or whatever,

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.490 align:middle line:90%
and it's just a great thing.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.060 align:middle line:90%
And is a tremendous thing.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.360 align:middle line:84%
I always think it's like
you couldn't invent a more

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.280 align:middle line:84%
profound, fantastic
scenario than the fact

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.140 align:middle line:84%
that these mushrooms are
out there in the wilderness,

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.607 align:middle line:84%
and if you look hard
enough, you can find them.

00:10:34.607 --> 00:10:35.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We need a movie.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:37.605 align:middle line:84%
We need a big
Hollywood movie, right?

00:10:37.605 --> 00:10:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: Yeah, yeah.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've lost
touch with all that.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:40.719 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We have.

00:10:40.719 --> 00:10:43.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just sounds like a
luscious experience in itself.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.490 align:middle line:84%
So now, you didn't initially
go to Snowdonia or the Lake

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:48.010 align:middle line:90%
District.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:50.800 align:middle line:84%
You went to Richmond
Park in London.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: And Hampstead Heath.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to
ask you of Hampstead Heath.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.680 align:middle line:90%
That's such a beautiful park.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yeah,
they're both beautiful.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
have them as well?

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:56.390 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: Yes.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.098 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:10:57.098 --> 00:11:00.140 align:middle line:84%
So let's say those urban parks--
you were in Richmond Park,

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:90%
and you finally scored.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.710 align:middle line:90%
You found a bunch of them.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And when you first took
them, you were bold.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Had you read what a
normal dosage should be?

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.480 align:middle line:90%
Or did you just have to--?

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yeah, I
ascertained what

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.350 align:middle line:84%
a common-- I think
I ate about 40 or so

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.440 align:middle line:90%
of these fresh liberty caps.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.350 align:middle line:84%
But as I describe
in the book, it

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.757 align:middle line:84%
began quite-- it
was quite scary.

00:11:25.757 --> 00:11:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, let's
talk about that.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.756 align:middle line:84%
Because we're
talking about people

00:11:28.756 --> 00:11:32.610 align:middle line:84%
who-- most people watching this
may not have ever tried them.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to know what
that journey looks like.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.520 align:middle line:90%
You went bold, brave explorer.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.430 align:middle line:90%
You took 30 or 40 of them.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.325 align:middle line:90%
Now what happened?

00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:43.825 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yeah, anyone listening
who doesn't know about this

00:11:43.825 --> 00:11:46.780 align:middle line:84%
and might be wary, they
should be wary of it.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not like a party thing.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not like cocaine
or alcohol or whatever.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:55.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a totally different
kettle of fungus, as it were.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.290 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, I was young.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:01.020 align:middle line:84%
I was like 21 or
whatever, young and naive.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.455 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I thought it
would all be like-- I'd

00:12:03.455 --> 00:12:05.970 align:middle line:84%
be graced with transcendence,
and it would all be wonderful.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:09.020 align:middle line:90%
And no, it was very scary.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And I started to have what
would be called a "bad trip."

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was like my mind
was full of thousands

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.490 align:middle line:90%
of bickering voices.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.180 align:middle line:90%
And it was very, very chaotic.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.434 align:middle line:84%
It's like pure chaos,
and I couldn't stop it.

00:12:23.434 --> 00:12:24.350 align:middle line:90%
And it was very scary.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.630 align:middle line:84%
So I remember trying to go
to bed, and you know, you--

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Curl up in
the fetal position.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.484 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yeah, the
old fetal position,

00:12:29.484 --> 00:12:32.200 align:middle line:84%
which is a common
thing-- very scary.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.630 align:middle line:84%
But I was saved,
because I'd recently

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:36.990 align:middle line:84%
been studying
Gurdjieff, and Gurdjieff

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:43.900 align:middle line:84%
was a spiritual guru, spiritual
teacher in the 1920s and '30s.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And his teaching is based
around really mindfulness,

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:50.130 align:middle line:84%
as all great spiritual
teachers, they're

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.620 align:middle line:84%
teaching is based around
mindfulness, I think.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I was able to employ the
techniques that Gurdjieff wrote

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.070 align:middle line:90%
about and taught his students.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.249 align:middle line:90%
And I was able to suddenly--

00:13:01.249 --> 00:13:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even in the
midst of all of that,

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.929 align:middle line:84%
you were able to
remember to observe?

00:13:04.929 --> 00:13:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: Yes, yes.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.380 align:middle line:84%
So I saw, I suddenly
saw this, rather

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.870 align:middle line:84%
than being caught up and
consumed by this inner chaos.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I stepped aside
and could see it,

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.952 align:middle line:84%
and I could sort
of look around it

00:13:16.952 --> 00:13:18.660 align:middle line:84%
like it was an object
that I could study.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And the more closely
I saw that chaos,

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.890 align:middle line:84%
the sort of further away it
went and the less energy it had.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And then the whole
experience turned around,

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.280 align:middle line:84%
and I had a full-blown
mystical experience,

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.610 align:middle line:90%
which even now I can remember.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:35.200 align:middle line:84%
I remember lying in bed, and
it was like this divine energy

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.540 align:middle line:90%
was like flowing through me.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- tears
coming out of my eyes,

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:44.040 align:middle line:84%
and it just felt-- I was
in touch with something

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.190 align:middle line:84%
very, very powerful
and profound.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I knew
from that moment

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.610 align:middle line:84%
there was something
worth pursuing there.

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:54.580 align:middle line:84%
There was something
very important there.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you also learned
that in those initial stages,

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.649 align:middle line:84%
if you don't know what to
expect, if any fear comes in,

00:14:00.649 --> 00:14:02.190 align:middle line:84%
anything like that,
then you're going

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.165 align:middle line:90%
to go to your lower potentials.

00:14:04.165 --> 00:14:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: Yeah.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, the thing to do,
because people are always

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.990 align:middle line:84%
worried about-- it's like
going on a roller coaster

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:12.710 align:middle line:90%
ride in a way.

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:16.240 align:middle line:84%
The way I see it is what
psilocybin and other

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.002 align:middle line:84%
psychedelics do is they open
you up to your own unconscious.

00:14:19.002 --> 00:14:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And for many people,
they're disconnected

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.252 align:middle line:84%
from their unconscious,
and you don't

00:14:22.252 --> 00:14:24.251 align:middle line:84%
know how-- it's like when
you go to bed at night

00:14:24.251 --> 00:14:25.190 align:middle line:90%
and you have dreams.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have
a profound dream,

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.630 align:middle line:84%
which comes from your
unconscious, some message

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.850 align:middle line:90%
or whatever is in the drink.

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:32.340 align:middle line:84%
You don't go to
bed and think, ah,

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
lovely dreams tonight.

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Or no, maybe I'll
have a sinister dream.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.500 align:middle line:90%
You can't control it.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.017 align:middle line:84%
So it's the same with psilocybin
and other psychedelics.

00:14:40.017 --> 00:14:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
good analogy, yeah.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: They make
the unconscious--

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.244 align:middle line:84%
information from
the unconscious--

00:14:46.244 --> 00:14:47.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Manifests.

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:47.430 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: Yeah.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Manifests
whatever it needs to.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: And they
can be very tutorial.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:50.570 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what
you're gonna experience.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:52.760 align:middle line:84%
So people are
rightfully wary of that,

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.050 align:middle line:84%
and they might be frightened of
that, because you're not really

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:56.970 align:middle line:90%
in control.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:00.610 align:middle line:84%
The thing to do is, as Terence
McKenna used to say, really,

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.990 align:middle line:84%
a bad trip is where
you're being forced

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.670 align:middle line:84%
to learn more quickly than
you're accustomed to learning.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And the thing to do
is to not block out.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And the guru I mentioned in the
book, he always used to say,

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.230 align:middle line:84%
whatever you're going
through, be with it.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.260 align:middle line:90%
Be with the experience.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No resistance.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.593 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yeah, don't, because
if you set up resistance,

00:15:19.593 --> 00:15:20.790 align:middle line:90%
it's like putting up a door.

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:23.320 align:middle line:84%
If you set up a door, there
will be a pounding of the door.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.360 align:middle line:90%
So don't set up a door.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.040 align:middle line:90%
Just accept it.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.420 align:middle line:84%
People can go through--
it's not all love

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.670 align:middle line:90%
and light with psilocybin.

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.460 align:middle line:90%
It can be challenging.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.190 align:middle line:84%
You have to work through--
unfinished business

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:35.980 align:middle line:90%
will come into it.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And we all have
relationship problems.

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:41.470 align:middle line:84%
The older we get, we have--
life is made of relationships,

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.517 align:middle line:84%
and not all our
relationships are rosy.

00:15:43.517 --> 00:15:44.600 align:middle line:90%
There are tensions, right?

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.850 align:middle line:90%
We all know.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And we don't always deal with
that, because it's easier

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.150 align:middle line:84%
not to, and we carry
chips on our shoulder

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.540 align:middle line:90%
and all this kind of thing.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.950 align:middle line:84%
So the thing to do is when all
this unfinished business comes

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.210 align:middle line:90%
up, it can be challenging.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:58.190 align:middle line:84%
But just accept it, and
just go with whatever

00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:58.990 align:middle line:90%
you're being shown.

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:00.210 align:middle line:90%
Go with it and work through it.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:00.800 align:middle line:90%
And you'll come out--

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
goes through quickly

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.690 align:middle line:90%
If you don't resist, right?

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yes, and
you can learn lessons,

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:09.830 align:middle line:84%
and maybe it's equivalent
to a year's worth of therapy

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:14.215 align:middle line:84%
in a single 10 minutes
of intense experience

00:16:14.215 --> 00:16:15.610 align:middle line:90%
and intense emotion.

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:18.870 align:middle line:84%
You can work through things, and
you can have insights and such.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
psilocybin is potentially

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:26.000 align:middle line:84%
a very powerful therapeutic
tool for therapists,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.250 align:middle line:84%
because it brings all
this stuff into the light

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:31.380 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:34.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Back when,
I tried mushrooms,

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:37.990 align:middle line:84%
psilocybin a couple of times in
California when I was younger.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And one thing first, I noticed,
is men would do like you.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.390 align:middle line:84%
They'd take 30 or 40, where
the women would say, ooh,

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:46.770 align:middle line:84%
I think that's a
little too much.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:48.360 align:middle line:90%
And we'd go on the light side.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.770 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, the experiences
that I had were much lighter,

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.010 align:middle line:90%
but there were common themes.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And I only did this
a couple times.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:59.050 align:middle line:84%
One time I did it
after a day of skiing

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.185 align:middle line:84%
at the lodge in Squaw
Valley, California,

00:17:02.185 --> 00:17:03.810 align:middle line:84%
where all our friends
were, and we were

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:07.089 align:middle line:90%
drinking psilocybin milkshakes.

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:08.589 align:middle line:90%
They had blended them up.

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened was
I wasn't able to walk.

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:15.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like my knees
became gelatinous,

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:19.730 align:middle line:84%
and I was sitting on this
stool, kind of like a bar stool.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:21.180 align:middle line:90%
That was it, for hours.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:24.050 align:middle line:90%
I loved everybody walking by.

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.259 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was the most
brilliant, loving experience,

00:17:26.259 --> 00:17:29.792 align:middle line:84%
but I was completely
paralyzed from the knees down.

00:17:29.792 --> 00:17:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
happened the next time

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.330 align:middle line:84%
in the Deutsches
Museum in Germany.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:34.740 align:middle line:84%
I got stuck on
the basement floor

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:38.380 align:middle line:84%
where the tar reed baskets
were, never made it upstairs.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Because my knees
turned to rubber.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.020 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.936 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Well, it affects
people differently.

00:17:42.936 --> 00:17:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's a
genetic component to it,

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.780 align:middle line:84%
how it affects you,
probably the same with all

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.160 align:middle line:90%
the psychoactive substances.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.620 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, for some
people, I know

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.320 align:middle line:84%
I've got a good
philosopher friend who's

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.880 align:middle line:90%
basically immobile.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And he had to crawl
from-- he said

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.550 align:middle line:84%
he had to crawl from
the couch to get around,

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:02.890 align:middle line:84%
whereas I-- maybe it's
because I've done it so often.

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:05.080 align:middle line:84%
When I'm out in nature,
I'm bounding around

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.370 align:middle line:84%
with a trekking
headlamp, studying.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:08.762 align:middle line:90%
And went up Mount Snowden on--

00:18:08.762 --> 00:18:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:10.185 align:middle line:90%
That was amazing.

00:18:10.185 --> 00:18:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: --quite a
strong dose of mushrooms.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so
you can function.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:14.313 align:middle line:90%
Some people can't do that.

00:18:14.313 --> 00:18:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: I can do stuff.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.100 align:middle line:84%
But then again, at
the height of it,

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.610 align:middle line:84%
sometimes you do
have to kind of lie

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.990 align:middle line:90%
down and let it wash over you.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But one of the things
I was going to ask within that

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.680 align:middle line:84%
is that that experience
of such intense love,

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.740 align:middle line:84%
love for everything
and everybody, that's

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.120 align:middle line:90%
fairly common.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.240 align:middle line:84%
If you're not having a
bad trip, I would assume.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yeah, well,
it's almost a cliche,

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.240 align:middle line:90%
that love is everything.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.643 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean we all hold
hands and sing "Kumbaya,"

00:18:44.643 --> 00:18:46.226 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it was
everything, yeah.

00:18:46.226 --> 00:18:47.059 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: But it is.

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:49.210 align:middle line:90%
There's something that binds.

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Because the universe is
a single, interconnected,

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.150 align:middle line:90%
naturally intelligent system.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Love is somehow binding
everything together.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel that, and it
can start flowing through you,

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:90%
I think, with psilocybin.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's important for-- I've
had experience, getting back

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.550 align:middle line:84%
what I said earlier about the
difficult relationships we

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:13.330 align:middle line:84%
have, straight
away the next day,

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.870 align:middle line:84%
I've contacted someone
who-- I've said,

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:19.460 align:middle line:84%
I know we don't talk, but
I love I love you still,

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:20.175 align:middle line:90%
kind of thing.

00:19:20.175 --> 00:19:21.300 align:middle line:90%
I've done this a few times.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you were
feeling all this love.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.970 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yes, because it's
very important to do that.

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like we're our own
worst enemy a lot of the time,

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:30.800 align:middle line:84%
because we bear grudges and
negative emotions of one

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.450 align:middle line:90%
kind or another consume us.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:35.710 align:middle line:84%
But psilocybin can-- you
can break free of all that.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:36.390 align:middle line:90%
You really can.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That makes sense.

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:37.978 align:middle line:90%
You're creating connectivity.

00:19:37.978 --> 00:19:41.120 align:middle line:84%
Just as the fungi
connect with everything

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.170 align:middle line:84%
underneath our Earth, it
creates that sense of-- love

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:46.510 align:middle line:84%
is nothing but that sense,
really, of connectivity

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.160 align:middle line:90%
to everything.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.060 align:middle line:84%
So that makes a lot
of sense that you

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.990 align:middle line:84%
could heal relationships after
you just had that exploding

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:53.200 align:middle line:90%
love experience.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: And
that's why people--

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.470 align:middle line:84%
the word "spiritual" can
mean different things

00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:59.460 align:middle line:90%
to different people.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not like a
scientifically hard word.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And I often use-- for me,
the psilocybin experience

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:06.390 align:middle line:90%
is spiritual.

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that means it
is an emotional connection

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:17.170 align:middle line:84%
to some sort of bigger,
deliberate, purposeful flow

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:18.363 align:middle line:90%
to reality, if you like.

00:20:18.363 --> 00:20:19.071 align:middle line:90%
And you get that.

00:20:19.071 --> 00:20:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And love somehow is
bound up with all that.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.050 align:middle line:90%
So they are important things.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:25.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's all--
it's not wishy-washy.

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.330 align:middle line:84%
The psilocybin experience
is not wishy-washy.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.060 align:middle line:90%
Because it actually works.

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:36.290 align:middle line:84%
People are interested in
the meaning of life, right?

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:37.090 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is.

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And we all explore
life in different ways.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.540 align:middle line:84%
The thing-- and Terence McKenna
used to talk about this.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.570 align:middle line:84%
The mushroom is
something tangible

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:47.370 align:middle line:90%
that you can hold in your hand.

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:48.860 align:middle line:90%
And you consume it.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:50.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is another
symbolic aspect to it.

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:52.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like I've talked
in my "Manna" film.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.760 align:middle line:84%
I talked about consuming
the mushroom is

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.610 align:middle line:90%
like consuming the truth.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:58.360 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a real thing that
can be actively consumed.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about the
whole symbology of that,

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:05.870 align:middle line:90%
it's-- so it works.

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:08.030 align:middle line:90%
And it can do wonderful things.

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:10.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important
to-- and it needs

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.120 align:middle line:90%
to come out of the subculture.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And it needs to
be available to--

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, we're going to
get into that and why it's not

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:22.070 align:middle line:90%
and what is and why what is is.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:25.130 align:middle line:84%
But that theme that you were
just talking about of love,

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, ultimately you ended up
there after all these journeys.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny, the
various messengers

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.460 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't expect
from around the planet.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.620 align:middle line:84%
David Icke, one of his
books, love is all there is;

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.645 align:middle line:84%
everything else is illusion,
after he went to South America

00:21:39.645 --> 00:21:42.740 align:middle line:84%
and was broken open,
so it comes from all.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you come down to
the essence of the exploration,

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.400 align:middle line:90%
that is where we end up.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.120 align:middle line:90%
And I was lucky.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.760 align:middle line:84%
I got to go there a couple
times, first times out

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.640 align:middle line:90%
of the chute.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Terrence McKenna-- it's hard
to talk about psilocybin

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.390 align:middle line:84%
without Terence
McKenna's name coming in.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And you actually met him
in '92 at Glastonbury

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.255 align:middle line:90%
at a music festival.

00:22:02.255 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: No, no,
I didn't meet him.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.952 align:middle line:84%
I made friends with
the shaman who worked--

00:22:07.952 --> 00:22:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, the shaman, OK.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.189 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: I did meet Terence
briefly a few days later.

00:22:12.189 --> 00:22:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, talk about
that, those early days

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and what McKenna was
bringing to the table.

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Well, for me, I went
to Glastonbury Music Festival

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:23.180 align:middle line:84%
in 1992, and that was just
before my mushroom fever

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.990 align:middle line:84%
period, as I call my
mushroom fever period.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:29.370 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, Terrence McKenna
had a profound role.

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.910 align:middle line:84%
What Terence did was he
vindicated the psilocybin

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:34.170 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Because he was quite a sort of
intellectual, and he's a bard.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And he told stories, and he
gave it sort of a thumbs-up

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.520 align:middle line:84%
and said, look, there is
something to this experience.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And he wasn't just
sort of a hippie guy.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:52.850 align:middle line:84%
He was very-- a bit like Aldous
Huxley, maybe, very educated,

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.170 align:middle line:84%
knew a lot of things about
a lot of different subjects.

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And he gave the
thumbs-up and said,

00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:00.410 align:middle line:84%
there's something very
profound about this experience.

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And he championed the
psilocybin experience.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.740 align:middle line:84%
He was a chief spokesman
for psilocybin mushroom

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:09.920 align:middle line:90%
use in the '90s.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.682 align:middle line:84%
So I came across his
work through the shaman,

00:23:12.682 --> 00:23:14.140 align:middle line:84%
because they were
working with him.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.223 align:middle line:84%
And they did this music
track with Terence McKenna

00:23:16.223 --> 00:23:17.050 align:middle line:90%
speaking on.

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, and then I read "The
Archaic Revival" and "Food

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.250 align:middle line:84%
of the Gods," and, yeah,
he definitely helped.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:25.830 align:middle line:90%


00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:28.950 align:middle line:84%
What I've said in the
book is one difference,

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:31.490 align:middle line:84%
is that Terence McKenna
always suggested

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:34.040 align:middle line:84%
that you take the mushroom
in silent darkness,

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.110 align:middle line:84%
close your eyes, and
experience these visions,

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.000 align:middle line:90%
which is a useful technique.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And I used to do that, and
lots of people do that.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.934 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
side to the experience,

00:23:42.934 --> 00:23:44.850 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I've
explored, that's taking--

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:46.540 align:middle line:84%
and obviously this
is a rare thing,

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:48.120 align:middle line:84%
because you need
equipment and such,

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:52.240 align:middle line:84%
but my preferred methodology
is to take the mushroom

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.710 align:middle line:84%
in situ, out in the
wilderness around a campfire

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:58.120 align:middle line:84%
with mushrooms picked
in the local vicinity.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:58.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Connected
to all of nature.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yeah, and
that's equally as good

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.282 align:middle line:84%
as this-- it depends
where you are.

00:24:01.282 --> 00:24:02.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't always do that.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your
own constitution.

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:04.370 align:middle line:84%
If you're like me,
you wouldn't be

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:05.980 align:middle line:84%
able to take a step
to get there, right?

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:06.510 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: Yeah, right.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You'd be stuck
wherever it kicks in.

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: So take them where
you feel most comfortable,

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:12.450 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but so Terence McKenna
was very useful in my journey,

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:18.200 align:middle line:84%
definitely helped
me in my journey.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he spoke
out, and you speak out.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:23.060 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting about this,
as we started the conversation,

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.180 align:middle line:84%
it's a Schedule 1
drug, illegal drug.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: In the same category
as crack, cocaine, and heroin.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And heroin, exactly.

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:31.500 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: Can you believe that?

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
there's a difference.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is one of the
things that really bothers me,

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:42.340 align:middle line:84%
and whether it's ayahuasca
or whether it's psilocybin,

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:46.890 align:middle line:84%
that these are drugs that
expand awareness and expand

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:52.610 align:middle line:84%
consciousness and exploration
into arguably other realms.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And the drugs that
they're alongside

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.460 align:middle line:84%
in their illegal status
are ones that remove you

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.670 align:middle line:84%
from that, that dull
the senses, that

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:05.120 align:middle line:84%
turn you into maybe more
of an automaton almost

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.450 align:middle line:84%
and also can create dangers,
truly dangerous behaviors.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:11.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we were talking about
just the notion of alcohol

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:12.650 align:middle line:90%
alone off camera.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:14.640 align:middle line:84%
That's not illegal,
and what it does, how

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.140 align:middle line:90%
it's trashed whole cultures.

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.840 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Well, you can
tell a lot about a culture

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.845 align:middle line:84%
by the drugs that it
endorses and supports.

00:25:23.845 --> 00:25:25.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In Britain,
alcohol big time.

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yeah, I mean,
you've got pubs everywhere.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.180 align:middle line:90%
You've got off-licenses.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:32.430 align:middle line:84%
You've got adverts for alcohol,
and alcohol, which essentially

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:33.970 align:middle line:90%
reduces consciousness.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:35.892 align:middle line:84%
The more you drink,
the less conscious--

00:25:35.892 --> 00:25:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's an anesthetic.

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.974 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Consciousness
dissolves, basically,

00:25:38.974 --> 00:25:40.350 align:middle line:90%
until you're unconscious.

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:43.117 align:middle line:84%
And yet that is
the key substance.

00:25:43.117 --> 00:25:43.825 align:middle line:90%
That's the only--

00:25:43.825 --> 00:25:45.366 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's your
social lubricant.

00:25:45.366 --> 00:25:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yeah, it's the only
major psychoactive substance

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:52.290 align:middle line:84%
in the UK and elsewhere that
the government, the authorities,

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:54.390 align:middle line:84%
will say, yes,
you can have that.

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:55.450 align:middle line:90%
You want a psychoactive?

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Have alcohol, and we'll
supply it for you.

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.945 align:middle line:90%
So there's something here.

00:26:00.945 --> 00:26:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, there's
something more insidious.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: There's something
wrong with a culture that

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.090 align:middle line:90%
drowns itself in alcohol.

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And maybe people
are deeply unhappy.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.820 align:middle line:84%
If you get heavily
into drink, it's

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.700 align:middle line:84%
probably because you're
unhappy about something,

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and you don't want
to face something.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So rather than face--
because the body and the mind

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.740 align:middle line:84%
want to be-- just like your
body wants to heal itself

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:25.250 align:middle line:84%
and can heal itself,
the psyche can as well.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And it will let you know through
your dreams or through moods.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And you keep coming
back to a certain issue.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:36.370 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't
want to face it,

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have a culture
that supports facing it,

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:40.470 align:middle line:90%
then drown it.

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:42.280 align:middle line:90%
So it's crazy.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, because
I'm in America now,

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:49.270 align:middle line:84%
I noticed on the television
I've seen two adverts-- I just

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.645 align:middle line:84%
briefly put the television
on, and there were two adverts

00:26:51.645 --> 00:26:55.070 align:middle line:90%
for some medical drug.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And towards the
end of the advert,

00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:59.650 align:middle line:84%
they talked about the
possible adverse side effects.

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you don't
have those ads in England?

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: No, I've never
seen anything like it.

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.652 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHING]
It's a joke here.

00:27:03.652 --> 00:27:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yeah,
it's like they were

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:08.791 align:middle line:84%
proud of the possible negative
side effects to the point

00:27:08.791 --> 00:27:10.540 align:middle line:84%
where they were getting
worse-- I thought,

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:12.060 align:middle line:84%
when are they going to
stop, these negative--?

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.394 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Rectal bleeding,
heart attack, possible death.

00:27:14.394 --> 00:27:16.643 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yeah, and it's
like they were selling-- this

00:27:16.643 --> 00:27:17.800 align:middle line:90%
is how bad this could be.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:22.465 align:middle line:84%
And it's like liver failure
was-- or your heart will stop

00:27:22.465 --> 00:27:24.350 align:middle line:90%
or you'll get a brain aneurysm.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And yet, psilocybin has
never killed anyone.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:28.640 align:middle line:90%
It's non-addictive.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.960 align:middle line:90%
You can't overdose on it.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.980 align:middle line:84%
It's something you'll do two or
three times a year at the most.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:34.980 align:middle line:84%
That's all I do now
with psilocybin.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not a party thing.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:37.770 align:middle line:90%
And yet it's that Schedule 1.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly,
Schedule 1 prescription

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:48.370 align:middle line:84%
in America, prescription
drugs kill more people

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:51.380 align:middle line:84%
than heroin and crack
cocaine combined.

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:55.160 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
really-- if you

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:58.340 align:middle line:84%
compare that with the
psilocybin situation,

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.612 align:middle line:90%
it's just absolutely ridiculous.

00:28:00.612 --> 00:28:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's an
upside down lens.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:04.220 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: So it's crying
out for some sort of change.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:04.886 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:28:04.886 --> 00:28:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And you were a fan of the life
and times of Philip K. Dick.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, this kind of
feeds into it as well,

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:16.865 align:middle line:84%
his view of how upside
down culture was

00:28:16.865 --> 00:28:19.080 align:middle line:90%
and the messaging to culture.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And just from that
alone, I mean,

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:23.440 align:middle line:84%
that's a really large
topic, but what's

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.810 align:middle line:84%
your takeaway, that
these Schedule 1

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:28.860 align:middle line:84%
drugs include psilocybin,
where alcohol is not even

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.360 align:middle line:90%
on the schedule?

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Well, I
sometimes draw an analogy.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:38.860 align:middle line:84%
This is a strange analogy
with sleep and awakening.

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.830 align:middle line:84%
If you're in a dream,
and you're fast asleep,

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:45.240 align:middle line:84%
your brain will be
keeping you in that state

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.360 align:middle line:84%
through chemical
changes in your brain.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you're dreaming,
you're deep asleep,

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.160 align:middle line:84%
and there's a noise
in the environment,

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.830 align:middle line:84%
you will incorporate
that into a dream.

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So your brain wants
to keep you asleep.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And so chemistry
is ruling the day.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.000 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
that same principle

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.200 align:middle line:84%
is happening in culture
at large, that there's

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:08.410 align:middle line:84%
certain substances flowing
through the collective human

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:09.760 align:middle line:90%
nervous system, if you like.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And the time is now ready
for that to change, I think.

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:18.989 align:middle line:84%
And if we can get psilocybin
and ayahuasca integrated--

00:29:18.989 --> 00:29:20.030 align:middle line:90%
this is the big question.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like marijuana
becoming integrated.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.538 align:middle line:10%
>>POWELL: Yes, it needs to be
integrated in a civilized way

00:29:23.538 --> 00:29:26.196 align:middle line:10%
and allowed to flow for
people in a civilized way.

00:29:26.196 --> 00:29:27.570 align:middle line:10%
It shouldn't be
forced on anyone,

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.410 align:middle line:10%
but it should be
there for-- people

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:32.470 align:middle line:10%
should, in a civilized way, have
access to these experiences,

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:35.180 align:middle line:10%
maybe through what I call
revitalization centers,

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:38.080 align:middle line:10%
where you go and have
as much facilitation

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.470 align:middle line:10%
as you need to have an
optimal psilocybin experience.

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:44.090 align:middle line:90%
So it's crying out.

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think that maybe there's
some kind of dynamic to it

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:51.210 align:middle line:90%
and the way culture evolves.

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you think that
culture is evolving,

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.730 align:middle line:84%
there's an evolution
to consciousness,

00:29:55.730 --> 00:30:00.230 align:middle line:84%
and there's an evolution to
global human consciousness.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:01.630 align:middle line:90%
It can't just happen.

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:04.050 align:middle line:84%
It's just like your
body when you grow.

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:05.910 align:middle line:84%
You go through stages,
and you mature.

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:07.320 align:middle line:90%
It's like a natural process.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:11.270 align:middle line:84%
It might be the same with
our spiritual evolution.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a natural-- so
maybe things have to be-- it's

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:15.950 align:middle line:90%
like a dynamic.

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:22.530 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like it's something
fictional about human history.

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And there's like plot
devices, if you like.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:26.530 align:middle line:90%
It's almost fictional.

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we
learn from contrast,

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.380 align:middle line:90%
bumping off of things.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:30.660 align:middle line:90%
And you say we've reached--

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:31.190 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: And then
there's waves.

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:33.540 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to the
'60s with psychedelics,

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:34.480 align:middle line:90%
it didn't all die.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.560 align:middle line:84%
It just sort of receded, and
now it's coming back again.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.101 align:middle line:84%
Because it will never
be boring and old hat.

00:30:40.101 --> 00:30:41.725 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
direct experience.

00:30:41.725 --> 00:30:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you're saying it's
because people are at a point,

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.035 align:middle line:84%
in your understanding,
the way you see it,

00:30:47.035 --> 00:30:49.410 align:middle line:84%
is they're at a point where
they're looking for something

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:50.670 align:middle line:90%
substantive.

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Here we have all of the glitz
and glamour thrown at us,

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.720 align:middle line:84%
all the externals, all of
the ways to get cheap credit,

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.520 align:middle line:84%
to buy cheap things,
and so forth,

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.895 align:middle line:84%
and that we're even more
hungry than ever for substance.

00:31:01.895 --> 00:31:02.770 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: Well, yeah.

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.130 align:middle line:84%
In the intro to the
book, I talked about

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:08.200 align:middle line:84%
that psilocybin is a
substance with substance.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Because most other things
we buy into, it's glitzy

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:14.330 align:middle line:90%
and it's on the outside.

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:16.530 align:middle line:90%
And there's no substance to it.

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:19.920 align:middle line:84%
But psilocybin is literally
a substance with substance.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:20.640 align:middle line:90%
And people do--

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.987 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it takes courage.

00:31:21.987 --> 00:31:22.820 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: Well, yes.

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:23.986 align:middle line:90%
But there shouldn't be fear.

00:31:23.986 --> 00:31:27.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's worse when there's
all these taboos around it

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:28.890 align:middle line:84%
and people aren't
talking about it

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:30.250 align:middle line:90%
and it's kept in the subculture.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.690 align:middle line:90%
That's can keep the fear going.

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:35.410 align:middle line:84%
But when you hear rational
conversations, and I think

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:37.580 align:middle line:84%
we're having a
rational conversation--

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.570 align:middle line:84%
and there's lots of
people, not just me.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:42.840 align:middle line:84%
There's other people with
voices for the virtues

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.130 align:middle line:90%
of the psilocybin experience.

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:46.790 align:middle line:84%
There's no need
to have the fear.

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And we need to create
loving, positive conditions

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.420 align:middle line:84%
within which you can
get these changes

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:56.572 align:middle line:84%
and facilitate
these changes in--

00:31:56.572 --> 00:31:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It has to do with
shamanic healers and ayahuasca.

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: Yeah.

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:04.030 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, it's
quite popular now.

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:06.920 align:middle line:84%
If you can afford it, you
go all the way to Peru

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.780 align:middle line:84%
to take part in
ayahuasca ceremonies.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And of course, psilocybin, it's
almost-- the active ingredient

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.180 align:middle line:84%
in ayahuasca, the main
active ingredient is DMT.

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And psilocybin is
4-hydroxy N, N DMT.

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:24.170 align:middle line:90%
So it's almost the same as DMT.

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:26.101 align:middle line:90%
They're very kind of similar.

00:32:26.101 --> 00:32:28.642 align:middle line:84%
So you shouldn't need to spend
thousands of dollars to go all

00:32:28.642 --> 00:32:33.180 align:middle line:84%
the way-- it should be something
that could be facilitated in--

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why haven't
psilocybin mushrooms

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:39.260 align:middle line:84%
risen a little more on that
front, alongside ayahuasca,

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.639 align:middle line:90%
you think?

00:32:40.639 --> 00:32:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: I think the thing with
ayahuasca is it's very sexy,

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.014 align:middle line:84%
the whole thing with
the Peruvian shaman--

00:32:45.014 --> 00:32:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Throwing up.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yeah, Peru,
the jungle, shamans,

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:49.470 align:middle line:90%
all the native music--

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:50.678 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Barfing. [LAUGHING]

00:32:50.678 --> 00:32:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: Yeah.

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's just
got an allure to it.

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:54.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's fashionable.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.690 align:middle line:90%
It's very fashionable.

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:56.935 align:middle line:90%
There's articles and that.

00:32:56.935 --> 00:32:58.893 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the mushroom is
always in the background.

00:32:58.893 --> 00:33:00.822 align:middle line:90%
It's this thing growing.

00:33:00.822 --> 00:33:01.780 align:middle line:90%
People don't even know.

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Probably people don't know
that within a few miles away--

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:07.814 align:middle line:84%
they might be saving money
to go to Peru to take part

00:33:07.814 --> 00:33:09.230 align:middle line:84%
in an ayahuasca
thing, not knowing

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:11.490 align:middle line:84%
that within a few miles
of where they live,

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:14.659 align:middle line:84%
this very similar
substance is growing.

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
the Pacific Northwest?

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:18.160 align:middle line:90%
That's big mushroom territory.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: There are 200 species.

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:22.235 align:middle line:84%
There are at least, I
think, 200, or about

00:33:22.235 --> 00:33:25.042 align:middle line:84%
or maybe more, 200 species of
psilocybin mushrooms worldwide.

00:33:25.042 --> 00:33:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And they keep
discovering new ones.

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing with the common one

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:32.890 align:middle line:84%
in the UK in certain parts of
North America, the liberty cap,

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:35.520 align:middle line:84%
is if you're at the right
place at the right time,

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:37.330 align:middle line:84%
you can find hundreds
and hundreds.

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:41.480 align:middle line:90%
And the Earth is packing it.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.950 align:middle line:90%
Gaia is giving it away.

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:47.110 align:middle line:84%
As a dealer, Gaia
is second to none.

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:49.559 align:middle line:90%
It can be difficult sometimes.

00:33:49.559 --> 00:33:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But she gives freely.

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:51.433 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: Yes.

00:33:51.433 --> 00:33:54.510 align:middle line:84%
The distribution can be
unpredictable, but yeah.

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:57.090 align:middle line:84%
It's all there, and
that's the beauty of it.

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And I've never paid--
I've taken psilocybin

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:03.280 align:middle line:84%
maybe 140, 150 times,
never paid for any of it.

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.297 align:middle line:90%
It's all come free.

00:34:04.297 --> 00:34:05.255 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There you go.

00:34:05.255 --> 00:34:06.879 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: So it's an
astonishing thing.

00:34:06.879 --> 00:34:09.929 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not disrupting
culture in that sense.

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so now,
we talked about what

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:14.929 align:middle line:90%
happened the first time.

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:17.780 align:middle line:84%
When you were in your
mushroom fever stage,

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:20.060 align:middle line:84%
you were taking them quite
often and going deep.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.679 align:middle line:84%
And you started having a
completely different kind

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:23.800 align:middle line:90%
of experience.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.929 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the type
of experiences you had,

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:29.760 align:middle line:84%
say, when you were in the
Lakes District or Snowdonia,

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.510 align:middle line:84%
where you were
starting to connect

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:35.199 align:middle line:84%
on a very deep level with the
intelligence of all things.

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:37.614 align:middle line:84%
And share with us
what that was like.

00:34:37.614 --> 00:34:39.239 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Well, it
was a new discovery.

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:42.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'd never really
been trekking around the UK

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.980 align:middle line:84%
before till I discovered,
literally, the Lake District.

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And I saw books on it
and the pictures of it.

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:50.389 align:middle line:84%
I thought, this
can't be in England.

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:52.100 align:middle line:90%
This is mountains and stuff.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:57.040 align:middle line:84%
It was like fairytale,
Lord of the Rings kind of.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And so we went, this
guy, I'll call The Guru,

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:04.600 align:middle line:84%
we went trekking in like 1995
and for subsequent years.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:08.179 align:middle line:84%
And the mushroom, the discovery
was-- I remember the first time

00:35:08.179 --> 00:35:10.720 align:middle line:84%
I trekked in the Lake District
thinking how beautiful it was.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.190 align:middle line:90%
And I was just really at home.

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:13.530 align:middle line:84%
I just love being out
in the wilderness.

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:15.321 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've wanted
to go there so badly,

00:35:15.321 --> 00:35:17.020 align:middle line:84%
but we always drove
right past it.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: I just love
being in the wilderness,

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:20.530 align:middle line:90%
everything about it--

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It looks so beautiful.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:21.795 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: --when you're
away from the city

00:35:21.795 --> 00:35:22.860 align:middle line:84%
and you're back to
nature and stuff.

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:23.280 align:middle line:90%
So I loved it.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
thinking, I wonder

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:25.490 align:middle line:90%
if the mushroom grows here.

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
thinking, it can't.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:29.170 align:middle line:84%
There's no way the
mushroom can grow here.

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:30.370 align:middle line:84%
That would be too
good to be true.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:31.828 align:middle line:84%
It would be ridiculous
if you could

00:35:31.828 --> 00:35:34.030 align:middle line:84%
get this mushroom growing
here, the one I've

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:35.367 align:middle line:90%
been taking in London.

00:35:35.367 --> 00:35:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And we went back there in the
autumn, and lo and behold,

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:38.908 align:middle line:90%
they were growing everywhere.

00:35:38.908 --> 00:35:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And then to take the mushroom
in situ in an environment

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:44.892 align:middle line:84%
like that in an oak
forest or whatever.

00:35:44.892 --> 00:35:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You just pluck
the out of the ground?

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:47.530 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: Yeah.

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, yeah, I mean, it's
illegal now to do that.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Back in the day, you could
legally pick and consume.

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can't
pluck them anymore?

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.452 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: That's how
absurd the law is.

00:35:57.452 --> 00:35:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we'll get
to the law in a little bit.

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Let just stay with
the experience.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.541 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: But yeah,
the experiences I

00:36:02.541 --> 00:36:06.190 align:middle line:84%
had being in a forest, I
just felt really at one

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:09.120 align:middle line:84%
with the environment,
like I was really at home.

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.280 align:middle line:84%
The campsite would be
like you're indoors.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.260 align:middle line:90%
And it was like very palatial.

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.320 align:middle line:84%
So all the rocks
that you'd sit on,

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.810 align:middle line:84%
you'd become familiar with
the campsite and the moths

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:19.320 align:middle line:90%
and the individual trees.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:23.376 align:middle line:84%
And it was like being in a
palace, an organic palace.

00:36:23.376 --> 00:36:25.510 align:middle line:90%
And I absolutely loved it.

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:28.389 align:middle line:84%
And then that's how this
natural intelligence paradigm

00:36:28.389 --> 00:36:29.805 align:middle line:84%
began to form in
me, which I wrote

00:36:29.805 --> 00:36:31.990 align:middle line:84%
in another book, "Darwin's
Unfinished Business,"

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:34.050 align:middle line:84%
about this natural
intelligence paradigm.

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And I just saw
directly that life,

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:40.560 align:middle line:84%
when I was looking at plants and
trees in the sort of ecosystem,

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:43.490 align:middle line:84%
I could see that life
was an intelligence

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:46.530 align:middle line:84%
and the evolution was a
naturally intelligent process

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:49.110 align:middle line:84%
for building together
all these organisms.

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:51.510 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the
way mainstream science

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:54.650 align:middle line:84%
will delineate
life and evolution.

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:56.630 align:middle line:84%
Intelligence is a
word they loathe

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:58.880 align:middle line:84%
to attribute to life, let
alone the evolution of life.

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.713 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, then
you get it crossed over

00:37:00.713 --> 00:37:02.320 align:middle line:90%
into intelligent design.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.394 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yeah, that
confuses the matter.

00:37:05.394 --> 00:37:07.560 align:middle line:84%
The natural intelligence
paradigm that I write about

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.360 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't be confused
with intelligent design,

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.530 align:middle line:84%
creationism, because I'm
arguing that intelligence

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:16.815 align:middle line:84%
is intrinsic to nature, that
life itself, this, we are,

00:37:16.815 --> 00:37:20.570 align:middle line:84%
our bodies, an organism
as a network of naturally

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:22.600 align:middle line:90%
intelligent processes.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:26.240 align:middle line:84%
So life itself, I argue,
is an intelligence.

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.690 align:middle line:84%
So I saw all that
clearly, or felt

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:31.820 align:middle line:84%
I saw all that clearly
through these psilocybin

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:34.510 align:middle line:84%
experiences out
in these forests.

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, then I came back, and I
tend to bang on the thing-- I

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:40.150 align:middle line:90%
bang on about two things.

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:44.060 align:middle line:84%
I bang on about psilocybin, that
it's something worth banging on

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.720 align:middle line:84%
about, and we need to integrate
it into human culture,

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and the law needs to change
and it needs to be integrated.

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And I bang on about the natural
intelligence paradigm as well,

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:59.340 align:middle line:84%
and they're sort of two
separate things, really.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:02.920 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it was through
my mushroom experiences

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:06.190 align:middle line:84%
that I saw that there was
something wrong with the way we

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:08.020 align:middle line:90%
appraise life on Earth.

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And if we appraise
life on Earth wrongly,

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:14.240 align:middle line:84%
if we interpret
what life on Earth

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:18.090 align:middle line:84%
is, what the
biosphere is wrongly,

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:21.830 align:middle line:84%
and we don't appraise it in the
way it needs to be appraised,

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:25.730 align:middle line:84%
then our relationship with
the biosphere will be wanting.

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's part of
the problem we're in now,

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:29.670 align:middle line:84%
is we don't understand
what life is,

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:32.675 align:middle line:84%
and we don't accord
intelligence to life on Earth.

00:38:32.675 --> 00:38:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.009 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Things
are changing slowly

00:38:35.009 --> 00:38:36.340 align:middle line:90%
with the biomimicry movement.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Biomimicry movement are
interested in looking at nature

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:42.210 align:middle line:90%
to solve technological problems.

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:44.030 align:middle line:90%
How does nature do it?

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:47.480 align:middle line:84%
How does this organism
overcome this problem

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.600 align:middle line:90%
or overcome this obstacle?

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Ah, we can come up with
technological solutions

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.990 align:middle line:84%
by looking at how
nature, how life does it.

00:38:56.990 --> 00:39:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And the phrase they use to say
what the biomimicry movement is

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.980 align:middle line:84%
is "the conscious emulation
of nature's genius."

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.945 align:middle line:84%
So that's the step in
the right direction.

00:39:06.945 --> 00:39:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think it's just
a metaphor, nature's genius.

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:11.635 align:middle line:90%
Nature is ingenious.

00:39:11.635 --> 00:39:13.320 align:middle line:90%
Our bodies are spun of it.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.110 align:middle line:84%
We've got the genetic code
inside every one of our cells,

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:18.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's a digital--
sorry, you've

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:20.040 align:middle line:90%
got me banging on about this.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:20.873 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's OK.

00:39:20.873 --> 00:39:21.970 align:middle line:90%
Band on about it.

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:27.730 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: People don't know
that DNA is a digital code.

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:29.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a quaternary
code, not binary code.

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:32.400 align:middle line:84%
It uses four
possible nucleotides.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:37.160 align:middle line:84%
So the evolution of genomes,
of genes through time,

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.790 align:middle line:84%
the evolution of
life through time,

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:45.230 align:middle line:84%
is a digital information
processing process.

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:47.962 align:middle line:84%
And that's got intelligence
written all over that.

00:39:47.962 --> 00:39:49.420 align:middle line:84%
That's the essence
of intelligence.

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:50.836 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And your
arguments start

00:39:50.836 --> 00:39:53.010 align:middle line:84%
coming up with Bruce
Lipton, "Biology of Belief."

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness impacts DNA, the
direction of DNA and so forth.

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And where does that
all fit in, or does it?

00:39:58.940 --> 00:39:59.898 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: I don't know.

00:39:59.898 --> 00:40:03.230 align:middle line:84%
That's more-- what
I'm arguing for is

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:06.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm basically a hermeneuticist.

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually I'm
a psilocybinetic

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:10.090 align:middle line:90%
biohermeneuticist.

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:12.540 align:middle line:84%
A psilocybinetic
biohermeneuticist--

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.230 align:middle line:90%
what on Earth is that?

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Hermeneutics is
about interpretation.

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And hermeneutics
used to be mainly

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:28.830 align:middle line:84%
about interpreting religious
texts according to the culture.

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:31.920 align:middle line:84%
But hermeneutics has now spread
into different disciplines now.

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And you can find books on
environmental hermeneutics

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:39.980 align:middle line:84%
about how we interpret the
planet, the Earth, nature,

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:41.210 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:42.990 align:middle line:90%
And it can be reinterpreted.

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Everything's down
to interpretation

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:46.146 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the day.

00:40:46.146 --> 00:40:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Most things you
can think of have

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.020 align:middle line:90%
to be interpreted in some way.

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:52.490 align:middle line:84%
So psilocybinetic
biohermeneutics,

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:56.220 align:middle line:84%
then, is how we interpret
life-- bio, biology.

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And psilocybinetic
is interpreting

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:00.510 align:middle line:90%
through psilocybin.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:03.600 align:middle line:90%


00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.410 align:middle line:90%
So it's about interpretation.

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And so what the natural
intelligence paradigm is really

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:11.510 align:middle line:84%
a reinterpretation of
what evolving life is.

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:13.240 align:middle line:84%
When you get into
these things like Bruce

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:16.267 align:middle line:84%
Lipton and conscious--
I'm steering clear of that

00:41:16.267 --> 00:41:16.850 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:18.308 align:middle line:84%
What I'm basically
interested in is

00:41:18.308 --> 00:41:21.270 align:middle line:84%
this basic premise
that evolution

00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:22.490 align:middle line:90%
through natural selection--

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:24.645 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All unfolding
through a native intelligence.

00:41:24.645 --> 00:41:26.478 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: --that it's
a natural intelligence

00:41:26.478 --> 00:41:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and that life and
the environment

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:29.240 align:middle line:90%
aren't two separate things.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:32.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a single system
folding back on itself.

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:35.400 align:middle line:84%
The potential for life
and the evolution of life

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.002 align:middle line:84%
are encoded within that
system from the get-go.

00:41:38.002 --> 00:41:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From which
we've separated ourselves.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yes, we've kind
of cocooned ourselves,

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.030 align:middle line:84%
as I said earlier,
into cities, and we're

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.760 align:middle line:90%
sort of going it alone.

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How can
that be sustainable?

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:48.191 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Well, it's
not sustainable.

00:41:48.191 --> 00:41:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing
with sustainability--

00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:51.640 align:middle line:90%
because that's a buzz word now.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Everyone talks about
sustainability.

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Getting back to biomimicry, not
only have individual organisms

00:41:58.370 --> 00:42:02.210 align:middle line:84%
learned how to fly and
survive under water

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and survive droughts and
all this kind of thing,

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:10.330 align:middle line:84%
but ecosystems and body
sustainability-- life

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:12.370 align:middle line:84%
has sustained itself
for 4 billion years.

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:15.420 align:middle line:84%
So this sustainability that
everyone's going on about

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:17.470 align:middle line:84%
is something that life
has already solved that.

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:20.220 align:middle line:84%
So we need to
learn-- the reason I

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:23.470 align:middle line:84%
think it's important to embrace
this natural intelligence

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:27.810 align:middle line:84%
paradigm is we're then
more likely to look

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:30.970 align:middle line:84%
to nature to learn and to
look for the wisdom that

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:32.840 align:middle line:90%
is within all things.

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And we don't do
that at the moment.

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of the
reason we're disconnected

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:41.670 align:middle line:84%
from the biosphere and
we're ruining the biosphere

00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:43.730 align:middle line:84%
and we're having problems
with sustainable living

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and this kind of thing is
because we don't acknowledge

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:49.730 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom and intelligence
that's within the biosphere.

00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:53.020 align:middle line:84%
We're like the prodigal
species that goes off,

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:54.090 align:middle line:90%
does its own thing.

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And eventually we'll be
called back to the fold,

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:57.846 align:middle line:84%
and we'll find our
rightful place.

00:42:57.846 --> 00:42:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we can't
find anything of substance

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:01.906 align:middle line:90%
unless we do go there.

00:43:01.906 --> 00:43:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And because the rest are
artificial constructs that

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:07.410 align:middle line:84%
have been manufactured and
we have given our consent

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:09.430 align:middle line:90%
to choose this as a way of life.

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:11.330 align:middle line:84%
That's our fault
for buying into it.

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Not that we're not being well
manipulated, but nonetheless,

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:17.000 align:middle line:84%
it's a choice to
move away from that.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.580 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Well, we're at a
very important critical time

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:21.800 align:middle line:90%
of human culture.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Business as usual cannot
go on indefinitely.

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:32.740 align:middle line:84%
We need a paradigm shift in how
we see the-- the biosphere is

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:33.780 align:middle line:90%
a very important thing.

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:35.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a word that
people don't use a lot.

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:38.200 align:middle line:90%
They might talk about Gaia.

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Gaia, or the biosphere,
is very important

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:44.900 align:middle line:84%
to realize that we're
part of this naturally

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.070 align:middle line:90%
intelligent whole.

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:49.120 align:middle line:84%
There's all the information
within that whole

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.780 align:middle line:84%
to heal itself and
for humans to have

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:53.980 align:middle line:84%
a happy, sustainable
future, where

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:57.500 align:middle line:84%
we share the great wealth
that's on the Earth.

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:58.135 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

00:43:58.135 --> 00:43:58.968 align:middle line:90%
It's all been given.

00:43:58.968 --> 00:44:00.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a providence.

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:04.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's attitudes need to
change and relationships.

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:07.110 align:middle line:84%
It gets down to
relationships again.

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:10.820 align:middle line:84%
The human race, I would argue--
this is just my opinion--

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:15.980 align:middle line:84%
has an unhealthy relationship
to the rest of the web of life.

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's evinced through our
paradigms of life and the fact

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.360 align:middle line:84%
that we don't
accord intelligence

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:25.260 align:middle line:84%
to evolution and
to the biosphere.

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
needs to change.

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:31.170 align:middle line:84%
So my drive in
life is to promote

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:33.924 align:middle line:84%
this natural
intelligence paradigm.

00:44:33.924 --> 00:44:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and
toward that end,

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.381 align:middle line:84%
there's something else
here that you experienced?

00:44:37.381 --> 00:44:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And you experienced it on
more than one occasion,

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:44.720 align:middle line:84%
that you call "the sacred,
psilocybinetic pattern."

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And where it first
started was on a lamp.

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:50.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] And then what is this?

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:52.104 align:middle line:84%
And what was your
discovery through this?

00:44:52.104 --> 00:44:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: I don't
know what it is.

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And I took mushrooms
about four weeks ago,

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:58.970 align:middle line:90%
and it's an ongoing study.

00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:01.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I quoted out of your
book what you said it was,

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:03.981 align:middle line:84%
but we don't know what
that means exactly.

00:45:03.981 --> 00:45:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Well,
there's a tendency--

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.150 align:middle line:84%
I think most people
on psilocybin

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:09.640 align:middle line:90%
will experience patterns.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.710 align:middle line:90%
Patterns are interesting.

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:15.650 align:middle line:84%
If everything is interconnected,
and you perceive it directly,

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:17.690 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see
patterns to things.

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:18.770 align:middle line:90%
So that's not unusual.

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:20.240 align:middle line:90%
People see patterns.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:24.010 align:middle line:84%
But I started noticing a
particular, specific kind

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:25.910 align:middle line:90%
of pattern.

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:26.830 align:middle line:90%
And it was objective.

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:27.570 align:middle line:90%
It was real.

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was on the
surface of everything.

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And in the book, I come up
with two or three theories.

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:34.540 align:middle line:84%
I thought they're quite
good theories to account--

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, I'm going to
tell you what you called it,

00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:37.373 align:middle line:84%
just so people know what
we're talking about here,

00:45:37.373 --> 00:45:41.280 align:middle line:84%
"a membranous pattern of
interrelated information

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:42.900 align:middle line:90%
that covers everything."

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.325 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's very
vague but profound.

00:45:45.325 --> 00:45:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: Yeah.

00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:47.740 align:middle line:84%
The best way I
could describe it,

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:54.290 align:middle line:84%
it's like seeing an embroidered
membrane covering everything.

00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And what it was made of,
that embroidered membrane,

00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:59.690 align:middle line:90%
was the usual surface of things.

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:02.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not like it was
something extra I was seeing.

00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:05.020 align:middle line:84%
There's like a pattern
that I was seeing.

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.770 align:middle line:84%
It felt like I was
seeing a pattern that's

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:09.430 align:middle line:84%
covering everything that
you can't normally see.

00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And I like to think of
it as like the hallmark

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:12.490 align:middle line:90%
of interconnectedness.

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:16.040 align:middle line:84%
It just shows that
everything is interconnected.

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:22.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's something I'm-- three
people have contacted me since

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:25.670 align:middle line:84%
the book came out to say they've
experienced the same thing.

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:29.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's like an ongoing-- it's
just something I'm curious in.

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Fields of information
that connect everything?

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:32.350 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: Yes.

00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's like it can be directly
perceived as a pattern, almost

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:39.315 align:middle line:90%
like reality is like a fractal.

00:46:39.315 --> 00:46:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
look at a fractal,

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:42.290 align:middle line:90%
it's a beautiful pattern.

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:43.410 align:middle line:90%
You can go into it.

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:45.510 align:middle line:84%
There's loads of
details and spirals

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:47.260 align:middle line:84%
and filigree and all
this kind of thing.

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:48.762 align:middle line:90%
And it's all one pattern.

00:46:48.762 --> 00:46:50.470 align:middle line:84%
So I think with
psilocybin, it's like you

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:55.160 align:middle line:84%
can see your environment
as being very fractal-like

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:58.650 align:middle line:84%
and part of a single,
interconnected pattern.

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And it can be very
awesome and inspiring when

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:03.410 align:middle line:90%
you perceive that directly.

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:06.225 align:middle line:84%
And I often think it's got a
sacred quality to it as well,

00:47:06.225 --> 00:47:07.436 align:middle line:90%
and there's some sort of--

00:47:07.436 --> 00:47:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
it's fascinating.

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:11.115 align:middle line:84%
I mean, of course,
unless you experience it,

00:47:11.115 --> 00:47:13.860 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of difficult
to see or imagine

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:15.550 align:middle line:84%
exactly what you're
looking at, but I

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:18.030 align:middle line:90%
can understand it conceptually.

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:19.950 align:middle line:90%
And I thought it was profound.

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yeah, well, it remains
to be seen whether it's just

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:25.390 align:middle line:84%
me, just a few people,
or it's something

00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:26.650 align:middle line:90%
that other people can divine.

00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It starts coming up.

00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:29.081 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: It's very mysterious.

00:47:29.081 --> 00:47:31.925 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows what the
psilocybin experience

00:47:31.925 --> 00:47:35.100 align:middle line:84%
and these mystical states
of consciousness-- we

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:37.160 align:middle line:84%
don't even know what
consciousness is, really.

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:38.340 align:middle line:90%
So it's mysterious.

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And it would be
ridiculous to pretend

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:44.150 align:middle line:84%
to claim that you knew
what was going on.

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:45.640 align:middle line:90%
So it's just a mystery.

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the very
feeling of a mystery

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.960 align:middle line:84%
is the most important thing,
because many people don't sense

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.260 align:middle line:90%
the mystery of being anymore.

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:57.429 align:middle line:84%
So it's a good thing to
just feel directly and sense

00:47:57.429 --> 00:47:58.220 align:middle line:90%
this great mystery.

00:47:58.220 --> 00:47:59.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it may be beyond
the mental comprehension

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:01.100 align:middle line:84%
and in addition,
more fine than that.

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yeah, but
it's enough just

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.830 align:middle line:84%
to feel that
mystery, that there's

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:07.580 align:middle line:84%
a mystery with a
capital M. And that's

00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:10.380 align:middle line:90%
a great thing to feel that.

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:13.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in
defense of mushrooms,

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:16.820 align:middle line:84%
you've taken it all the
way to the House of Lords.

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And you wrote "The
Powell Report."

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:19.270 align:middle line:90%
Is that what it was called?

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:21.644 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yeah, "The Powell
Report" was a document, yeah.

00:48:21.644 --> 00:48:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: "The Powell Report"
that you wrote and submitted--

00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:28.470 align:middle line:84%
what was your hope as to
what would come out of that?

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And then what actually
came out of that?

00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:34.100 align:middle line:84%
You petitioned the British
government to say, look--

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Well, I was
clutching at straws.

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:40.140 align:middle line:84%
No way I was going
to have any effect.

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:44.220 align:middle line:84%
I did get mentioned in the
Hansard Records, or the written

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:45.577 align:middle line:90%
verbatim records of the talks.

00:48:45.577 --> 00:48:46.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Simon G. Powell.

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: It was in there.

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, "The Powell
Report" was mentioned twice

00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:51.570 align:middle line:90%
in the verbatim records.

00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:54.200 align:middle line:84%
But no, what
happened was in 2005,

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:58.090 align:middle line:84%
the UK government wanted to--
because there was a trade

00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:00.410 align:middle line:84%
in tropical
psilocybin mushrooms--

00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:02.200 align:middle line:84%
it was all over the
UK, and government--

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There were
being cultivated, right?

00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:05.536 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Cultivated
in the Netherlands,

00:49:05.536 --> 00:49:07.820 align:middle line:84%
I think, and being
sold everywhere.

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And rather than looking
into the impact-- I mean,

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:15.360 align:middle line:84%
a sensible reaction
to that would

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:19.629 align:middle line:84%
be to look at what's the effects
of that or hospitalizations,

00:49:19.629 --> 00:49:21.420 align:middle line:84%
people driven-- what's
the effects of this?

00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:22.610 align:middle line:84%
This has been going
on for two years.

00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:23.526 align:middle line:90%
Of course, they don't.

00:49:23.526 --> 00:49:25.550 align:middle line:90%
They just knee-jerk.

00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And so they wanted to stop this
commercial sale of psilocybin

00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:32.340 align:middle line:90%
mushrooms.

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And so they drew
up this new bill.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And that mean that the
wild mushroom would also

00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:40.760 align:middle line:90%
become illegal to possess.

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And that irked me,
because that had

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:48.090 align:middle line:84%
been unprecedented to
make a natural part

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:51.300 align:middle line:84%
of the British
landscape illegal.

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:55.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these mushrooms grow
on land owned by the queen.

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:57.330 align:middle line:84%
You can find them in
all the parks and stuff.

00:49:57.330 --> 00:50:03.850 align:middle line:84%
So to prohibit the possession
of a piece of natural fabric,

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:05.070 align:middle line:90%
it's insane.

00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:08.010 align:middle line:84%
That literally to
me is psychotic

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:10.650 align:middle line:84%
that you could have
something coming out of--

00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:12.750 align:middle line:84%
if you believe in God,
then God put them there,

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:15.555 align:middle line:84%
the idea that you can look
at this mushroom, touch it,

00:50:15.555 --> 00:50:17.360 align:middle line:84%
but if you pick it,
suddenly you could

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:18.820 align:middle line:90%
get seven years in prison.

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:22.030 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely insane that
we're that disconnected.

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so it irked me,
and I thought, well,

00:50:24.110 --> 00:50:25.484 align:middle line:90%
I've got to do something.

00:50:25.484 --> 00:50:27.400 align:middle line:84%
This is going through
Parliament and all that,

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:29.358 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to be
looking over my shoulder

00:50:29.358 --> 00:50:32.940 align:middle line:84%
when I'm picking mushrooms
out in Snowdonia or whatever.

00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:35.080 align:middle line:84%
So I sent some
information, because they

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:36.150 align:middle line:90%
didn't know anything.

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:38.840 align:middle line:90%


00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.340 align:middle line:84%
They make all these
changes to legislation

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:43.730 align:middle line:84%
without consulting any
scientist whatsoever.

00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:49.670 align:middle line:84%
So I managed to get
some written statements

00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:52.500 align:middle line:84%
from some scientists I'm
seeing tomorrow, actually,

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.610 align:middle line:84%
some Heffter Research
Institute scientists who

00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:56.340 align:middle line:90%
do psilocybin research.

00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Got them to talk about
psilocybin and Rick Doblin

00:50:58.990 --> 00:50:59.610 align:middle line:90%
from MAPS.

00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And I got all this
information just

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:05.690 align:middle line:84%
to inform these
rather naive sort

00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:11.300 align:middle line:84%
of granny-like, finger-wagging
nannies in Parliament.

00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:15.400 align:middle line:84%
But they shouldn't
just blanket prohibit.

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:18.650 align:middle line:84%
You need to control it
and license it and control

00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:21.280 align:middle line:84%
licensing and distribution
and that kind of thing.

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:24.330 align:middle line:84%
But at least look into it
and take scientific evidence.

00:51:24.330 --> 00:51:27.470 align:middle line:84%
You can't just, oh,
we don't like that,

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:32.240 align:middle line:84%
make it Class A. There's got
to be scientific evidence.

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And the scien-- all
the scientific evidence

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:37.110 align:middle line:84%
shows that psilocybin,
it might be strong,

00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:39.890 align:middle line:90%
but nobody dies from it.

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:42.409 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you're
healthy, it's OK.

00:51:42.409 --> 00:51:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Whereas you
have some stats here.

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:47.800 align:middle line:84%
One in 25 deaths globally
are alcohol-related.

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: Yeah, yeah.

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's relatively
safe, psilocybin.

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:53.770 align:middle line:84%
People confuse
strength with danger.

00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:54.690 align:middle line:90%
It's strong.

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:55.680 align:middle line:90%
It's not dangerous.

00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:58.920 align:middle line:90%
It's a strong substance.

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:00.920 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
misinformation and ignorance

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:01.620 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:03.661 align:middle line:84%
Any anyway, so yeah, I
petitioned the government,

00:52:03.661 --> 00:52:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and I sent this
report to everyone.

00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:07.000 align:middle line:90%
But it made no difference.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And now the fresh indigenous
psilocybin mushroom

00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:16.060 align:middle line:84%
is now in the UK as a Class A.
It's equivalent to Schedule 1.

00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:17.690 align:middle line:90%
So it's a ridiculous thing.

00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And like I say, that's
nature deficit disorder

00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:21.430 align:middle line:90%
in the extreme.

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:22.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:24.770 align:middle line:84%
But maybe as science
starts looking

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:28.732 align:middle line:84%
at the various properties and
the applications, that will

00:52:28.732 --> 00:52:29.940 align:middle line:90%
ultimately change, you think?

00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:31.045 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: It has to.

00:52:31.045 --> 00:52:33.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be interviewing
some people from the Heffter

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:35.250 align:middle line:90%
Research Institute tomorrow.

00:52:35.250 --> 00:52:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And the research they're
doing, the papers

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:42.660 align:middle line:84%
they've had published, they've
had peer-reviewed articles

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:43.785 align:middle line:90%
published.

00:52:43.785 --> 00:52:46.780 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the research is
going on at Johns Hopkins.

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's a respectable
university.

00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:50.455 align:middle line:84%
And they've been good
results, and there

00:52:50.455 --> 00:52:52.700 align:middle line:84%
are various ways
in which psilocybin

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:55.900 align:middle line:84%
is being used in a
therapeutic-- and so I think

00:52:55.900 --> 00:53:00.590 align:middle line:84%
the aim is the more papers, the
more research they come up with

00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:02.960 align:middle line:84%
and the more data
they have at hand,

00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:05.980 align:middle line:84%
then the authorities will
have no choice, really,

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:10.670 align:middle line:84%
but to reschedule psilocybin
in the light of that data.

00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:12.130 align:middle line:90%
Because you have to.

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:15.170 align:middle line:84%
You can't just ignore it
forever, same with cannabis,

00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:16.520 align:middle line:90%
I suppose.

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:17.870 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it legal now in--?

00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's legal.

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.600 align:middle line:84%
You can go down the
street into a store

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:21.016 align:middle line:84%
and pick some up
here in Colorado.

00:53:21.016 --> 00:53:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yeah, that would
have been unthinkable 10,

00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.660 align:middle line:90%
20 years ago.

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think about
that every now and then,

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:29.860 align:middle line:84%
of some pork guy who was
bringing hashish or cannabis

00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:33.490 align:middle line:84%
or something through, say,
Turkey, whose life is wasting

00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:35.900 align:middle line:84%
away in a prison cell
while people over here

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:38.360 align:middle line:84%
can go down to the corner
store and pick it up now.

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:39.410 align:middle line:90%
How sad that is that?

00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: It's just a
crazy-- the way humans

00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:47.420 align:middle line:84%
deal with psychoactive
substances

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:49.961 align:middle line:90%
is a very curious thing.

00:53:49.961 --> 00:53:50.710 align:middle line:90%
It's very curious.

00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:52.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
fear around it.

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:53.750 align:middle line:90%
There's fear and control.

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: Of certain substances.

00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:57.420 align:middle line:84%
Other ones that would have
a long tradition of use,

00:53:57.420 --> 00:54:00.730 align:middle line:84%
like alcohol,
tobacco, no problem.

00:54:00.730 --> 00:54:04.450 align:middle line:84%
But new, exotic things,
particularly if they facilitate

00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:08.580 align:middle line:84%
states of consciousness that
are unusual and different

00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:10.205 align:middle line:84%
to our normal states
of consciousness--

00:54:10.205 --> 00:54:11.246 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mind-expanding.

00:54:11.246 --> 00:54:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>>POWELL: Yes.

00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:16.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a fear of anything
new and of the unknown.

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Again, it gets back to
when you take psilocybin,

00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:22.900 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the
human unconscious that

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:24.200 align:middle line:90%
comes into conscious awareness.

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's like a
stranger to most people.

00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:26.930 align:middle line:90%
And we're afraid of it.

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And we want to keep
that like Pandora's box.

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.472 align:middle line:84%
We've got to be
afraid of ourselves.

00:54:31.472 --> 00:54:32.680 align:middle line:90%
We don't want self-knowledge.

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:33.472 align:middle line:90%
Keep it back there.

00:54:33.472 --> 00:54:35.596 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we just
have a couple minutes left.

00:54:35.596 --> 00:54:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And I have a couple
questions left for you.

00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:39.470 align:middle line:84%
One is, after
having done, as you

00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:43.450 align:middle line:84%
say, 140 or 150 different
psilocybin journeys

00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:47.530 align:middle line:84%
and experiences and experiencing
the great interconnected

00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:52.410 align:middle line:84%
and web and richness of life and
beautiful places in the world,

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:54.940 align:middle line:84%
how does it work for you
just then coming back

00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:56.500 align:middle line:90%
into the rather mundane world?

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Yeah,
it's very difficult,

00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:59.999 align:middle line:84%
particularly we
used to have chats

00:54:59.999 --> 00:55:02.290 align:middle line:84%
about this around the campfire
when we were coming down

00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:04.140 align:middle line:90%
from a mushroom voyage.

00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And then we'd be looking at the
Milky Way thinking about love

00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:10.530 align:middle line:84%
is the key and
everyone's got to know

00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:13.140 align:middle line:84%
about this potential, the
way that that communion

00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:17.950 align:middle line:84%
you can have with the universe,
the cosmos and the wonder

00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:22.596 align:middle line:84%
and the awe and the
thankfulness for being alive

00:55:22.596 --> 00:55:25.580 align:middle line:84%
and that huge providence
that we're part of.

00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:27.100 align:middle line:84%
You think, we've
go to share this,

00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and everyone will have
to down their weapons.

00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:31.567 align:middle line:84%
You can't have this
business as usual anymore.

00:55:31.567 --> 00:55:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And then we'd be thinking
about we have to go back

00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:35.290 align:middle line:90%
to London and, oh, no!

00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Gotta get on the tube,
gotta go to work the next day.

00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:39.380 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Polluted,
back to the city,

00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:41.800 align:middle line:84%
where you're worried about
paying your bills and all that.

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.424 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's very
difficult to integrate.

00:55:43.424 --> 00:55:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And so the real challenge
is to integrate.

00:55:47.070 --> 00:55:49.154 align:middle line:84%
And that's the period
of my life I'm in now,

00:55:49.154 --> 00:55:51.570 align:middle line:84%
is just trying to integrate
all this stuff and the lessons

00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:52.977 align:middle line:90%
that I've learned.

00:55:52.977 --> 00:55:54.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's my
last and final question.

00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:57.680 align:middle line:84%
What is the most profound
message or lesson

00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:00.110 align:middle line:90%
you've learned from psilocybin?

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:01.650 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: Well, I
have to be honest.

00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:05.290 align:middle line:84%
It would be nice to say love
is the key, because that is one

00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:07.830 align:middle line:90%
thing I've learned many times.

00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:12.540 align:middle line:84%
But the main thing I've got from
it is this-- my raison d'etre,

00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:14.710 align:middle line:84%
I think, my function,
is to provide

00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:21.390 align:middle line:84%
this natural intelligence
paradigm to try to create,

00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:27.270 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate a better
relationship between humanity

00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:28.790 align:middle line:90%
and the rest of the biosphere.

00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Because I think, like I said
earlier, our relationship,

00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:34.950 align:middle line:84%
the way we see the biosphere is
all skewed and it's all wrong.

00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And we have to see the life
on Earth in the right way,

00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and we have to acknowledge
that life is an intelligence.

00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:45.370 align:middle line:84%
So the greatest
lesson I've learned

00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:47.400 align:middle line:84%
is that natural
intelligence paradigm.

00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:51.409 align:middle line:84%
That's what I feel is
my job to promote that.

00:56:51.409 --> 00:56:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and you
do a beautiful job of it.

00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Your writing is
really very coherent,

00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:59.090 align:middle line:84%
considering the state you were
in while you wrote a lot of it,

00:56:59.090 --> 00:57:02.310 align:middle line:84%
and also very humorous
and self-effacing.

00:57:02.310 --> 00:57:03.510 align:middle line:90%
You've done a lovely job.

00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of bummed
out, because sometime earlier

00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:10.530 align:middle line:84%
this year, I had
this experience where

00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:13.032 align:middle line:84%
a friend who is into
essential oils said, hey,

00:57:13.032 --> 00:57:14.240 align:middle line:90%
have you ever tried this one?

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:16.180 align:middle line:90%
Put it right here-- palo santo.

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:18.750 align:middle line:84%
So I put it there, not
know anything about it.

00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:20.280 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't even looked
up what it was.

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:21.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's a root.

00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And that, within minutes,
took me down into the Earth

00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:28.680 align:middle line:84%
to the roots into
the world of fungi.

00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And the messages
that came out of that

00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:34.970 align:middle line:84%
were amazing, about
transmuting certain energies

00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:38.480 align:middle line:84%
between the human species
and the other species.

00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I lost it,
because I didn't

00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:43.490 align:middle line:84%
know how to file it in
my computer properly.

00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:45.500 align:middle line:84%
But I was excited
to meet with you,

00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:47.750 align:middle line:84%
because that was such
a profound feeling

00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:48.954 align:middle line:90%
and experience at that time.

00:57:48.954 --> 00:57:50.370 align:middle line:10%
>>POWELL: But it's
very difficult,

00:57:50.370 --> 00:57:53.200 align:middle line:10%
those entries in the
book from my diary

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:55.590 align:middle line:10%
while I was writing
directly under the influence

00:57:55.590 --> 00:57:56.770 align:middle line:10%
of psilocybin.

00:57:56.770 --> 00:57:59.790 align:middle line:10%
Like I said in the book,
it's like taking a chisel

00:57:59.790 --> 00:58:01.652 align:middle line:10%
and trying to-- it was
very, very difficult.

00:58:01.652 --> 00:58:02.902 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You did a great job.

00:58:02.902 --> 00:58:04.401 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: But I
found I could do it,

00:58:04.401 --> 00:58:06.920 align:middle line:84%
and I've still got the
original journals at home.

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:10.285 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of exclamation
marks that are everywhere--

00:58:10.285 --> 00:58:12.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHING] Yeah, you
edit it a bit for the book.

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.130 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, I want to thank you.

00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:16.449 align:middle line:84%
I know you're a little bit
shy of media and all this.

00:58:16.449 --> 00:58:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank
you for taking the time

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.650 align:middle line:84%
and coming and
sharing this message.

00:58:19.650 --> 00:58:20.900 align:middle line:84%
>>POWELL: I've
enjoyed it, so thanks

00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:22.190 align:middle line:90%
for having me on your show.
