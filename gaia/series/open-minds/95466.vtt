>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Marriage and partnership

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.956 align:middle line:10%
is perhaps the most challenging
aspect of everyday life,

00:00:09.956 --> 00:00:11.830 align:middle line:10%
but what if there were
essentially a handbook

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.010 align:middle line:10%
to each other's
care and well being

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.960 align:middle line:10%
so we're no longer
shooting in the dark?

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Author Nicolas David Ngan
says his soul contract

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.860 align:middle line:84%
work provides just
such insights.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.750 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:43.799 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Last time we gave a bit
of an introduction, which

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.890 align:middle line:84%
we need to kind of go back
and encapsulate that part

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.320 align:middle line:84%
to start with for people new
to you and new to the subject.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, our
last show was on walk-ins,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.610 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to see how
this subject, essentially,

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.470 align:middle line:84%
interlaces with
soul contract work.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.430 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, give us
an idea of the essence

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.590 align:middle line:84%
of how soul contract works--
looks to us, how we find out

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.069 align:middle line:84%
what our soul contract
is, and so on.

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NICOLAS DAVID NGAN: OK.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.068 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for having me on
the show again, Regina.

00:01:15.068 --> 00:01:20.960 align:middle line:10%
The essence of the soul contract
work is that sound is creative,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.040 align:middle line:10%
and the movement of a great
spirit created the universe.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.240 align:middle line:10%
And the movement in sounds of
our birth certificate names

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.970 align:middle line:10%
create our reality
in each moment

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.770 align:middle line:10%
through the law of attraction.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:84%
So if we take our
birth certificate name

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.140 align:middle line:84%
and we convert it to
phonetic ancient Hebrew,

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.980 align:middle line:84%
out of those sounds comes
22 different Hebrew numbers.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.130 align:middle line:10%
And from those, we can decode
the meaning of our lives

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.290 align:middle line:10%
using the Star of David.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.600 align:middle line:10%
And there's two aspects
we have in our lives--

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.600 align:middle line:10%
the physical aspect, which
is arriving on Earth,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.940 align:middle line:10%
getting grounded,
connecting to the world.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And the spiritual aspect,
which activates in our supposed

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.650 align:middle line:84%
mid-life crisis
between 30 and 40,

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.435 align:middle line:84%
and that's bringing our
spiritual mission online.

00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And within each of
those three aspects,

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.170 align:middle line:84%
we have what we call "karma,"
"talents," and "goals."

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And the karma is the
challenge we're here

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.540 align:middle line:84%
to transmute into our
gift of love and service

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.085 align:middle line:84%
on Earth through
using our talents.

00:02:18.085 --> 00:02:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And the goals will be
achieved when the talents are

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.210 align:middle line:84%
strong enough, both
in the physical

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.020 align:middle line:90%
and the spiritual aspects.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And the blending
of all six aspects

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.230 align:middle line:84%
produces our soul
destiny or life purpose,

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.420 align:middle line:84%
the real meaning
of why we're here.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a secret
spiritual map of life

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.225 align:middle line:90%
the soul's put in place.

00:02:35.225 --> 00:02:38.367 align:middle line:84%
And when we discover this,
and we align with it,

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:39.950 align:middle line:84%
which is why I wrote
my book about it,

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.980 align:middle line:84%
"Your Soul Contract
Decoded," then we

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.955 align:middle line:84%
can live a life of
more blissful flow

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:46.830 align:middle line:84%
rather than a live of struggle,
which most humans live.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.547 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now who created the
original soul contract work?

00:02:50.547 --> 00:02:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: My teacher,
Frank Alper, who's

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.690 align:middle line:90%
now passed over in Arizona.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.200 align:middle line:84%
He channeled this ancient
system through in the '80s.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And he brought the transmission
of it for the 22 Hebrew numbers

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.290 align:middle line:90%
through from the soul of Moses.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.630 align:middle line:84%
This is where it came from,
and I learned this back in 1990

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.290 align:middle line:90%
from him.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And when I got my
hands on it, it

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.330 align:middle line:84%
explained the disparate,
crazy experiences of my life.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.961 align:middle line:84%
I knew I had to learn this
and teach it and share it

00:03:18.961 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:90%
with people.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.254 align:middle line:84%
And I brought it to
the UK, and now I'm

00:03:21.254 --> 00:03:22.920 align:middle line:84%
trying to spread it
throughout the world

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.790 align:middle line:84%
so people can live
more fulfilling lives.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.467 align:middle line:84%
More harmonious lives
with others as well.

00:03:28.467 --> 00:03:30.800 align:middle line:84%
That's the part we're really
going to get into in a bit.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And you say that the soul
manifests its destiny

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.930 align:middle line:90%
in our DNA?

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yes.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Lipton wrote
a really good book

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.669 align:middle line:90%
about this, where he said--

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:43.085 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: "The
Biology of Belief?"

00:03:43.085 --> 00:03:45.550 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Yeah, he essentially
discovered scientifically

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.120 align:middle line:84%
that there were signals coming
from somewhere else that

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.370 align:middle line:90%
was influencing the DNA.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't hardwired
the way scientists

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.820 align:middle line:90%
had believed initially.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.010 align:middle line:84%
And so I take that
premise, what he's

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.870 align:middle line:84%
discovered, to the
next phase, which is,

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.710 align:middle line:84%
basically, it is
the soul's energy

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.400 align:middle line:84%
through the social contract,
which is creating the DNA

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.890 align:middle line:84%
and changing it in
situ as you grow.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And as you experience things,
things get programmed into it.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Because the soul is doing
that to create certain life

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.610 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And so we're very
fluid and malleable.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:84%
We start off with a
given soul contract,

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.406 align:middle line:84%
but that can actually adjust
through our life experience.

00:04:23.406 --> 00:04:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Because the soul doesn't
actually know what's

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.196 align:middle line:90%
going to happen fully.

00:04:26.196 --> 00:04:29.315 align:middle line:84%
It just sets a general direction
of potential experience.

00:04:29.315 --> 00:04:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And do you
notice that people

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.890 align:middle line:84%
who carry the same
name, whether it's

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.400 align:middle line:84%
the surname or the
first name, often

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.420 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of similar encoding
within their being when you

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.820 align:middle line:84%
read their soul contract
chart, for example?

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So if your name is Linda,
will Lindas, in general,

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.159 align:middle line:84%
carry a similar signature
or experience in there?

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: There will be
some common energies,

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.937 align:middle line:84%
because each letter in
L-I-N-D-A is the same.

00:04:59.937 --> 00:05:01.520 align:middle line:84%
So those frequencies
will be in there.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.657 align:middle line:84%
But that's actually the product,
the blending of the full name,

00:05:05.657 --> 00:05:07.990 align:middle line:84%
and decoding it on the Star
of David which will actually

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.835 align:middle line:84%
give their true life
of what's going on.

00:05:10.835 --> 00:05:11.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's interesting.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is going
off a little bit.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.890 align:middle line:84%
It's tangential,
but it just popped

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.630 align:middle line:84%
into mind, which is
why I asked that.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.600 align:middle line:84%
There was a woman
named Linda and I, who

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.120 align:middle line:84%
years ago, in this
little meditation group,

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.170 align:middle line:84%
did an experiment where
we closed our eyes,

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.950 align:middle line:84%
and someone else
would call out a name.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was always-- we
only worked with names.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And then with our hand, we
would, essentially, in the air,

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:84%
draw not the letters
but the feeling

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.070 align:middle line:90%
of that particular sound.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And with our eyes closed,
we were almost always

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.590 align:middle line:84%
identical in the
shapes that we drew

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle line:84%
for the sound that was
associated with a name.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's what made me
actually ask you that question.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, you're picking
up the pure vibration

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.833 align:middle line:84%
in your body, because
you're very sensitive,

00:06:01.833 --> 00:06:03.580 align:middle line:90%
is reacting to it.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.330 align:middle line:84%
Because each letter of a
name has a common frequency.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you're sensitive,
you'll translate it

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.120 align:middle line:84%
into some form of
energy in motion,

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.899 align:middle line:84%
because that is actually
energy in motion.

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it was
interesting and beautiful,

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.890 align:middle line:84%
because there were certain names
that had hard right angles.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And there were other
names that were

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.920 align:middle line:84%
a series of soft loops
or mounds and so forth.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And it was very clear, and
we did them spontaneously

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.730 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.500 align:middle line:84%
So that's what was coming
out in form-- sound and form

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.630 align:middle line:90%
in that sense.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, there's
several different categories

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.410 align:middle line:90%
of energy in a name.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:84%
There's, like, very
physical numbers

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.470 align:middle line:84%
and physical vibrations, very
spiritual ones, very creative

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.300 align:middle line:84%
ones, and very much
communication-orientated ones.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.740 align:middle line:84%
So the right angle
ones would have

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.735 align:middle line:90%
been more physical numbers.

00:06:50.735 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And then the more
curvy ones tend

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.160 align:middle line:84%
to be almost spiritual
flowing ones.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.850 align:middle line:90%
Because spirit flows in curves.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.830 align:middle line:84%
So you were just picking
up on the true essence

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:59.940 align:middle line:90%
of what's in that name.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, there were a
couple of names that I thought,

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.270 align:middle line:90%
ooh, that would hurt.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.186 align:middle line:90%
That would be painful.

00:07:03.186 --> 00:07:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Because it's almost like living
in a box, which you probably

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.570 align:middle line:84%
see sometimes in your
soul contract work.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Yeah, some people, if
they have a very rigid chart,

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.380 align:middle line:84%
a lot of physical energies
and they're very earthy

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.060 align:middle line:84%
experiences that they're
creating for themselves.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Whereas others are very
spiritual, very ethereal,

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.100 align:middle line:90%
barely here on Earth.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.689 align:middle line:84%
And a lot are
somewhere in between,

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:25.980 align:middle line:90%
depending on the stage of life.

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:26.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.030 align:middle line:84%
OK, so obviously, if
it's impacting one of us,

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.970 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
impacting all of us.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So I want to start diving into
the nature of relationships,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.120 align:middle line:84%
our relationships with others,
and how this plays out.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And having knowledge of
the soul contract chart

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:49.020 align:middle line:84%
can help us identify where our
strengths and our weaknesses

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.400 align:middle line:90%
are within relationships.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.870 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Your relationships tend
to be-- we're drawn to someone.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.595 align:middle line:84%
We're attracted at some
level, physical or emotional,

00:07:57.595 --> 00:08:00.020 align:middle line:84%
a bit of both, or
there's a soul pull,

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.440 align:middle line:84%
but we actually
don't know why we

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.210 align:middle line:84%
get tractor beamed
into something.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.652 align:middle line:84%
Things happen, especially
when we're younger.

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:07.360 align:middle line:84%
But actually, what
the soul contract work

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:13.270 align:middle line:84%
does is it opens up a very
transparent, very conscious way

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:17.200 align:middle line:84%
of understanding ourselves and
how we are in a relationship,

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.362 align:middle line:90%
and how our partner is.

00:08:19.362 --> 00:08:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is that
if we bring consciousness

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.530 align:middle line:84%
to all the seven
aspects of what's

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.030 align:middle line:84%
in us and in our
partner, we can then

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.116 align:middle line:84%
relate to them in a way that's
going to be more harmonious.

00:08:29.116 --> 00:08:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Because what
happens then, we can

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.520 align:middle line:84%
see where their karma
or their weaknesses are,

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.584 align:middle line:84%
and we can see where
their strengths are,

00:08:35.584 --> 00:08:37.929 align:middle line:84%
and we can then work
to support them and not

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:40.380 align:middle line:84%
tread on the real sensitive
parts, which many people have

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.929 align:middle line:90%
in their charts.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:43.809 align:middle line:84%
But what also
happens is that you

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:46.360 align:middle line:84%
can think of our
birth names, which

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.030 align:middle line:84%
is what we described
in the first show

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.450 align:middle line:90%
as like the cake of our life.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And every relationship we
have, whether it's love,

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.300 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a parent's
or sibling's, or we

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.390 align:middle line:84%
have a different name,
because most of us

00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:59.180 align:middle line:84%
don't use our birth
certificate name.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, we have
nicknames and so forth.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.189 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: That's like
a layer of icing

00:09:03.189 --> 00:09:06.215 align:middle line:84%
that goes on the cake of
very specific frequencies

00:09:06.215 --> 00:09:10.500 align:middle line:84%
that infuse into the seven
aspects of our soul contract.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And they have a--
each of those energies

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.164 align:middle line:84%
either has a positive,
negative, or neutral effect.

00:09:16.164 --> 00:09:17.830 align:middle line:84%
So when we're relating,
what's happening

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.990 align:middle line:84%
is the energy's transmitting
from our energy field.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:21.489 align:middle line:84%
So you and I were
in a relationship,

00:09:21.489 --> 00:09:23.630 align:middle line:84%
it'd be transmitting from
my fields to your fields

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.130 align:middle line:90%
to the adjacent aspect.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Like, my physical
karmic energy will

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.670 align:middle line:84%
go to your physical
karmic energy.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.385 align:middle line:84%
And then my physical
talents will

00:09:33.385 --> 00:09:36.730 align:middle line:84%
go to what we call your
physical talent gateway.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.380 align:middle line:84%
It would infuse
into your gateway,

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:84%
then it would go up
to your physical karma

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.150 align:middle line:90%
and down to your physical goals.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.620 align:middle line:84%
So if it's a good
match, you would

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.340 align:middle line:90%
want to grow, and open, expand.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.330 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes we have
a clash if we both have

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.020 align:middle line:84%
the same karmic pattern
and physical part.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.480 align:middle line:84%
So we both had 3s,
which are about feeling

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.340 align:middle line:90%
worthy to express.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.160 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is,
there'd be a clash.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we have the
conflict in relationships.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.480 align:middle line:84%
You and I would
feel like, I don't

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.160 align:middle line:90%
feel very loved around here.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.210 align:middle line:84%
But when we're away from
each other, oh, it's gone.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:14.704 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:10:14.704 --> 00:10:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now,
that's interesting.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.552 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
people experience

00:10:17.552 --> 00:10:20.730 align:middle line:84%
this, especially in their
personal relationships,

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.935 align:middle line:84%
where they have this internal
conflict all the time.

00:10:22.935 --> 00:10:24.310 align:middle line:84%
But then when
they're apart, they

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:25.514 align:middle line:90%
think fondly of each other.

00:10:25.514 --> 00:10:26.055 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:10:26.055 --> 00:10:27.471 align:middle line:84%
It's because they're
not in what I

00:10:27.471 --> 00:10:30.220 align:middle line:84%
call the cauldron of
karmic relating, which

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.050 align:middle line:84%
is how a lot of
initial relationships

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:36.676 align:middle line:84%
are to bring our
attention to our patterns.

00:10:36.676 --> 00:10:38.550 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
happens is, for example,

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:43.430 align:middle line:84%
if I had a-- say you had
physical karmic 7s, which

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.932 align:middle line:84%
are about healing
the heart and opening

00:10:46.932 --> 00:10:49.140 align:middle line:84%
to show your true feelings
and thoughts in the world.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.350 align:middle line:90%
And I had physical talent 7s.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.940 align:middle line:84%
My positive energy will go into
your physical talent gateway,

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.520 align:middle line:84%
up into your physical
karma, and it

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.580 align:middle line:90%
would help you heal the heart.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.612 align:middle line:90%
So that's called a karmic lock.

00:11:03.612 --> 00:11:05.570 align:middle line:84%
So that is actually what
draws people together.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:06.970 align:middle line:84%
That's actually the
tractor beam effect.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:08.222 align:middle line:90%
It actually pulls people--

00:11:08.222 --> 00:11:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what happens
when they're falling in love.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: A lot of the time,
we just get pulled in.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, what's happened?

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:15.070 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.120 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.427 align:middle line:84%
It's because you're getting
the positive frequency

00:11:18.427 --> 00:11:19.010 align:middle line:90%
that you need.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:20.530 align:middle line:90%
It's a perfect match.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And so you'll grow much
faster by going through that,

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.690 align:middle line:84%
but you have to feel your
way through a lot more

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.340 align:middle line:84%
of the negative karmic
issue initially.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.199 align:middle line:84%
But if you stay with
it, then you'll find,

00:11:32.199 --> 00:11:33.865 align:middle line:84%
I don't have that
feeling of heartbreak.

00:11:33.865 --> 00:11:37.587 align:middle line:84%
I actually feel more decisive,
which is what a 7 is all about.

00:11:37.587 --> 00:11:38.795 align:middle line:90%
I feel I want to show myself.

00:11:38.795 --> 00:11:41.374 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm opening,
and I feel safe.

00:11:41.374 --> 00:11:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And so those sort
of relationships

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:46.310 align:middle line:84%
are where people grow much
more rapidly than they would

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:84%
by themselves, because they're
getting this transmission 12

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:51.952 align:middle line:90%
hours out of seven days a week.

00:11:51.952 --> 00:11:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:55.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, now what happens when
you have people-- I mean,

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.450 align:middle line:84%
we've all been
through probably most

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:84%
of these phases, where you
just fall obsessively, madly

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.800 align:middle line:84%
in love, but it's
really not-- I mean,

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.800 align:middle line:84%
it's only there
to teach you, not

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.860 align:middle line:90%
necessarily there to please you.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about what's
kind of the dynamics of that?

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Yeah, I call these
the karmic cauldron type

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.530 align:middle line:90%
relationships.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Where we-- it's like we
can't help ourselves.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.290 align:middle line:84%
We get pulled in usually
by one or two karmic,

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:22.550 align:middle line:90%
or also goal locks, for example.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:25.480 align:middle line:84%
If I had a talent 8,
which is about grounding,

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.910 align:middle line:84%
and you had a goal 8,
we'd be drawn together

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.620 align:middle line:90%
to help ground you.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And the more locks you
have in the overlay charts,

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.709 align:middle line:90%
the tighter the energy is.

00:12:34.709 --> 00:12:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's very hard to
escape, because you're just

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.250 align:middle line:84%
magnetically bolted
to each other.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
then is that you're

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.450 align:middle line:90%
doing what I call a karma.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And part of us feels, I know
this is not good for me.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:48.520 align:middle line:90%
In fact, what am I doing here?

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.189 align:middle line:84%
And I've had clients say to
me, I walked down the aisle,

00:12:51.189 --> 00:12:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and I knew I shouldn't
be doing this,

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:53.859 align:middle line:90%
but I couldn't help myself.

00:12:53.859 --> 00:12:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I've done that.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.380 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: It's like,
what happened?

00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And then 5, 10 years
later-- two kids.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:01.320 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this anymore.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:90%
It's killing me.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.080 align:middle line:84%
But I've grown enormously
in the process, you see?

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.288 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So this is
what creates it.

00:13:07.288 --> 00:13:09.070 align:middle line:90%
And the soul pre-planned this.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a pre-contractual,
pre-birth arrangement.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually often
nothing you can do about it.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:16.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, there isn't.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.670 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like you're
hypnotically walking right

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.450 align:middle line:84%
toward it, whether
it feels good or not.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And I did that in one
case when I was young.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.230 align:middle line:84%
It was the first
time I was married.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And I had you do-- after
our last interview,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.180 align:middle line:84%
I had you do a soul
contract reading for me,

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.280 align:middle line:90%
and included that person in it.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And as it showed up, it was
exactly what my experience

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.000 align:middle line:84%
was, which I am forever
grateful to him,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.250 align:middle line:84%
because it was kind of like
living with a drill sergeant.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:49.250 align:middle line:84%
I was going to get on my media
path, and really stick on it,

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and build from that,
which really had a lot

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.790 align:middle line:84%
to do with the nature of
that karmic cauldron that

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:57.270 align:middle line:84%
was very intensely
uncomfortable.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.970 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't have
changed that for anything.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.070 align:middle line:84%
So much good came out
of it on many levels,

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:03.870 align:middle line:90%
and we remained friends.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Many people who
get in the karmic cauldron

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:08.897 align:middle line:84%
then divorce and
eject their way out,

00:14:08.897 --> 00:14:10.230 align:middle line:90%
feel I shouldn't have done that.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.690 align:middle line:90%
I've wasted 10 years of my life.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
regret, but actually they

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.050 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be where they
are today without it.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had a
similar experience

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:24.040 align:middle line:84%
with Ahlmeirah, who
developed this work with me.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.740 align:middle line:90%
We were married for eight years.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.250 align:middle line:84%
We had clashing
spiritual karmic 9.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:33.020 align:middle line:84%
So we would really trigger
both our disempowerment issues

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.110 align:middle line:90%
from childhood.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:36.020 align:middle line:90%
And it was very intense.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.290 align:middle line:84%
But actually we realized
this, and so it actually

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:41.200 align:middle line:84%
got us both to
consciously engage

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.530 align:middle line:90%
with our deep disempowerment.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And when we divorced-- we
separated about six years ago,

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:51.540 align:middle line:84%
but the result of it is both
of us have come into our power.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.580 align:middle line:84%
We actually overcame the second
most challenging karmic pattern

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.480 align:middle line:90%
you could have while embodied.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.910 align:middle line:84%
But without that relationship,
which I'm really grateful for,

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.050 align:middle line:84%
I could not be doing
what I do today.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this
really requires

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.810 align:middle line:84%
taking-- because we
are going to be talking

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:09.840 align:middle line:84%
about some specific
relationships-- it really

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.670 align:middle line:84%
requires taking the
judgment out of the duration

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.140 align:middle line:90%
of any commitment.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yes.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because this so
passe is to say, oh, well,

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.200 align:middle line:84%
I was with him for however
long and we failed.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.910 align:middle line:84%
It didn't work out because you
didn't remain, quote, happily

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:27.680 align:middle line:84%
ever after, which very
few people do anyway.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And so I just want to put
that in that this requires

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:35.540 align:middle line:84%
growing up and saying, we're
in relationships for a purpose

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:40.100 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps for a particular
growth and not any reason

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.930 align:middle line:90%
beyond that.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:42.497 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yes.

00:15:42.497 --> 00:15:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, the happily ever
after is a Hollywood thing.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.230 align:middle line:84%
But you don't see
many Hollywood movies

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:48.580 align:middle line:84%
which say what happens
after you get married?

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.650 align:middle line:90%
I've seen one.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.459 align:middle line:84%
I saw one the other month, but
I thought, this is really new.

00:15:52.459 --> 00:15:54.500 align:middle line:84%
You never see this normally
in romantic comedies.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.499 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:55.499 --> 00:15:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: See?

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.630 align:middle line:84%
So I sort of watch
what's going on

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:02.600 align:middle line:84%
with how the consensus is
reacting to these situations.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's about
being in the moment

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and having no judgment
on what happens, but also

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.335 align:middle line:84%
that the soul has a specific
pathway in terms of relating.

00:16:12.335 --> 00:16:14.710 align:middle line:84%
It's actually made all these
pre-incarnational agreements

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:15.626 align:middle line:90%
with different people.

00:16:15.626 --> 00:16:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.492 align:middle line:84%
Pre-incarnation, this is
really key to remember.

00:16:19.492 --> 00:16:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: And so it's OK.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:22.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, we go in, and
we're programmed

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.280 align:middle line:90%
for happily ever after.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.580 align:middle line:84%
We discover it's not
so happily ever after.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.660 align:middle line:84%
We get to the point we
can't do it anymore,

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.960 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually about
being in our truth.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.701 align:middle line:84%
And it's most challenging
with children, especially.

00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Because we want to stay in
as long as possible to look

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.650 align:middle line:84%
after the children,
but actually,

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.541 align:middle line:90%
we want to be in our truth.

00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:41.040 align:middle line:84%
The soul wants us
to be in our truth

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:45.360 align:middle line:84%
and then separate and take the
lessons that come from that.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.965 align:middle line:84%
And then we need to reintegrate
ourselves, rediscover

00:16:49.965 --> 00:16:51.590 align:middle line:84%
ourselves, as you
might have discovered

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:54.380 align:middle line:84%
after getting separated
the first time.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.370 align:middle line:84%
We often get lost
in relationship

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:02.380 align:middle line:84%
because our soul was seeking
the love of god, of all

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.720 align:middle line:90%
that is, where we came from.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.670 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
what we're seeking.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're seeking that.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.920 align:middle line:84%
We're always seeking that
warmth, I mean, every human.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.399 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that unity, yes.

00:17:09.399 --> 00:17:11.371 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: And then we
will sacrifice ourselves

00:17:11.371 --> 00:17:13.329 align:middle line:84%
and do all sorts of
strange things to get that.

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And when we come out of it,
we realize, I've lost myself.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.510 align:middle line:84%
We often lose our
sense of identity

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:22.410 align:middle line:84%
because we're straying
so much from our truth.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually about
rebuilding ourselves

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:27.250 align:middle line:84%
and realizing what
the gifts were.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And that can take
several years minimum.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.000 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: At least from my
experience of being divorced.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.970 align:middle line:84%
But then what happens
is that we get ready

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:40.720 align:middle line:84%
for the next
relationship, obviously,

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.760 align:middle line:84%
a lot more cautiously and
a lot more consciously

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.030 align:middle line:90%
if we're on the path.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:47.450 align:middle line:84%
But then actually what happens
is that our ego feels, oh, no.

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:48.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.348 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be another one.

00:17:49.348 --> 00:17:50.285 align:middle line:90%
I can't do that again.

00:17:50.285 --> 00:17:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can't have
another failure.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:51.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Can't have
another failure.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.295 align:middle line:84%
I can't have another
cauldron type relationship.

00:17:54.295 --> 00:17:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And we may have
it, if we haven't

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.680 align:middle line:84%
got enough of the lesson
from the first one.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.290 align:middle line:84%
But often people get surprised
and have something completely

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:01.910 align:middle line:84%
different if they're
got the lessons.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:03.451 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
oftentimes people

00:18:03.451 --> 00:18:07.070 align:middle line:84%
do tend to draw to them the
same kind of experience.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:09.685 align:middle line:84%
Which makes perfect sense
if you didn't complete it

00:18:09.685 --> 00:18:10.601 align:middle line:90%
the first time around.

00:18:10.601 --> 00:18:11.625 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: If you didn't
finish it the first time,

00:18:11.625 --> 00:18:13.100 align:middle line:90%
I suppose it's round two.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.900 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:19.410 align:middle line:84%
So the main thing is to be-- if
you're in a relationship where

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.440 align:middle line:84%
it's very intense, and
you know a lot of it

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.732 align:middle line:84%
doesn't appear to be
good for you, just

00:18:25.732 --> 00:18:28.300 align:middle line:84%
to bring as much consciousness
to the issues and work on them

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.040 align:middle line:90%
within yourself.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.070 align:middle line:84%
You can't change your partner,
but you can change yourself.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.830 align:middle line:84%
But with this work,
if you understand

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:36.400 align:middle line:84%
what the core
issue is-- mine was

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.910 align:middle line:84%
disempowerment and unworthiness
to be loved-- if you work

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.690 align:middle line:84%
on that enough,
then what happens

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:43.865 align:middle line:84%
is your partner
starts to change.

00:18:43.865 --> 00:18:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you come in
fully to your power,

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:47.140 align:middle line:84%
then they stop
rearranging around

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.815 align:middle line:84%
your problem of
being disempowered.

00:18:48.815 --> 00:18:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And then actually what
happens after a while,

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.140 align:middle line:84%
they seem to be a
completely different person.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And you can't quite
understand why,

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.140 align:middle line:84%
but actually it's because
you got the lesson.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.742 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they're not
triggering those issues in you

00:18:57.742 --> 00:18:58.095 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:18:58.095 --> 00:19:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: And they're not
triggering the issue anymore.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Ahlmeirah and I,
we're best friends now.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's very rare for
us to trigger the issue,

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.130 align:middle line:84%
because we both
really worked on it.

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:08.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
have your chart here.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And the two of you with
your birth name and then the

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:16.860 align:middle line:84%
name that you changed your
names to, spelling-wise,

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.790 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get a
different kind of effect.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:22.070 align:middle line:84%
So we can just put this up
on the screen really briefly.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:24.050 align:middle line:84%
We see here over
on the left, that's

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:28.220 align:middle line:84%
you, your birth name, the name
you chose to adjust it to.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.229 align:middle line:90%
And then-- is it called Amel?

00:19:30.229 --> 00:19:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Amel.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Yes, this is the
French phonetics.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, Amel.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And then the name that she
chose to create in order

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:43.880 align:middle line:84%
to get the optimized frequencies
for the lesson she needs,

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.530 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.610 align:middle line:90%
So tell us about this dynamic.

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:48.670 align:middle line:90%
You told us a little bit ago.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little more
about this dynamic.

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: OK.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:54.685 align:middle line:84%
So in this chart here, in column
1 and 3, there are birth names.

00:19:54.685 --> 00:19:56.680 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
those initially.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:02.530 align:middle line:84%
The key thing here is that
Ahlmeirah in the column 3,

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:04.407 align:middle line:84%
in the physical talents,
has a 3-3, which

00:20:04.407 --> 00:20:06.490 align:middle line:84%
is about having a master
teacher and communicator,

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:09.100 align:middle line:84%
and being worthy to
express deep soul wisdom.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.900 align:middle line:90%
And she's a brilliant teacher.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:16.340 align:middle line:84%
So that goes across to my
17-8, physical talent gateway.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:19.210 align:middle line:84%
It goes up to my negative
3, which is, basically,

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:21.650 align:middle line:84%
feeling unworthy to
show myself, feeling

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:22.724 align:middle line:90%
not good enough to teach.

00:20:22.724 --> 00:20:23.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't know anything.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.431 align:middle line:90%
That sort of thing.

00:20:24.431 --> 00:20:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So did you
feel disempowered

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.060 align:middle line:90%
a lot in the relationship?

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.740 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: I did.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:33.430 align:middle line:84%
She was, initially-- she's a
natural teacher, and I wasn't.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And so this was actually
my teaching ground.

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:39.240 align:middle line:90%
She taught me how to teach.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And I gradually-- as this
burnt through my unworthiness,

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:45.260 align:middle line:84%
I always felt like I was on the
back foot in terms of teaching,

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.945 align:middle line:84%
because she was a
more natural teacher.

00:20:46.945 --> 00:20:49.220 align:middle line:84%
That actually brought me
up to speed as a teacher

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.450 align:middle line:84%
to do what I do now,
and a communicator.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:54.930 align:middle line:84%
But it took 18 years to
burn that one through,

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:57.145 align:middle line:90%
but that's called a karmic lock.

00:20:57.145 --> 00:20:59.850 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the things
that drew us together

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:01.500 align:middle line:84%
so I could work on
that issue, and we

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.157 align:middle line:84%
had a contract to
actually do that.

00:21:04.157 --> 00:21:06.490 align:middle line:84%
So we were going to meet
regardless, because we actually

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.073 align:middle line:84%
discovered that there were three
different places in the world

00:21:09.073 --> 00:21:11.685 align:middle line:84%
we could have met that
we both wanted to go to.

00:21:11.685 --> 00:21:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Like, we were going to
meet either in England

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.707 align:middle line:90%
or Japan or Australasia.

00:21:15.707 --> 00:21:18.040 align:middle line:84%
The spirit had planned that
there were some backup plans

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.160 align:middle line:84%
if we didn't meet--
which we met in England.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.059 align:middle line:84%
So it was all carefully
designed with us.

00:21:25.059 --> 00:21:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
that happens here

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.520 align:middle line:84%
is that the-- her 7s in
physical karma, which

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.560 align:middle line:84%
are about opening the heart
and becoming one person,

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.960 align:middle line:84%
they go across to my 3, and
they bring the hidden part of me

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.810 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.470 align:middle line:84%
So I always wanted to
hide away from everybody.

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:41.680 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to be seen.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she
wouldn't let you hide.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: I couldn't hide.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.060 align:middle line:90%
I had to come out, show myself.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And the other strong
pattern is the double 9s

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.155 align:middle line:84%
I just mentioned before
in the spiritual karma.

00:21:53.155 --> 00:21:54.530 align:middle line:84%
That's the most
powerful pattern.

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Over on your
column on the left.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:56.720 align:middle line:90%
OK, 9s.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.080 align:middle line:90%
Oh goodness, look at that.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: She's got
the same 9s in her--

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.695 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What?

00:22:00.695 --> 00:22:01.789 align:middle line:90%
Is that you call a lock?

00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:03.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: No, that's
actually called a clash.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:03.875 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A clash?

00:22:03.875 --> 00:22:05.125 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: That's a karmic clash.

00:22:05.125 --> 00:22:06.450 align:middle line:90%
That's where you go like this.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, really?

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.170 align:middle line:90%
Too much of the same thing?

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Yeah, because,
basically, it's

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:11.790 align:middle line:90%
a dissonant frequency.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens there
is that it will bring out

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.890 align:middle line:90%
our dark side, our shadow.

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Because the soul brings
in lots of-- in this case,

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:19.948 align:middle line:90%
this is disempowerment.

00:22:19.948 --> 00:22:21.840 align:middle line:84%
It brings a lot of
past life shadow

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.080 align:middle line:90%
energies of misuse of power.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And so it will bring layers of
it out over time for both of us

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:29.170 align:middle line:90%
to look at.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And so we're aware
of it, but it's

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.740 align:middle line:84%
like having two negative
poles on a magnet

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.010 align:middle line:90%
repulsing each other.

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:40.014 align:middle line:84%
It's very uncomfortable, but
that karmic friction, actually,

00:22:40.014 --> 00:22:41.930 align:middle line:84%
if you know what's going
on in a relationship,

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:45.990 align:middle line:84%
is actually a very
powerful place of growth

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:47.130 align:middle line:90%
if you can work with it.

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:48.796 align:middle line:84%
But it is uncomfortable,
but it's there,

00:22:48.796 --> 00:22:49.954 align:middle line:90%
so it gets your attention.

00:22:49.954 --> 00:22:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And you can do
nothing, but you've

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:54.990 align:middle line:84%
got to either work with it,
or you have to separate.

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:56.642 align:middle line:90%
That's the way it seems to work.

00:22:56.642 --> 00:22:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Or suffer is the
other alternative.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:58.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or suffer.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:22:59.125 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:22:59.125 --> 00:22:59.550 align:middle line:90%
That's the third alternative.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
the nice thing is

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:02.400 align:middle line:84%
there's no judgment
in any of this.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.470 align:middle line:84%
These are just human
and soul dynamics.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: This is just the
way our souls built it

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.330 align:middle line:84%
so we could actually
have this experience.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:12.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And now is there anything
else on that one with Amel?

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: The key
thing I'd say here

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:24.740 align:middle line:84%
is that our birth chart
names, it's not usually

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:28.740 align:middle line:84%
a good idea to use them
in everyday common usage.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Simply because this reinforces
our karmic patterns.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.530 align:middle line:84%
So the process that
we undertook here

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:84%
was one called
name optimization.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.475 align:middle line:84%
It's where the soul actually
has an optimal layer

00:23:39.475 --> 00:23:41.860 align:middle line:84%
of icing which is
already designed,

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.870 align:middle line:84%
which at the right time
we can become aware of.

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.610 align:middle line:84%
Which is what you see
in column 2 for me,

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:47.881 align:middle line:90%
and column 4 for Ahlmeirah.

00:23:47.881 --> 00:23:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you changed your
middle name from Guy to David?

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what was the
process of having done that?

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: The process
of this is designed

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.800 align:middle line:84%
to help me work through
the karmic patterns,

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:01.250 align:middle line:84%
bring my-- ground my
spiritual part of my chart

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:02.580 align:middle line:90%
and bring my mission online.

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.538 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But how did
you figure out that name?

00:24:04.538 --> 00:24:06.810 align:middle line:84%
Did you have to go
through a process?

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:09.139 align:middle line:90%
Some kind of a computer?

00:24:09.139 --> 00:24:11.430 align:middle line:84%
The process of entering the
data in the computer and it

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:13.390 align:middle line:84%
spits out the best
or most ideal one?

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:14.790 align:middle line:90%
Or is it more intuitive?

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:15.790 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:18.365 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: What we do is
that, at the right time,

00:24:18.365 --> 00:24:20.490 align:middle line:84%
there's a feeling when you
know about this process.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:23.750 align:middle line:84%
It's time for the name, because
the soul's giving me a push.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:26.735 align:middle line:84%
And it took about two
years, and it was like, OK,

00:24:26.735 --> 00:24:27.610 align:middle line:90%
it's time to do this.

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:30.630 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote out all
my key objectives.

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Because you have
to have done enough

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.840 align:middle line:84%
spiritual work and healing
to be ready to access that.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.970 align:middle line:84%
So I let out all my life
and spiritual objectives,

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:39.930 align:middle line:84%
which are one and
the same thing.

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And I said to great
spirit, in meditation,

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:45.480 align:middle line:84%
give me a name that's
going to help me get there.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.935 align:middle line:84%
And so we tried every crazy
Hebrew name you could come up

00:24:48.935 --> 00:24:51.310 align:middle line:84%
with, all the really long
biblical ones, and none of them

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:51.809 align:middle line:90%
worked.

00:24:51.809 --> 00:24:53.694 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought,
oh, it's not working.

00:24:53.694 --> 00:24:54.360 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And then-- the universe talks
to you when this happens.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And so a client wrote
to me and called me

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:03.327 align:middle line:84%
David twice in two
weeks in correspondence.

00:25:03.327 --> 00:25:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And so when that happens,
you pay attention.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.850 align:middle line:90%
When you sip the energy of this.

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:07.580 align:middle line:90%
Here's my goals.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:08.430 align:middle line:90%
This is what I want.

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And the universe
says here it is.

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.470 align:middle line:84%
If you just listen,
we'll tell you.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.130 align:middle line:84%
So we tried David, and we
looked at it, Ahlmeirah and I.

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was like,
oh, it's perfect.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.940 align:middle line:90%
So I'll explain what it does.

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:23.810 align:middle line:84%
The 7's out front
to magnetically

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:27.439 align:middle line:84%
draw to me the people, and
situations, and opportunities

00:25:27.439 --> 00:25:29.480 align:middle line:84%
to carry out my mission,
which is to help wake up

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.852 align:middle line:84%
as many people as possible,
which is why I do this work.

00:25:32.852 --> 00:25:34.435 align:middle line:84%
They continue the
theme that Ahlmeirah

00:25:34.435 --> 00:25:39.807 align:middle line:84%
was infusing into me of
bringing the depth of me out.

00:25:39.807 --> 00:25:41.640 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of fun
doing these interviews,

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.401 align:middle line:84%
and it brings a huge amount
of depth of what I know.

00:25:44.401 --> 00:25:46.526 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what I'm going
to say when we do this,

00:25:46.526 --> 00:25:47.401 align:middle line:90%
but it brings it out.

00:25:47.401 --> 00:25:48.980 align:middle line:90%
This is what this name does.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the 13-4 which
is the divine feminine, which

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.740 align:middle line:84%
is the issue I had
for my entire life,

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.990 align:middle line:84%
which is feeling disconnected
from the feminine aspect

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:58.260 align:middle line:84%
of God, especially
with my mother.

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And so the deepest wound now
becomes the greatest gift.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So by simply
changing your name,

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:05.940 align:middle line:84%
you start shifting
those frequencies?

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.292 align:middle line:84%
But you have to know
when and which name?

00:26:08.292 --> 00:26:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: You have to know--
if you get it wrong,

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:11.284 align:middle line:90%
it can make it worse.

00:26:11.284 --> 00:26:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:14.325 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Yeah, so you need an
experienced practitioner who

00:26:14.325 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:84%
knows what they're
doing to do this.

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.030 align:middle line:84%
So the 13 is bringing
the divine feminine in.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.950 align:middle line:84%
It creates a lot of
flow, a lot of trust.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:23.050 align:middle line:84%
I used to be very--
being male, I

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:24.660 align:middle line:84%
used to try to work
it all out, having

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.870 align:middle line:84%
been in the corporate
world, make it happen.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:28.540 align:middle line:84%
But now what I do
is, I just have

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:29.990 align:middle line:90%
a feeling of what is right.

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:32.570 align:middle line:84%
I put it out there, which is
what with divine feminine does.

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And I surrender and let it
go, and trust it will happen.

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And then it does
if I totally trust.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And the 22-4 is about
accessing source and bringing

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:46.190 align:middle line:84%
through a wide range of
information and tools

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:48.290 align:middle line:90%
to share with the world.

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And then what they
did is they put

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:53.700 align:middle line:84%
these 17-8s in spiritual
karma spiritual talents, which

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.870 align:middle line:84%
is grounding what I
do and bringing it

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:58.848 align:middle line:84%
across to a wide range
of people in society.

00:26:58.848 --> 00:27:00.723 align:middle line:84%
And it's in the spiritual
part of that chart.

00:27:00.723 --> 00:27:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And it goes to ground
my 9s in my birth

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:06.490 align:middle line:84%
chart, spiritual karma,
which is my channel.

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And it grounds source
coming through me,

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:10.394 align:middle line:90%
the 22-4 in the birth chart.

00:27:10.394 --> 00:27:11.810 align:middle line:84%
But then they put
a five in, which

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:13.770 align:middle line:84%
is a very etheric,
pioneering energy.

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:16.210 align:middle line:84%
So I like doing
cutting edge stuff.

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:17.940 align:middle line:84%
So it kept it
interesting for me.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cutting edge, yes.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: And then it produced
a 9 at the bottom, which

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.710 align:middle line:84%
says, OK, you're still going
to come into your power

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:26.684 align:middle line:90%
as a result of that.

00:27:26.684 --> 00:27:27.850 align:middle line:90%
So that's what that's about.

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:29.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a very elegant process.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.750 align:middle line:84%
It's like a dance
of spirit when we

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:31.958 align:middle line:90%
work with someone to do this.

00:27:31.958 --> 00:27:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And she changed her
name, and things

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:36.520 align:middle line:90%
started lining up on her side.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.910 align:middle line:84%
But you both
recognized that this

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:40.980 align:middle line:84%
wasn't a relationship
you needed to stay in,

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.814 align:middle line:84%
because you had attained
those goals, right?

00:27:42.814 --> 00:27:45.229 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, we got to a point
where we sat down one day.

00:27:45.229 --> 00:27:45.920 align:middle line:90%
We need to talk.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.060 align:middle line:84%
One of those real
serious conversations.

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And we both said
it's not working.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:51.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:54.890 align:middle line:84%
But we both consciously
acknowledged that.

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And then we consciously divorced
without all the conflict

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:02.341 align:middle line:84%
that most people have,
because people's ego

00:28:02.341 --> 00:28:03.840 align:middle line:84%
gets attached to
happily ever after.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And you didn't give
me happily ever after,

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:07.650 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to
come and get you.

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, this was like,
we've got our lessons.

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.720 align:middle line:90%
It's been very challenging.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.850 align:middle line:90%
But we've grown enormously.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:15.577 align:middle line:90%
Now let's detach consciously.

00:28:15.577 --> 00:28:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's
how it should be done.

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:19.520 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Because we
have a child as well.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people use
their children as weapons,

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.550 align:middle line:84%
because the ego's so upset
about what's happened.

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:26.515 align:middle line:84%
But we said that is
not going to happen.

00:28:26.515 --> 00:28:28.140 align:middle line:84%
We'll do this
consciously for his sake.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:29.560 align:middle line:90%
He was seven.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, there's
a lot less scarring

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.060 align:middle line:84%
for the children, especially
the very sensitive children

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.330 align:middle line:90%
we have nowadays.

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And we're still best friends,
and we both got what we needed.

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:41.765 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:41.765 --> 00:28:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: And this allows
you to see when it's done.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Because you can see
have I got my lessons?

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.220 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.610 align:middle line:90%
There's no more.

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:50.242 align:middle line:90%
Then it's time to depart.

00:28:50.242 --> 00:28:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's just the part
of the flow of spirit.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And then we move onto
the next phase of life.

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so then
we have the next chart,

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.250 align:middle line:90%
which is a woman friend.

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And we're not going to
put her name in there.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.590 align:middle line:84%
But what is the difference
in this dynamic?

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.300 align:middle line:90%
Because here you have the 3s.

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.550 align:middle line:84%
That's your first name
again, and now your 7s.

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:13.330 align:middle line:84%
So how does this
line up with her?

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, what happened
was that I was very scared

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:19.480 align:middle line:84%
of engaging in any form of
friendship or relationship,

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.720 align:middle line:84%
simply because of having had
this really karmic-- almost

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.580 align:middle line:90%
karmic intensity with Ahlmeirah.

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:29.460 align:middle line:84%
But then what
happens is the time

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.880 align:middle line:84%
came to get back
out in the world

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.890 align:middle line:84%
after about two or three
years of licking my wounds

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:35.940 align:middle line:84%
and recovering
and finding myself

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.420 align:middle line:84%
again after being
divorced or separated.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I manifested
a lovely friend here,

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:45.370 align:middle line:84%
who I have a very
close friendship with.

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:49.690 align:middle line:84%
But she actually showed me
what the feminine could be.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Whereas this was someone
who's very unconditional,

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:55.560 align:middle line:84%
just accepted me
exactly as I was.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And because she's got
the 13-4 in soul destiny,

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:00.730 align:middle line:84%
and so in the end,
actually, I discovered

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:03.500 align:middle line:84%
this is the woman who just
accepts me exactly as I am,

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.050 align:middle line:90%
so I can be myself.

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:08.725 align:middle line:10%
I can be true to
me, and eventually I

00:30:08.725 --> 00:30:10.600 align:middle line:10%
got to the point of
saying whatever I wanted,

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.950 align:middle line:10%
what was true.

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And actually we be both created
enormous safety for ourselves.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Because she had just left a
very difficult relationship.

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:22.410 align:middle line:84%
So we actually helped
heal each other.

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually
a process of coming

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:28.160 align:middle line:90%
to trusting the other gender.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.710 align:middle line:90%
And we've both got kids as well.

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:32.590 align:middle line:84%
So you're obviously
very careful there.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened here was
that we both got to a point

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.180 align:middle line:84%
where we're now ready
to actually go out

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:41.320 align:middle line:84%
and go deeper into a love
relationship with someone else,

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.430 align:middle line:84%
because we rebuilt trust, and
we've done a lot of healing,

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:46.060 align:middle line:84%
and we actually
learned a lot more

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:49.780 align:middle line:84%
about how the other sex actually
works in a safe environment.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very
strong experience.

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:54.140 align:middle line:84%
It's something I
hadn't expected,

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:59.462 align:middle line:84%
but the universe provided
enough components

00:30:59.462 --> 00:31:01.420 align:middle line:84%
in each other's contract
that we could actually

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.830 align:middle line:90%
work on our issues.

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, what about
some of your other clients

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:08.370 align:middle line:84%
you've had, and
some really dramatic

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:10.510 align:middle line:90%
overlays of their relationship?

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And say, changing the name
of one or both of them

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:16.880 align:middle line:84%
while they were in
the relationship

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.080 align:middle line:84%
and it actually
strengthened and flourished

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.334 align:middle line:90%
instead of splitting apart?

00:31:21.334 --> 00:31:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: When you're actually
optimizing a name, as we just

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:25.410 align:middle line:84%
described, we don't
optimize it just

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:27.480 align:middle line:90%
for the client's birth name.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.392 align:middle line:84%
You look at the whole
immediate family dynamic.

00:31:30.392 --> 00:31:31.475 align:middle line:90%
You look at their partner.

00:31:31.475 --> 00:31:33.782 align:middle line:84%
You say, OK, what are
the partner's issues?

00:31:33.782 --> 00:31:36.240 align:middle line:84%
So we design the name so that
it helps the partner as well.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And if there are kids,
we design the name

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:42.010 align:middle line:84%
so that it doesn't clash with
any of the kids' aspects.

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:43.699 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it
supports the children

00:31:43.699 --> 00:31:44.740 align:middle line:90%
in where they want to go.

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.198 align:middle line:84%
I was actually
doing one yesterday.

00:31:46.198 --> 00:31:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And because there were a
husband and three kids,

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.160 align:middle line:90%
it got very complex.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.400 align:middle line:84%
But actually, we did
get clear in what

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.440 align:middle line:84%
was needed in the family
dynamic to rebalance it

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.590 align:middle line:84%
because if one person
shifts in the family

00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:00.940 align:middle line:84%
or in a relationship,
the other one will shift.

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's about giving everyone
what they need energetically.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So the whole flow of energy
between all the people

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:09.850 align:middle line:84%
in a partnership or
in a family dynamic

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:13.742 align:middle line:84%
actually creates a great
harmo-conscious whole

00:32:13.742 --> 00:32:14.575 align:middle line:90%
if you get it right.

00:32:14.575 --> 00:32:17.080 align:middle line:84%
If you don't get it right,
then it gets really messy.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.050 align:middle line:84%
It when things
start to fall apart.

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:22.870 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's very good
for families as well.

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:26.250 align:middle line:84%
But most importantly, in
relationships because you

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:28.650 align:middle line:84%
become more supportive
of each other.

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And if it's meant
to continue, it

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:35.500 align:middle line:84%
can be a new phase,
taking someone

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.280 align:middle line:84%
to a completely different
place in their relationship.

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And then the partner
has to change.

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.550 align:middle line:84%
It to be a bit strange
for them at first,

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:44.883 align:middle line:84%
but then they realize, hey,
this is actually quite good.

00:32:44.883 --> 00:32:47.550 align:middle line:84%
I've got some challenges, but
I'm actually working on it.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:50.700 align:middle line:84%
This is actually how they can
consciously change as well.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And sometimes, it
can be a very simple change.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:57.480 align:middle line:84%
When we were working
together, I only

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.280 align:middle line:90%
use two names-- Regina Meredith.

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out
there was actually

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:05.990 align:middle line:84%
internal conflict, not as much
external but internal conflict,

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:07.530 align:middle line:90%
built within that name.

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And so to resurrect
my middle name

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.771 align:middle line:84%
and just eliminate one letter
smoothed everything out

00:33:12.771 --> 00:33:13.270 align:middle line:90%
perfectly.

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And it came to me almost
instantly and intuitively.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you ran it through
and said yes, this is it.

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:21.270 align:middle line:84%
This removes all
of the obstacles.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:24.080 align:middle line:84%
So it can be something we
are using our intuition.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.430 align:middle line:84%
But it can also be something
really very simple,

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:29.457 align:middle line:84%
like just adding your middle
initial back in for example.

00:33:29.457 --> 00:33:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, the pieces
are actually there.

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:34.085 align:middle line:84%
You've just got to be still
and open to the answer

00:33:34.085 --> 00:33:35.460 align:middle line:84%
because the universe
will answer.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:39.320 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
complicated at all.

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.462 align:middle line:84%
How's it been feeling
since you started?

00:33:41.462 --> 00:33:42.920 align:middle line:84%
You've just said
to me earlier, you

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.610 align:middle line:84%
started playing
with using it more.

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:46.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I love
the sound of it.

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.040 align:middle line:84%
I like the feeling
and sound of it.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.740 align:middle line:90%
It feels very different.

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:53.770 align:middle line:84%
It has much more of
a circular feeling

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:58.619 align:middle line:84%
to me because I tend to see
things in form that I hear,

00:33:58.619 --> 00:33:59.160 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.850 align:middle line:90%
And so no, I really like it.

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:03.820 align:middle line:84%
So I'm starting to integrate
it by way of just my signature

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:05.240 align:middle line:90%
and when I meet new people.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.937 align:middle line:84%
Saying the name now and then
and trying it on for size.

00:34:07.937 --> 00:34:09.770 align:middle line:84%
So I'll be curious to
see after about a year

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:13.420 align:middle line:84%
or so of integrating more,
how it starts playing out

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:14.817 align:middle line:90%
within the dynamics with others.

00:34:14.817 --> 00:34:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Yeah, because
what's happening

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.730 align:middle line:84%
is that when use
a new name, it's

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:22.449 align:middle line:84%
a different vibration being
created in your fields.

00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:25.790 align:middle line:84%
So your DNA is programmed
with your first name.

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:27.514 align:middle line:84%
And the name is also
programmed into what

00:34:27.514 --> 00:34:28.889 align:middle line:84%
we call the karmic
metrics, which

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:30.489 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned in the
first interview.

00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:33.199 align:middle line:84%
So when you have a new vibration
happening, what it's doing

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:35.500 align:middle line:84%
is it's infusing and
activating in all parts of you.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
transforming your DNA

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:39.870 align:middle line:84%
to back to what we
started at the beginning.

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:41.495 align:middle line:84%
You're actually
literally doing surgery

00:34:41.495 --> 00:34:43.400 align:middle line:90%
on your DNA with frequency.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.650 align:middle line:84%
It takes about seven years
for it to fully change,

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:48.630 align:middle line:84%
but there are processes
for accelerating that.

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:52.056 align:middle line:84%
And so what actually
happens is your DNA changes.

00:34:52.056 --> 00:34:53.639 align:middle line:84%
See, the soul contract
energy actually

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:54.881 align:middle line:90%
sits in your energy fields.

00:34:54.881 --> 00:34:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And so that starts to change
as well because you're actually

00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:59.870 align:middle line:84%
infusing with your own
name different frequencies.

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:03.476 align:middle line:84%
And you're burning through the
karmic metrics much faster.

00:35:03.476 --> 00:35:06.100 align:middle line:84%
So you're literally transforming
your whole system with a name.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And if everyone starts to
call you that more and more,

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:09.960 align:middle line:90%
that's transmitting to you.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:10.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:12.266 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So the more you use
it, the more it changes.

00:35:12.266 --> 00:35:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And you realize when people
call me Nicholas Guy Ngan,

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:16.930 align:middle line:84%
I look back
thinking, who's that?

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who's that?

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:17.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:18.300 align:middle line:90%
No, that's very true.

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Can't relate to it.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.965 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I know
a number of people

00:35:20.965 --> 00:35:23.250 align:middle line:84%
who have changed their
name in their lifetime,

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:26.130 align:middle line:84%
whether it's omitting one or
completely changing their name.

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And they're different people,
wholly different people

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:30.975 align:middle line:90%
after a period of time.

00:35:30.975 --> 00:35:34.630 align:middle line:84%
It has such a deep impact
to change those frequencies.

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:40.160 align:middle line:84%
So now we have the situation
where a man and a woman

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.300 align:middle line:84%
meet, and say they're
going to marry.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.420 align:middle line:84%
I assume you would
recommend that a woman run

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:51.160 align:middle line:84%
the idea through the lens
of, say, the soul contract

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:54.170 align:middle line:84%
work before deciding whether
to change the name or not.

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
maybe a situation like

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:58.970 align:middle line:84%
that where someone said,
well, I have to do it by rote.

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:00.840 align:middle line:84%
I must change my name
to my husband's name.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And just disastrous things
happen then to the marriage?

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.120 align:middle line:90%
Does that happen?

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yes.

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:08.384 align:middle line:84%
It's a form of giving
away power for a woman

00:36:08.384 --> 00:36:09.800 align:middle line:84%
by having to take
on a man's name.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
in and of itself.

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:14.100 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
someone who may

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.650 align:middle line:84%
have taken on a
frequency that just

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:17.705 align:middle line:90%
didn't work for them at all.

00:36:17.705 --> 00:36:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Sometimes, it's actually
really good for someone.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, some people
would marry someone just

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:22.260 align:middle line:90%
for the name.

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:24.172 align:middle line:84%
Had one last week that
said, I married him,

00:36:24.172 --> 00:36:27.140 align:middle line:84%
and then I realized a week
later I don't want to do this.

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.042 align:middle line:90%
It all feels wrong.

00:36:28.042 --> 00:36:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I'm
keeping the name?

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: I divorced him
but I kept the name.

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:32.110 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:34.026 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, she said
it feels really good.

00:36:34.026 --> 00:36:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And you look at the
chart, and it is.

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.230 align:middle line:90%
That's what she wanted.

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:40.560 align:middle line:84%
So it means that a
woman's going to get

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:44.057 align:middle line:84%
a whole-- say you get
married three times.

00:36:44.057 --> 00:36:45.140 align:middle line:90%
So it's going to be three.

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And the name is changed
to the husband's.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.923 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be three
distinct new frequencies

00:36:48.923 --> 00:36:51.580 align:middle line:84%
or layers of icing
on the cake that's

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:54.620 align:middle line:84%
going to help her
grow more rapidly.

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And then it can
be a karmic cord,

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:00.120 align:middle line:84%
and really strong, and really
in your face and tough.

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.210 align:middle line:90%
Or it can be very harmonious.

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:04.110 align:middle line:84%
But usually, what
happens in relationships

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:06.495 align:middle line:84%
is they're quite
strong initially.

00:37:06.495 --> 00:37:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And then what
starts to happen is

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:10.779 align:middle line:84%
there's a switch to
bring the mission online.

00:37:10.779 --> 00:37:11.820 align:middle line:90%
And it's more supportive.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.885 align:middle line:84%
And by the time she might reach
her third or fourth husband,

00:37:13.885 --> 00:37:16.410 align:middle line:84%
it's actually really harmonious,
really opens and flows.

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think it's
really good, which

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:20.630 align:middle line:84%
it couldn't have
without the right name.

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:24.764 align:middle line:84%
So people who know about this
always come to me, should

00:37:24.764 --> 00:37:25.930 align:middle line:90%
I change it or not, Nicolas?

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:26.970 align:middle line:90%
Should it be both names?

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Now what some people do
is they use both surnames,

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:32.267 align:middle line:84%
and they look very
carefully to see

00:37:32.267 --> 00:37:33.600 align:middle line:90%
how the dynamic's going to work.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, that
makes perfect sense.

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:36.810 align:middle line:84%
The man doesn't
usually have-- at least

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:38.540 align:middle line:84%
in the Western
cultures-- doesn't

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.730 align:middle line:84%
have that possibility
of changing his name

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:42.279 align:middle line:84%
to capture that
advantage though.

00:37:42.279 --> 00:37:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: I've had some
people start to do it

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:45.190 align:middle line:90%
when they understand this.

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:46.951 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: They say,
let's look at both.

00:37:46.951 --> 00:37:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And they both take
on the same surname.

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:51.046 align:middle line:84%
They use both names
in the surname.

00:37:51.046 --> 00:37:52.920 align:middle line:84%
That sort of stuff
happening now because they

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.360 align:middle line:90%
want the frequency.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:57.482 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's talk about--

00:37:57.482 --> 00:37:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You and lady friend
here who doesn't have a name.

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: And my lady friend here.

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:04.460 align:middle line:84%
So she agreed to
have this on provided

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:06.140 align:middle line:90%
we didn't have the name.

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:11.660 align:middle line:84%
So in this chart here, in
her chart, in column 3,

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:14.090 align:middle line:84%
she's got all these
7s in physical karma

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:15.310 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual karma.

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And a 7 has their
heart broken usually

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.365 align:middle line:90%
by the parent or both parents.

00:38:19.365 --> 00:38:22.120 align:middle line:90%


00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And the result of that is that
they don't feel safe in life.

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:27.710 align:middle line:84%
The inner child feels
I want to hide away.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:29.040 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be seen.

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Because if I show myself, I'm
going to get hurt and rejected

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.950 align:middle line:84%
again, and I just
can't bear the pain.

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:36.300 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
that they hide away

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:38.570 align:middle line:84%
and they try and control
situations unconsciously.

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:39.945 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
inner child does.

00:38:39.945 --> 00:38:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And they put out
a facade with a 7.

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:42.230 align:middle line:90%
Here's me.

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And you can't ever actually
find out who they truly are.

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So what happened here in
the dynamic between us

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:52.020 align:middle line:84%
is that my 3s here in
the physical karma,

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:55.020 align:middle line:90%
in column 1, my birth name.

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.170 align:middle line:90%
3s are about great depth.

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And when they transmit
across to the 7s in the 16-7

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.520 align:middle line:84%
in her birth chart,
column 3, that

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:06.550 align:middle line:84%
would bring the hidden side
of her out into the world.

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:08.656 align:middle line:84%
And we've been friends
for two and a half years.

00:39:08.656 --> 00:39:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening
is actually,

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:12.850 align:middle line:90%
that is starting to happen.

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:15.820 align:middle line:84%
She said to me the other week,
I'm going to stop hiding.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:17.270 align:middle line:90%
It's time to show myself.

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:20.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's taken that long
of a transmission for it

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:22.850 align:middle line:90%
to start to come through.

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:26.520 align:middle line:84%
But as a result of showing
her true self, lots of people

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:31.785 align:middle line:84%
open to her at work, lots
of new friends turned up,

00:39:31.785 --> 00:39:33.444 align:middle line:90%
new connections turned up.

00:39:33.444 --> 00:39:34.860 align:middle line:84%
A new job just
turned up recently.

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.245 align:middle line:90%
She just started this week.

00:39:36.245 --> 00:39:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was complete
opposite of her first job

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.730 align:middle line:84%
where she was suppressed,
just like she was as a kid,

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:43.920 align:middle line:84%
because she's got 9s
in physical goals.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.357 align:middle line:84%
Lowered disempowerment
by her boss

00:39:45.357 --> 00:39:46.690 align:middle line:90%
and the whole corporate culture.

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me yesterday,
I'm so happy at my new job.

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Because she drew
like-minded people to her,

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:55.080 align:middle line:84%
which is what the 7 does
when your heart is open,

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.497 align:middle line:84%
and when you can show the real
you and your true feelings.

00:39:57.497 --> 00:39:59.496 align:middle line:84%
So now she's got a
completely different reality,

00:39:59.496 --> 00:40:00.146 align:middle line:90%
which changed.

00:40:00.146 --> 00:40:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this happened as
a result of being connected then

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:06.290 align:middle line:84%
with you, in partnership, and
your numbers, your frequencies

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:07.510 align:middle line:90%
bringing out those in her.

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: That would've
accelerated it, yes.

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:11.152 align:middle line:90%


00:40:11.152 --> 00:40:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And also because
she got conscious.

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:14.130 align:middle line:90%
She had the chart from me.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:15.339 align:middle line:90%
This is how it works.

00:40:15.339 --> 00:40:17.380 align:middle line:84%
So now she has a really
amazingly group of people

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.700 align:middle line:84%
to work with, who's she's
got a lot in common with.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:20.520 align:middle line:90%
And she's so happy.

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.217 align:middle line:84%
And her life had gone
from black to white

00:40:23.217 --> 00:40:25.550 align:middle line:84%
over a period of a couple
weeks because she transitioned

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:28.390 align:middle line:84%
from one job to another
because she was ready.

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And then she feels safe
to show her true self.

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:32.480 align:middle line:90%
So now what happens?

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Because this is more like
a personal growth process

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:38.185 align:middle line:90%
for both of us.

00:40:38.185 --> 00:40:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Lots of other men
are turning up,

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.110 align:middle line:84%
interested in her,
who are actually

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:43.590 align:middle line:90%
more compatible for her.

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:44.964 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Than you?

00:40:44.964 --> 00:40:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, it's just a
different choice, you see.

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:47.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a different choice.

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:49.443 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now,
this is brave of you

00:40:49.443 --> 00:40:51.480 align:middle line:84%
because you're obliged
to do the right thing

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.000 align:middle line:84%
and continue helping,
assisting, working with her

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.580 align:middle line:84%
along this line regardless of
what the charts are showing.

00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:03.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, we know that our
relationship is a deep soul

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:05.730 align:middle line:84%
connection which was
designed to help us come back

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:07.130 align:middle line:90%
into wholeness.

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:08.800 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have a
problem with that.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.339 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way it's designed.

00:41:10.339 --> 00:41:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Because we know this is what
is was always meant to be.

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh good, you get that.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.959 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have to
fight with that.

00:41:15.959 --> 00:41:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:19.010 align:middle line:84%
A very deeply,
personally, emotionally

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:21.390 align:middle line:90%
intimate relationship.

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:23.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's practice
for the next phase.

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And so what's now
happened is that men

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:29.620 align:middle line:84%
who are able to meet
her in her power, which

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.640 align:middle line:84%
is a 9, inner truth,
are now turning up.

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Whereas previously, as
most women who watch things

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.390 align:middle line:84%
will probably find, most
men are emotional boys.

00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And you've got two kids and
the third one's your husband.

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.470 align:middle line:84%
A lot of woman
clients have that.

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And so this friend of mine
used to have a lot of that.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.849 align:middle line:84%
A lot of boys would turn up
in men's bodies, emotionally.

00:41:48.849 --> 00:41:50.390 align:middle line:84%
But now what happens
is because she's

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:54.250 align:middle line:84%
come more into the truth
of who she is as a woman

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:55.750 align:middle line:84%
and into more of
her goddess energy,

00:41:55.750 --> 00:42:00.230 align:middle line:84%
which is a 13-4 in soul destiny,
because she's in the energy,

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:02.190 align:middle line:84%
she now only
attracts men who have

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:04.400 align:middle line:84%
done a lot of work on
themselves who are conscious,

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.250 align:middle line:90%
who are ready to relate to this.

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And all the emotional boys
have gone and disappeared,

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.770 align:middle line:84%
which she's obviously
very happy about.

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:11.436 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, I think
a lot of the women

00:42:11.436 --> 00:42:13.195 align:middle line:84%
watching this can
probably relate to that.

00:42:13.195 --> 00:42:15.070 align:middle line:84%
But there has to be an
internal shift in them

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:16.110 align:middle line:90%
before they draw it.

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So this deeply
connected, emotionally intimate

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:23.860 align:middle line:84%
relationship has been a
training ground for both of us

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:28.290 align:middle line:84%
to actually become whole
again as emotional beings

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:30.430 align:middle line:84%
in the world, having been
through a lot of wounding

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:32.391 align:middle line:84%
with the 9 here, which
is very disempowering.

00:42:32.391 --> 00:42:34.015 align:middle line:84%
It means a very
disempowering childhood

00:42:34.015 --> 00:42:35.870 align:middle line:90%
where you shut down emotionally.

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what the
soul organizers say,

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:44.540 align:middle line:84%
especially, we've made a
transitionary relationship,

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:47.520 align:middle line:84%
friendship, so we can
get on with our lives

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.850 align:middle line:84%
and get to places we
thought we'd never get to.

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:52.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and
that's completely valid.

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:54.490 align:middle line:90%
Again, this is not a failure.

00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:56.170 align:middle line:90%
Everyone goes for the goal.

00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:58.062 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to make
this a relationship?

00:42:58.062 --> 00:42:59.020 align:middle line:90%
Are we going to commit?

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:00.311 align:middle line:90%
Are we going to make this work?

00:43:00.311 --> 00:43:03.790 align:middle line:84%
When in reality, there's every
flavor of type of connection

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:05.420 align:middle line:90%
out there for our growth.

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's the part
that people just

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:11.050 align:middle line:84%
have such a hard time
unlocking from the concept

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:14.250 align:middle line:84%
that there is an end
goal to a relationship.

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, the thing
is that people think,

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.300 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get them, and
marry them, and pin them down.

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.950 align:middle line:84%
Then I'm done, and
then I can relax.

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:23.194 align:middle line:90%
And actually, that kills it.

00:43:23.194 --> 00:43:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does, you know.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And it might be
that your whole life

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:28.800 align:middle line:84%
is preparatory relationship,
another preparatory

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:29.760 align:middle line:90%
relationship.

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a marriage
that goes for awhile,

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and you learn or
don't, and another one.

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's a totally
normal profile of someone

00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:40.160 align:middle line:84%
who's on their path and
learning as a soul embodied.

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So this is
all about having

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:44.400 align:middle line:90%
no attachment to the outcome.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.830 align:middle line:84%
About being present
in the moment,

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and conscious relating, and
being totally authentic.

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can't be totally
authentic in a relationship,

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.920 align:middle line:84%
which is what I was
learning here, then, well,

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.120 align:middle line:90%
what's the point?

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:57.940 align:middle line:90%
What is the point?

00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:58.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What is the point?

00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: If you sacrifice
yourself to get someone

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:02.060 align:middle line:84%
to love you, how long's
that going to last?

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Because you're going to get
sick and tired of doing that

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:03.995 align:middle line:90%
after a while.

00:44:03.995 --> 00:44:05.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's suffering.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: That's suffering.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And attachment, as the Buddhas
say, is the path of suffering.

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's about having
no attachment,

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:15.710 align:middle line:84%
which is a 13-4 in her chart,
and my 13-4 in my overlay

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:18.020 align:middle line:84%
in that physical
talent position.

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Having no attachment
and being in the moment,

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:24.680 align:middle line:84%
and just being present
with the gifts that come.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.715 align:middle line:84%
And that, actually,
is conscious relating.

00:44:26.715 --> 00:44:29.425 align:middle line:84%
And if it's meant to turn
into something deeper,

00:44:29.425 --> 00:44:30.925 align:middle line:84%
with more commitment,
the commitment

00:44:30.925 --> 00:44:32.360 align:middle line:90%
should just come naturally.

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.370 align:middle line:84%
It's like this is the
next natural step.

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:35.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
I have to have

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:37.270 align:middle line:84%
because the ego
wants to control it.

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't
want to lose the love.

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:42.710 align:middle line:84%
That actual ego control is
what's going to kill it.

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:45.930 align:middle line:84%
But if you just trust,
and open, and allow,

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:47.629 align:middle line:90%
nature will take its course.

00:44:47.629 --> 00:44:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And what it means is
that if someone really

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.350 align:middle line:84%
means to be with you,
and they're authentic

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:53.876 align:middle line:84%
and you're authentic, it's
going to sort itself out anyway.

00:44:53.876 --> 00:44:55.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a natural
filtering process.

00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:57.791 align:middle line:84%
Because you're going to find
out who they really are and then

00:44:57.791 --> 00:44:59.220 align:middle line:84%
you decide, do I
like this or not?

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:01.136 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have dating,
that sort of stuff.

00:45:01.136 --> 00:45:02.409 align:middle line:90%
What do I like and don't like?

00:45:02.409 --> 00:45:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And what actually
happens is that you

00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:05.790 align:middle line:84%
get through a process
of elimination.

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And when we're younger, we
tend to-- oh, that'll do.

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:11.450 align:middle line:84%
But as we get older,
as you and I know,

00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:12.920 align:middle line:90%
well, actually, that won't do.

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.660 align:middle line:90%
In fact, that is unacceptable.

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:17.630 align:middle line:90%
And so we get more discerning.

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And consciously relating, once
people know about the system,

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:21.990 align:middle line:84%
for example, everyone says,
look, I've found a new man.

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:23.420 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to date
him, but I'm not

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:24.590 align:middle line:84%
sure I should take
it to the next stage.

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:25.964 align:middle line:84%
Can you please
check the numbers?

00:45:25.964 --> 00:45:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Because, oh, I'm 50-50.

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:30.290 align:middle line:84%
But once they've got the
understanding of where they're

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:32.570 align:middle line:84%
coming from, they know
what they're working with.

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:35.940 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like we need
to maybe also start

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:39.670 align:middle line:84%
looking at doing away with that
little dance of the peacocks,

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:42.860 align:middle line:84%
which is part of the normal
mating thing in all species.

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:44.830 align:middle line:84%
But there's a point at
which where you're only

00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:47.294 align:middle line:84%
putting your best foot
forward, and that's all

00:45:47.294 --> 00:45:48.710 align:middle line:84%
you allow the other
person to see.

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:51.622 align:middle line:84%
It's really retarding the
process of authenticity.

00:45:51.622 --> 00:45:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, eventually, you
might end up living together.

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:55.790 align:middle line:84%
So you're going
to soon find out--

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You might as well find
out right off the bat, right?

00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: --who someone really is.

00:45:59.110 --> 00:45:59.610 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:01.870 align:middle line:84%
So with this system,
what people often do is

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:03.810 align:middle line:90%
they get it from the beginning.

00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:04.409 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:04.409 --> 00:46:05.450 align:middle line:90%
I've met this new person.

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:06.533 align:middle line:90%
Check all the numbers out.

00:46:06.533 --> 00:46:08.800 align:middle line:90%
What am I getting myself into?

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.720 align:middle line:84%
So then they go
off and consciously

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:11.887 align:middle line:90%
learn about what's going on.

00:46:11.887 --> 00:46:14.011 align:middle line:84%
And what some people do is
they share the recording

00:46:14.011 --> 00:46:14.910 align:middle line:90%
with the person.

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:16.490 align:middle line:90%
And usually, it goes very well.

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And I've dated women,
and we've done this.

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:20.820 align:middle line:84%
So we save a lot of time
by actually saying--

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Great idea.

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Here's who I am.

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:24.360 align:middle line:90%
Here's who you are.

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.300 align:middle line:90%
Here's how it works.

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:25.960 align:middle line:90%
And here's where I am.

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.585 align:middle line:84%
And everyone goes,
OK, everyone's cards

00:46:27.585 --> 00:46:28.310 align:middle line:90%
are on the table.

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:32.440 align:middle line:84%
But actually, then we can decide
to go deeper and deeper, more

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.930 align:middle line:84%
authentically from the beginning
because nothing is hidden.

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And so when things do come up--
let's say, for example, 7 here.

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Not feeling safe.

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:43.730 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, I'm going
to make a woman feel safe.

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:44.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Or if she's having a real
hard day with disempowerment,

00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:49.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to go and jump on.

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:51.202 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be very
gentle and hold the space

00:46:51.202 --> 00:46:52.660 align:middle line:84%
so she can work
through that issue.

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:54.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What a conscious
way to go about things.

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:57.225 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: So actually then, when
a partner knows that's going on,

00:46:57.225 --> 00:46:58.540 align:middle line:90%
they feel, OK, I can be myself.

00:46:58.540 --> 00:46:59.740 align:middle line:90%
I can be very vulnerable.

00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:01.930 align:middle line:84%
I can be in the
really hurt places,

00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:04.745 align:middle line:84%
and my partner understands
me, that's massively

00:47:04.745 --> 00:47:06.370 align:middle line:84%
healing because
they're just witnessed.

00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:07.495 align:middle line:90%
Women like to be witnessed.

00:47:07.495 --> 00:47:09.820 align:middle line:84%
But if a man consciously
witnesses a woman

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:12.830 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't tread over all
the sensitive parts of her,

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:15.040 align:middle line:84%
she's going to really
like him for that

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.140 align:middle line:90%
because she feels supported.

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And the man's actually
consciously knowing

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:21.120 align:middle line:90%
what he's doing.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And then also, a man
knows a woman knows

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.150 align:middle line:84%
where his weaknesses are and
she can work with that-- which

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:28.600 align:middle line:84%
is what happens here in our
friendship-- then actually,

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:32.770 align:middle line:84%
it builds a space of great trust
and great soul love, really.

00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:34.280 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very powerful.

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And so actually, it's a
very rich relationship

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:40.650 align:middle line:90%
when you have that.

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it can
continue to grow because

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:48.210 align:middle line:84%
of that bedrock of foundation
of trust and knowingness

00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:49.995 align:middle line:90%
of who each other is.

00:47:49.995 --> 00:47:54.350 align:middle line:84%
So actually, it has a
massive effect on growth.

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And so what this
one does here is

00:47:57.010 --> 00:48:01.080 align:middle line:84%
that this is 14-5 in spiritual
talents and spiritual goals,

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:03.330 align:middle line:84%
and that's called
reflected being.

00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And what that's
about is where I'm

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.720 align:middle line:84%
showing the mirror of
who I am all the time.

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:10.930 align:middle line:90%
She's hypersensitive.

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:12.229 align:middle line:90%
She can pick up everything.

00:48:12.229 --> 00:48:13.270 align:middle line:90%
So I can't hide anything.

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:14.392 align:middle line:90%
So I don't.

00:48:14.392 --> 00:48:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's like I get to see all
the hidden parts in me which

00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:18.545 align:middle line:90%
my ego would rather deny.

00:48:18.545 --> 00:48:21.040 align:middle line:84%
But I get to see them, and
they're mirrored to me,

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:22.900 align:middle line:90%
and I work with them.

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.910 align:middle line:84%
So I can check and say,
where am I going with that?

00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And you know what
she said to me?

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:29.040 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I was wondering when
that was going to happen.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:29.706 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:29.706 --> 00:48:30.680 align:middle line:90%
She was waiting for it.

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.221 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Waiting for
that conversation

00:48:32.221 --> 00:48:35.600 align:middle line:84%
or waiting for that question
of what we do with this issue.

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very
powerful having that.

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it made me
realize that actually, it's

00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:46.600 align:middle line:84%
not possible to function in
an unconscious relationship

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.620 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:49.800 align:middle line:90%
I'd rather not have one.

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:51.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yes.

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:57.220 align:middle line:84%
It sounds so illusory, so
tedious to stumble along just

00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:00.950 align:middle line:84%
based on some feelings at
large when you can actually

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:04.580 align:middle line:84%
have access to doing it in
such a deep and conscious way.

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And speaking of
stumbling-- well,

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:07.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
stumbling along.

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:09.690 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask
you a little bit ago,

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:15.150 align:middle line:84%
I know a couple of men who are
friends of mine who have both

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:18.200 align:middle line:84%
repeatedly, throughout their
lives, said the same thing.

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.370 align:middle line:90%
They get involved with someone.

00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:21.900 align:middle line:90%
It falls apart.

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And then they
marry the next guy.

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:27.140 align:middle line:90%
The woman marries the next guy.

00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:30.180 align:middle line:84%
So they're always the
one before "the one."

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:32.020 align:middle line:84%
So what kind of
dynamic might they

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:34.490 align:middle line:84%
possess that women
attracted to them

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:37.230 align:middle line:84%
seem to stay with them a
while and prepare themselves

00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:40.940 align:middle line:84%
to be with whoever it is they're
actually going to be with?

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: It can be because
the men may be still

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:48.790 align:middle line:84%
not emotionally initiated
into his masculine energy.

00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:50.310 align:middle line:84%
Because for a
relationship to work,

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:54.055 align:middle line:84%
there needs to be a very clear
balanced male-female dynamic.

00:49:54.055 --> 00:49:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That makes sense.

00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:56.555 align:middle line:84%
From the two men
I'm thinking of,

00:49:56.555 --> 00:49:57.920 align:middle line:90%
they're stuck in the boy thing.

00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Yeah.

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:00.595 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is
as a woman gets older,

00:50:00.595 --> 00:50:02.970 align:middle line:84%
we say, oh, she gets a bit
bored with the emotional boys.

00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:06.980 align:middle line:84%
This is like, I don't feel safe
to let go into my feminine,

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:09.470 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, I'm not
going to let him in.

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:10.320 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.467 align:middle line:84%
And then the man feels
inadequate because often,

00:50:13.467 --> 00:50:15.300 align:middle line:84%
in a way, especially
more professional women

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:16.091 align:middle line:90%
are more masculine.

00:50:16.091 --> 00:50:19.680 align:middle line:84%
They've had to become that to
actually survive in the world

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:24.150 align:middle line:84%
because it's a very
patriarchal culture still.

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And so the woman
is more masculine

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:29.300 align:middle line:84%
and he is less masculine, so
guess what's going to happen?

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.110 align:middle line:84%
You don't have a good
polarity running.

00:50:31.110 --> 00:50:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:32.369 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: OK.

00:50:32.369 --> 00:50:34.750 align:middle line:84%
So we can see this
in the soul contract.

00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a
very good point, yes.

00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: If you
have a 10-1, which

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:41.720 align:middle line:84%
is about disempowerment
by the father, usually.

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Or the mother disempowering
the masculine.

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:46.257 align:middle line:84%
If a man has that, or 9s,
a lot of disempowerment,

00:50:46.257 --> 00:50:48.590 align:middle line:84%
it's hard for him to climb
out of being an emotional boy

00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:50.725 align:middle line:84%
unless he does a
little work on himself.

00:50:50.725 --> 00:50:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, women
aren't going to commit to him.

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:57.620 align:middle line:84%
He's not going to draw a
mature goddess-type woman

00:50:57.620 --> 00:50:59.380 align:middle line:84%
because she's not
going to be interested.

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:02.780 align:middle line:84%
But if he actually works through
that issue, then what happens

00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:04.704 align:middle line:84%
is he becomes very
attractive to those women

00:51:04.704 --> 00:51:06.870 align:middle line:84%
because they're actually
not interested in the boys.

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:09.700 align:middle line:84%
The pool of conscious
men is actually

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:11.492 align:middle line:84%
smaller than the pool
of conscious women.

00:51:11.492 --> 00:51:12.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:13.870 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was
going to ask you next.

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:16.585 align:middle line:90%
That's so not fair as a woman.

00:51:16.585 --> 00:51:20.300 align:middle line:90%
That's so not fair.

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: Well, that's
why we do this work,

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:24.470 align:middle line:90%
to create more conscious men.

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:26.667 align:middle line:90%
They are out there.

00:51:26.667 --> 00:51:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why is it,
would you say-- I mean,

00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:30.936 align:middle line:90%
we have various ideas on it.

00:51:30.936 --> 00:51:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Do you see with your
clients in any way

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:36.050 align:middle line:84%
that women seem to be able to
go through the normal maturation

00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:38.730 align:middle line:84%
process and work into
becoming a woman,

00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:41.530 align:middle line:84%
and the men have so much
more difficulty moving

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:43.290 align:middle line:90%
into that role for themselves?

00:51:43.290 --> 00:51:46.510 align:middle line:84%
It couldn't have always been
that way throughout history.

00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:48.810 align:middle line:84%
My thinking is it
might be something

00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:52.510 align:middle line:84%
maybe within the last post
World War II or something.

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:55.337 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: I would say more after
the Industrial Revolution.

00:51:55.337 --> 00:51:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Would you?

00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:56.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:57.211 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:51:57.211 --> 00:51:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: 1700, 1800s.

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Because most people
used to work on farms

00:52:02.610 --> 00:52:04.590 align:middle line:90%
or in small communities.

00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:07.110 align:middle line:90%
It was more agricultural.

00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And so a boy would become
an apprentice usually

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.220 align:middle line:90%
to his father.

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:13.650 align:middle line:84%
He would make cart wheels
or he'd be the blacksmith.

00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:19.290 align:middle line:84%
So he would see
his father at work.

00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:23.250 align:middle line:84%
See, men are very
isolated creatures.

00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:25.235 align:middle line:84%
They don't for a
sisterhood like women.

00:52:25.235 --> 00:52:27.360 align:middle line:84%
So they actually don't get
the support of other men

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:28.985 align:middle line:84%
because men are
inherently competitive.

00:52:28.985 --> 00:52:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So they have to work it all
out from scratch every time,

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.490 align:middle line:90%
every generation.

00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is that a
man who sees his father, who

00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:40.910 align:middle line:84%
is a blacksmith, beating
the metal into shape,

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:43.940 align:middle line:84%
using his power in the world,
gets a transmission-- ah,

00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:45.800 align:middle line:90%
this is what it is to be a man.

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.460 align:middle line:84%
But once we started
moving into cities,

00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:49.910 align:middle line:84%
and fathers were going
off to work in an office,

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:51.480 align:middle line:90%
the boy had no idea.

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:52.447 align:middle line:90%
Well, what does dad do?

00:52:52.447 --> 00:52:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I see.

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: He goes away
at 8:00 in the morning.

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.370 align:middle line:90%
Comes back at 7:00 at night.

00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:56.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what he does.

00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:57.922 align:middle line:90%
He goes to an office.

00:52:57.922 --> 00:52:59.505 align:middle line:84%
And so he doesn't
get the transmission

00:52:59.505 --> 00:53:02.210 align:middle line:84%
of what it is to
use masculine power.

00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:09.500 align:middle line:84%
So in tribal societies, boys
at puberty were taken away,

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and then they were
to be initiated

00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:13.450 align:middle line:90%
by the warriors of the tribe.

00:53:13.450 --> 00:53:15.992 align:middle line:84%
Because they were the
next generation, and they

00:53:15.992 --> 00:53:17.450 align:middle line:84%
were required to
protect the tribe.

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:19.950 align:middle line:84%
They had to fight,
and hunt, and preserve

00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:23.400 align:middle line:84%
the environment, which
indigenous people still

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.310 align:middle line:90%
do their best nowadays.

00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And so the boys had to look at
their deepest, darkest fears,

00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:30.520 align:middle line:90%
their shadows, the karmic stuff.

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And they had to learn
how to face their shadows

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:35.440 align:middle line:90%
and transmute them.

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Like a samurai
warrior for example,

00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:40.130 align:middle line:84%
he goes into battle with his
fear on the tip of his sword.

00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:41.990 align:middle line:84%
He actually is
conscious of his fear

00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:43.240 align:middle line:90%
because he's trained that way.

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the shadow of the
fear does not trip him up.

00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:48.470 align:middle line:10%
But Western men mostly
do not have that.

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:52.479 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, their shadows
are sabotaging them.

00:53:52.479 --> 00:53:54.270 align:middle line:10%
They stay emotionally
as a boy because they

00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:56.816 align:middle line:10%
didn't get initiated
through their fears.

00:53:56.816 --> 00:53:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they end up doing
what they do out in the world.

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:02.350 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
world, what happens?

00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:03.720 align:middle line:90%
The way it's run.

00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:07.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of emotional boys
running it for personal gain.

00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:08.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: And so there,
they need to be initiated.

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:13.240 align:middle line:90%
And we're losing that.

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:14.900 align:middle line:90%
We don't have that in the West.

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:15.810 --> 00:54:17.000 align:middle line:90%
That makes perfect sense.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.375 align:middle line:84%
>>NGAN: That's
the reason we have

00:54:18.375 --> 00:54:21.156 align:middle line:90%
more boys and more women around.

00:54:21.156 --> 00:54:22.280 align:middle line:90%
That's actually the reason.

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:23.196 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:54:23.196 --> 00:54:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're out of
time on this talk.

00:54:25.090 --> 00:54:26.760 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
continue into part 2

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:28.870 align:middle line:84%
because we haven't
gotten into what

00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:31.470 align:middle line:84%
it's like to raise a
family consciously.

00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And our children-- you even
have my chart with my son and I,

00:54:35.350 --> 00:54:39.720 align:middle line:84%
which I haven't had a
reading on that from you.

00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:42.030 align:middle line:84%
So I'll be curious
to find out myself

00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:45.837 align:middle line:84%
what would've been the ideal
way to have interacted with him.

00:54:45.837 --> 00:54:46.420 align:middle line:90%
And who knows?

00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a lot of that
happened anyway.

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:48.341 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:54:48.341 --> 00:54:50.460 align:middle line:84%
But I'm looking
forward to that part.

00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:53.360 align:middle line:84%
So thank you, and
we will return.

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>>NGAN: Thank you, Regina.

00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:55.960 align:middle line:10%
