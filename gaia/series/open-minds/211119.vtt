>> CHARLES SHULTS: It's going
to pervade our lives at every

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.795 align:middle line:90%
level very soon.

00:00:12.795 --> 00:00:14.920 align:middle line:84%
So it's good to know where
we stand, what it means,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.920 align:middle line:90%
and what it's all about.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.650 align:middle line:84%
All of this is an
exploration to see

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.940 align:middle line:84%
how we can open up
the brain without,

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.850 align:middle line:84%
of course, destroying
the autonomy

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:22.990 align:middle line:90%
of the individual person.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.910 align:middle line:84%
The big question is,
if it's smart enough

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.250 align:middle line:84%
to understand what you're
instructing it to do,

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.100 align:middle line:84%
why would it want to do
what you tell it and not

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.460 align:middle line:90%
what it wants to do?

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.060 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be merged with
machinery the way things are

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.610 align:middle line:84%
going, and perhaps that
might be the solution

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.630 align:middle line:84%
to an impending machine disaster
that people imagine coming.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.060 align:middle line:90%
What makes you you?

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.777 align:middle line:84%
Life itself is natural
nanotechnology.

00:00:45.777 --> 00:00:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Explain
what you mean by that.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.560 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.630 align:middle line:10%
Today's guest, Sir
Charles Shults,

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.300 align:middle line:10%
has worked on weapons
systems, missile systems,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.240 align:middle line:10%
and advanced attack helicopter
systems for the aerospace

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.090 align:middle line:10%
industry.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.170 align:middle line:84%
All of this led him to work
into the area of robotics

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.420 align:middle line:84%
and AI for which he
attained knighthood.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.050 align:middle line:84%
He is here to have a very
direct conversation about AI

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.760 align:middle line:84%
and how the citizens
of Earth will

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.200 align:middle line:90%
be confronted with its use.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Good or bad, we're going
to take a nice look at it.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.555 align:middle line:90%
Charles, welcome to Open Minds.

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:17.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Thank you.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.870 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.995 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: This should be--

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:20.820 align:middle line:84%
you're so articulate
and well versed.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.820 align:middle line:84%
This should be a really
fascinating conversation

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.150 align:middle line:84%
because it's scary for
people to contemplate.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.520 align:middle line:84%
If you're under
20, it's exciting.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.990 align:middle line:84%
If you're over 20, you
have some questions.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.790 align:middle line:90%
There's very--

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Absolutely.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --much a
generational divide on this one.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.025 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: It is.

00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:34.825 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.970 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
everyone's saying sir?

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.613 align:middle line:84%
But he doesn't have
a British accent.

00:01:39.613 --> 00:01:41.030 align:middle line:84%
How did you end
up being knighted?

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.947 align:middle line:10%
>> Shults: Well, it's
interesting because many

00:01:42.947 --> 00:01:46.400 align:middle line:10%
knighthoods are conferred
by other kings and domains.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.140 align:middle line:10%
King of Sweden,
the King of Denmark

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.270 align:middle line:10%
have knights in their
service, but it actually

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.250 align:middle line:10%
came about because
I was knighted

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.870 align:middle line:10%
by a Scottish Baron who
purchased the Leslie baronage.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.020 align:middle line:10%
And under the terms
of the Magna Carta,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.420 align:middle line:10%
landed barons were
allowed to knight people,

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.020 align:middle line:10%
and that was in 1215, and
it's not been repealed.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.440 align:middle line:84%
So I was awarded a five-year
grant and a knighthood

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.690 align:middle line:84%
to pursue my research in
artificial intelligence

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.490 align:middle line:90%
and robotics.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
and you're here,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.413 align:middle line:84%
and you were able to do
that with that grant too.

00:02:16.413 --> 00:02:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Absolutely.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wonderful.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And I know you have a
splendid piece of property

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.950 align:middle line:84%
where you're coming up
with all kinds of stuff.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.840 align:middle line:84%
So we won't even get
into that just yet.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.670 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, we're
talking about brain implants.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.190 align:middle line:84%
This is something that has
been rather frightening

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.710 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of people,
especially people

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.910 align:middle line:84%
who frequent a lot of
conspiracy sites, in particular.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And I want to start
tearing down what

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.540 align:middle line:84%
we have reason to
be concerned about

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and what we have reason
to be excited about,

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.240 align:middle line:84%
because whether we like it
or not, AI is here to stay,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.890 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to become
an increasingly more

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:84%
prevalent part of our
lives on every level.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.755 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: It will.

00:02:58.755 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle line:90%
It absolutely will.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And as a lot of
people point out,

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.310 align:middle line:84%
it's one of those technologies
that, like a video game

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.590 align:middle line:84%
or like instant
communications, is

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.775 align:middle line:84%
going to pervade our lives
at every level very soon.

00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's good to know where
we stand, what it means,

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.295 align:middle line:90%
and what it's all about.

00:03:14.295 --> 00:03:15.545 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I absolutely agree.

00:03:15.545 --> 00:03:16.345 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:03:16.345 --> 00:03:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: So well,
to start with,

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.350 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the research lately
has been in an effort to open

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:90%
the human mind.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is,
the human mind has

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.830 align:middle line:84%
been locked away since the
beginning of humankind.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.573 align:middle line:84%
And there's not an easy
communication-- well,

00:03:31.573 --> 00:03:32.490 align:middle line:90%
communication channel.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.470 align:middle line:84%
In and out of it
we speak, we draw,

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.940 align:middle line:84%
we communicate
with other people,

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.650 align:middle line:90%
but that's a limited bandwidth.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.420 align:middle line:90%
You can only share so much.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.390 align:middle line:84%
When we get down to the
ability to literally tap

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.955 align:middle line:84%
into the computers that
reside in the brain

00:03:45.955 --> 00:03:47.580 align:middle line:84%
and get information
in and out of them,

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.800 align:middle line:84%
suddenly, we have
a huge expansion

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.090 align:middle line:90%
of what we're capable of.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Primarily right now, people are
looking at movement control,

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.570 align:middle line:84%
such as paralysis or
spinal cord injury, how

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.430 align:middle line:84%
they can read the
signals out of the brain

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and bypass the damaged areas
and restore movement and control

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.150 align:middle line:90%
the people.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.145 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big plus.

00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, and we're going
to go down that rabbit hole

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.410 align:middle line:84%
a little further because we
have a couple of different

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.620 align:middle line:90%
technologies out there.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.260 align:middle line:84%
One of them is Elon
Musk's Neuralink

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.760 align:middle line:84%
which frightens a
lot of people that

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.649 align:middle line:90%
are watching this right now.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:19.140 align:middle line:84%
But when you're talking
about opening the human mind,

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.970 align:middle line:84%
there's a transcendental
element to that.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not just raw data in there.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.560 align:middle line:90%
It's capability, right?

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Right.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.170 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And everybody shares
a lot of skills

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.620 align:middle line:84%
that are lost if they can't
communicate them properly.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.210 align:middle line:84%
There's an old
African proverb that

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.500 align:middle line:84%
says, "When an old man dies, a
library burns to the ground."

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, all of the experiences
you've had in your life

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.310 align:middle line:90%
are locked away in your head.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And only the handful who are
articulate writers or producers

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.880 align:middle line:84%
of scripts or works
of manuscripts

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.070 align:middle line:84%
that carry that
information in textbooks

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:90%
can get that out to people.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.610 align:middle line:84%
We're reaching a
stage now where you

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.040 align:middle line:84%
may be able to transfer
whole blocks of experience

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.970 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge in a few moments
by literally opening up

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.620 align:middle line:84%
channels of data
into your brain.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: One of the things it
says here in my notes is nature

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.565 align:middle line:90%
has limited I/O.

00:05:07.565 --> 00:05:08.967 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Oh, yes, I/O--

00:05:08.967 --> 00:05:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: In-- for minds.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.235 align:middle line:90%
What does that even mean?

00:05:11.235 --> 00:05:12.805 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: That's
input and output.

00:05:12.805 --> 00:05:13.605 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: So what are
your primary channels?

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Your mouth, you
speak, your hands

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.500 align:middle line:84%
for communicating on a
keyboard perhaps or the works

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.480 align:middle line:84%
that you create with
your hands and your mind.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And that has really been the
rule for many, many thousands

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:28.980 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Recently, we found with printed
word, with recorded sound,

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.720 align:middle line:84%
with video, we can transfer
a lot more experience

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.930 align:middle line:90%
and information.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.500 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, are
we using it properly?

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.480 align:middle line:84%
When we get into
the bandwidth that's

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.420 align:middle line:84%
available by directly
tapping into the brain,

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.580 align:middle line:84%
we suddenly have a
wealth of experience

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.260 align:middle line:84%
that can be transferred
from one person to another.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And recent
experiments have shown

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.970 align:middle line:84%
how you can actually transfer
memories or even alter or erase

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:55.770 align:middle line:90%
memories.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.630 align:middle line:84%
All of this is an
exploration to see

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.390 align:middle line:84%
how we can open up the brain
just like you can open up

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.790 align:middle line:84%
the hard drive of a computer and
have full access to it without,

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.700 align:middle line:84%
of course, destroying
the autonomy

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.425 align:middle line:90%
of the individual person.

00:06:07.425 --> 00:06:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Then you say this is
a function of nature that has

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.130 align:middle line:90%
limited it.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe there has been
any other kind of programming

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.560 align:middle line:90%
interference and so forth?

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Well, I would say
I don't see anything directly

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.540 align:middle line:90%
indicated.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.840 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that there
was never any real reason

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.580 align:middle line:84%
to change the amount
of input and output

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.220 align:middle line:84%
that any brain and
any animal had.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.678 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until we
developed spoken

00:06:30.678 --> 00:06:32.845 align:middle line:84%
and then written language
that we were able to do it

00:06:32.845 --> 00:06:33.940 align:middle line:90%
in any significant way.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you think
about it, libraries

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.610 align:middle line:84%
were the repositories
of knowledge,

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.480 align:middle line:84%
and even that became
a tool of warfare.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.470 align:middle line:84%
The Library of Alexandria
was destroyed twice

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.140 align:middle line:84%
because limiting the
knowledge and information

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.120 align:middle line:90%
of a culture made them weak.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.610 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have access
to the tools of the trade.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.010 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have access to
the information they'd saved.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.560 align:middle line:84%
So it actually became
a very negative thing

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.510 align:middle line:84%
to be able to destroy
all their information.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Today, of course, information
is stored everywhere

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.240 align:middle line:90%
and is available everywhere.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.920 align:middle line:84%
So the thought of losing
it all doesn't really

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.890 align:middle line:90%
make sense right now.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No, it doesn't
because of the cloud.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.885 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Correct.

00:07:12.885 --> 00:07:15.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so going back,
just for a moment before we

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:20.475 align:middle line:84%
move on here and dig down
into these technologies,

00:07:20.475 --> 00:07:22.800 align:middle line:84%
the transcendental part I
talked about a moment ago.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.840 align:middle line:84%
When we think of
Indigenous cultures,

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.840 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes they already had
more advanced technologies

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.550 align:middle line:90%
mentally--

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:84%
telepathy, the ability to
see beyond time and space,

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.500 align:middle line:84%
know when someone was coming,
remote view and all that,

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.560 align:middle line:84%
which really were our
innate human capacities.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And it seems as though those
were actually limited and shut

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.525 align:middle line:84%
down as we became more
sophisticated, more educated.

00:07:45.525 --> 00:07:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Well, I think one
of the things that has to be

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.080 align:middle line:84%
explored is how we always talk
about five senses but we really

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.280 align:middle line:90%
have far more than that.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Far more, yes.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Even the sensation
of being thirsty is a sense,

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.270 align:middle line:90%
the sensation of balance.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.610 align:middle line:84%
The vestibular system,
that's a sense.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:05.430 align:middle line:84%
We have a tendency to
raise a gate against noise.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.262 align:middle line:84%
So things that we
don't fully process,

00:08:07.262 --> 00:08:08.970 align:middle line:84%
things that happen in
the background that

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.460 align:middle line:84%
don't seem to have
significance in the moment,

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.785 align:middle line:90%
we tend to ignore.

00:08:12.785 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:84%
But the brain
doesn't forget them

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.480 align:middle line:84%
or doesn't ignore
them internally.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So people who are
creative appear

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.540 align:middle line:84%
to have the ability to
lower that noise threshold

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.352 align:middle line:90%
and still remain functional.

00:08:23.352 --> 00:08:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they always say
that many artists are mad,

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.630 align:middle line:84%
but that's a matter of
opinion, I would say.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.172 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
a matter of-- yeah,

00:08:29.172 --> 00:08:30.935 align:middle line:90%
insanity is a matter of opinion.

00:08:30.935 --> 00:08:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: But I would say that
we have many other channels

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.682 align:middle line:84%
of communication besides
body language and facial--

00:08:37.682 --> 00:08:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Verbal and--

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.039 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: --and non-verbal
communication that we use

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:43.260 align:middle line:84%
to transfer information
from other people.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And there could be other
channels we're not aware of.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't discount
the possibility.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.090 align:middle line:84%
I just know that what's
been most effective for us

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.930 align:middle line:84%
is what we're able to measure,
record, playback, see,

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.735 align:middle line:90%
and share on a very clear level.

00:08:57.735 --> 00:09:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, so that's
scientific materialism for you,

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.090 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:02.048 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: That's true.

00:09:02.048 --> 00:09:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.820 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about the Neuralink

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking
about interface with AI

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.420 align:middle line:84%
and its interface
with the brain.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's the first
thing that comes up

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.490 align:middle line:84%
in most people's minds
who look into this

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.080 align:middle line:90%
is Elon Musk's Neuralink.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And it frightens people because
they think, oh, my God, we're

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.083 align:middle line:84%
all going to be tethered to a
central computer and "Minority

00:09:22.083 --> 00:09:23.250 align:middle line:90%
Report" and everything else.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.000 align:middle line:84%
They're going to know
what we're thinking.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
first place that people

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.320 align:middle line:90%
who are concerned about AI go.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.230 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about the
reality of what it actually

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:84%
is, what it's designed
to do right now compared

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.075 align:middle line:84%
to what it's thought to
be used for in the future.

00:09:41.075 --> 00:09:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: All right.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.330 align:middle line:84%
So that is a valid
concern that we

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.730 align:middle line:84%
could be vulnerable to
more sorts of attacks

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:50.960 align:middle line:90%
we never imagined before.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.630 align:middle line:84%
But primarily,
what this is about

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:57.650 align:middle line:84%
is getting information out of
the human skull that can be

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.880 align:middle line:90%
used to help make life better.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And so the initial studies we're
looking at movement control.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
initial studies also

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.190 align:middle line:84%
showed that we could predict
from the firings of groups

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.590 align:middle line:84%
of neuro-cells neurons
in the brain, what

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.120 align:middle line:90%
you were thinking of doing.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And this could be translated
into actual commands

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.900 align:middle line:84%
to move a peripheral
such as a robotic limb

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.230 align:middle line:84%
or play a video game
or operate a machine.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And with the proper
technology, it

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.220 align:middle line:84%
could be routed to
a paralyzed limb

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.380 align:middle line:84%
so you could take
control of it once again.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So it was actually done
in really the true spirit

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.820 align:middle line:84%
of beneficiality, making
people able to live more fully

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.280 align:middle line:90%
and repair damage as occurred.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Wasn't it
specifically targeted for brain

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.430 align:middle line:90%
injury and spinal cord injury?

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Yes, that's
exactly correct.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.210 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
work done previously

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.630 align:middle line:84%
using compounds like oxytocin
and high levels of oxygen

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:54.560 align:middle line:84%
that allowed nerve
tissue to actually heal

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.855 align:middle line:90%
to a large degree.

00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:57.980 align:middle line:84%
But there are limits to
what can be done with that.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.910 align:middle line:84%
This allows you the ability
to actually bypass a missing

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.040 align:middle line:90%
chunk of nerve tissue.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.770 align:middle line:84%
If you can make a model
of a part of the brain

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.860 align:middle line:84%
and what it's doing and you
can replicate its function,

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.320 align:middle line:84%
you can then replace
that with something that

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.330 align:middle line:84%
isn't going to age or
wear out in the same way

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.580 align:middle line:90%
the brain tissue would.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not subject to disease
or chemicals or poisons.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.940 align:middle line:84%
It's something that actually
could be recorded and played

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.370 align:middle line:90%
back and restructured again.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So essentially, the
brain is encouraged to reroute

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.510 align:middle line:84%
that neural pathway to
another one that's functioning

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.385 align:middle line:84%
to create an original healthy
effect in movement or brain

00:11:35.385 --> 00:11:36.185 align:middle line:90%
function?

00:11:36.185 --> 00:11:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Well, in
some cases, that's true.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when there's
damage in the brain,

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.730 align:middle line:84%
portions of the brain undergo
a process called recruitment,

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.680 align:middle line:84%
where they gather
groups of neurons

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.860 align:middle line:84%
and retrain them to
act as surrogates

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.360 align:middle line:84%
for those portions
that are damaged.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't always
100% effective,

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:52.943 align:middle line:90%
but it's certainly useful.

00:11:52.943 --> 00:11:55.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the brain is a
very plastic, flexible,

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.430 align:middle line:90%
learning machine.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.820 align:middle line:84%
But what we're looking
at now is actually

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.935 align:middle line:84%
getting around damaged or
missing tissue perhaps.

00:12:00.935 --> 00:12:02.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The more that
recruitment part of the story.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Right.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.560 align:middle line:84%
You can't actually recruit
tissue that doesn't exist.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.810 align:middle line:84%
If you've had a tumor, for
instance, and let's say

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.820 align:middle line:84%
it affected your ability
to do mathematics,

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.290 align:middle line:90%
and they remove that tissue.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And now you're
unable to understand

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:17.052 align:middle line:84%
simple things like the number
line or what calculating is.

00:12:17.052 --> 00:12:19.010 align:middle line:84%
What if they came up with
a chip, for instance,

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.500 align:middle line:84%
that could model the
mathematical functional part

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.340 align:middle line:90%
of the brain?

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And they implant the chip
and you spent a few weeks

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.170 align:middle line:90%
learning to study how it works.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:29.270 align:middle line:84%
You become proficient,
and pretty soon you're

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.460 align:middle line:84%
calculating square roots
and numbers in your head

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:90%
like you never could.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.210 align:middle line:84%
But it raises a question,
are you actually thinking

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.200 align:middle line:90%
about the numbers?

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And so for some people,
that's a tricky thing.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:43.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a slippery-- you can't
really decide they feel.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:44.930 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.475 align:middle line:84%
If you're using a
calculator, are you

00:12:46.475 --> 00:12:47.600 align:middle line:90%
thinking about the numbers?

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Well, if you have
a calculator in your head that

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.600 align:middle line:84%
you didn't have to touch the
buttons on and you're still

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.090 align:middle line:84%
understanding what the concepts
are and how they function,

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:59.206 align:middle line:84%
I'd say that you're actually
thinking about the numbers.

00:12:59.206 --> 00:13:01.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're choosing
to instruct something,

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.720 align:middle line:84%
so it's a choice that
you've made to engage with

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.115 align:middle line:90%
the numbers.

00:13:04.115 --> 00:13:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: That's right.

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.728 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Even if the
calculation is happening

00:13:06.728 --> 00:13:09.420 align:middle line:84%
at lightning speed on some other
level that your natural brain

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:10.170 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't have come up with.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Exactly.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:11.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I mean, these are
all big philosophical questions

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.060 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about here.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Well, imagine
the ability to, let's say,

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.500 align:middle line:90%
replace individual neurons.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Let's suppose we had
some nanomachine that

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.570 align:middle line:84%
could go into the brain,
locate damaged tissue,

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.907 align:middle line:84%
and build valid copies,
working copies around--

00:13:29.907 --> 00:13:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that is what's
being worked on right now.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.157 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Yeah, eventually
we'll get to that.

00:13:34.157 --> 00:13:36.900 align:middle line:84%
But what would happen if, let's
say, every neuron of the brain

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:40.440 align:middle line:84%
was slowly replaced
by a machine neuron,

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.320 align:middle line:84%
and over the space of, like,
10 years every one of them

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.922 align:middle line:84%
got replaced until you were
nothing but nanoneurons?

00:13:46.922 --> 00:13:48.255 align:middle line:90%
Well, you'd still feel the same.

00:13:48.255 --> 00:13:49.710 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't notice
any difference.

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:51.835 align:middle line:84%
Your memories and experiences
would still be there.

00:13:51.835 --> 00:13:53.190 align:middle line:90%
Is it you?

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.020 align:middle line:84%
That's a very tough
question to answer.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, this is where
the esoteric part becomes very

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.140 align:middle line:90%
important.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is, those
who feel they actually

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.130 align:middle line:84%
have something beyond
the meat of the brain

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.220 align:middle line:84%
and those who feel they
have a spirit or soul.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.640 align:middle line:84%
In which case, if that's
permeating the brain,

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.450 align:middle line:84%
even if the functions have been
taken over mechanically, so

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:20.060 align:middle line:84%
to speak, how much affect
does that spirit or soul have?

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: And that raises a
question that actually leads

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:23.820 align:middle line:90%
to an experiment.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, tell me.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: If a part of
your brain is damaged,

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.670 align:middle line:90%
does it damage your soul?

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Because if it
does, then the soul

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.480 align:middle line:90%
is just as mutable as the brain.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't, then
why doesn't the soul

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.320 align:middle line:84%
move around the function of
that missing part of the brain?

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which
oftentimes it does.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.722 align:middle line:90%
We call it miracles.

00:14:43.722 --> 00:14:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: There do seem to
be miracles in the world.

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:47.560 align:middle line:90%
I can't deny that at all.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:47.956 align:middle line:84%
I've seen some
astounding things.

00:14:47.956 --> 00:14:50.123 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, but it's
not the most common thing.

00:14:50.123 --> 00:14:53.610 align:middle line:84%
But yes, it does exist where
for many people unaware,

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:84%
they're totally
unaware even of what's

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.880 align:middle line:84%
breaking down and
being corrected

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.978 align:middle line:90%
all the time on their behalf.

00:14:58.978 --> 00:15:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And so unless you're in
an accident and something

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.660 align:middle line:84%
severe like this happens,
you wouldn't know.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And then if it repairs
itself at that rate,

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:08.370 align:middle line:84%
you're talking what
looks like a miracle when

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:09.412 align:middle line:90%
it's just our capability.

00:15:09.412 --> 00:15:11.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: It's possibility.

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.920 align:middle line:84%
But I think that maybe what
we're going to discover

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.800 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of what we think
of as the soul ends up

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.290 align:middle line:84%
to be the data of
your experience

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:22.350 align:middle line:84%
and the data of how
you make decisions.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, there's no
question if somebody

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.228 align:middle line:84%
were to destroy your
brain you'd be gone.

00:15:27.228 --> 00:15:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You'd be gone.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:32.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Yet your soul,
your pattern of information

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:33.985 align:middle line:84%
and existence and
everything you've done--

00:15:33.985 --> 00:15:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Continues.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: --many
would argue continues.

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:37.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it becomes repository
known as the subconscious,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.115 align:middle line:84%
and you get to drag it
forward if you reincarnate.

00:15:42.115 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Well, and there's
something to think about.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the universe
has an effect on spacetime,

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.660 align:middle line:90%
on the vacuum itself.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Every charge, every movement,
every spin, everything does.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps what we refer to
as the soul is actually

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:00.950 align:middle line:90%
this imprint on spacetime.

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:02.075 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the thought.

00:16:02.075 --> 00:16:04.085 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, an
individuated imprint.

00:16:04.085 --> 00:16:05.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Could be.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:05.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, it is interesting
because that's

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.530 align:middle line:84%
where the philosophical
questions really

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:10.430 align:middle line:90%
start taking off.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.510 align:middle line:84%
We can go into all kinds
of territory with it.

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:13.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: True.

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.435 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But now sticking
to the terrestrial part

00:16:15.435 --> 00:16:19.400 align:middle line:84%
and the philosophical parts
over, who's running the brain?

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.180 align:middle line:84%
I was listening to an interview
with Elon Musk, whose company

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.440 align:middle line:90%
is creating the Neuralink.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And he says for
the next 10 years

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.140 align:middle line:84%
it's to be used for spinal
cord injury and brain damage.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And they're well on
their way in this now.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And he said in the end, AI
is going to be so ubiquitous,

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.100 align:middle line:84%
you're really only going to
have a choice of the provider.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.990 align:middle line:90%
And the provider which you--

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:48.410 align:middle line:84%
you, your biggest decision
will be who is that provider?

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:52.250 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand
what the capability to--

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:56.490 align:middle line:84%
for input and output from
that provider so that

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.220 align:middle line:84%
you don't step in a situation
in which someone else is playing

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.420 align:middle line:90%
God over your own brain.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Sure.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:05.310 align:middle line:84%
So I guess the question
is, which company do you

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:09.449 align:middle line:84%
trust to build brain replacement
parts and not install adware.

00:17:09.449 --> 00:17:11.323 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly, or malware.

00:17:11.323 --> 00:17:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: And here's
the other thought.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: If I'm baking a
cake, I don't go into the oven

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.810 align:middle line:84%
halfway through the process
and start adding things

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:19.650 align:middle line:90%
to the batter.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:21.869 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
be the same cake.

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, then what about the
growth and development

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.099 align:middle line:90%
of a mind, of a personality?

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:30.840 align:middle line:84%
At what point do you
decide that they're done

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.630 align:middle line:84%
and you can start
adding or subtracting?

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:middle line:90%
This is a very tricky question.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is tricky.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you just look
at basic brain development,

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.695 align:middle line:84%
no one should have anything
to do with it short

00:17:41.695 --> 00:17:44.790 align:middle line:84%
of serious injury before the
brain develops at age 28.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:47.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: That's pretty
much the way I feel about it.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: You don't want to
alter the normal development

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.268 align:middle line:84%
in ways that could result
in a person or personality

00:17:55.268 --> 00:17:57.810 align:middle line:84%
that's entirely different from
what was originally happening.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I
couldn't agree more.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.040 align:middle line:84%
So here you have
that, and then you

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.620 align:middle line:84%
have Musk saying, this
is another use of it,

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.120 align:middle line:90%
nothing to do with the human.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Now we're talking flat
out technological AI.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And he's oftentimes off in
his projections of time,

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.750 align:middle line:84%
and he'll say, I don't
know the timing on things.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm guessing, my best guess.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And his best guess
is that by 2050, it

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.330 align:middle line:84%
will be very common
for people to have

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.027 align:middle line:90%
household helpers, robots.

00:18:26.027 --> 00:18:27.735 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Well, I
would agree with that.

00:18:27.735 --> 00:18:30.193 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And he said they'll
be about the price of a car,

00:18:30.193 --> 00:18:34.630 align:middle line:84%
so most middle income and
up people can afford them.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have to
leave grandma alone

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.420 align:middle line:84%
for a couple of hours,
they'll be taken care of,

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.250 align:middle line:84%
but so will your
laundry, et cetera.

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And you see this in shows like
"Humans" and "Better Than Us."

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:46.890 align:middle line:90%
Do you watch any of those?

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:48.473 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: I haven't
seen any of them.

00:18:48.473 --> 00:18:51.007 align:middle line:84%
I have to admit, I stopped
watching TV 20 years ago.

00:18:51.007 --> 00:18:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, these are
streaming shows that are very

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:53.730 align:middle line:90%
targeted.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:54.870 align:middle line:90%
One is Russian.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.690 align:middle line:84%
One is British, but it's
getting into the subject

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.170 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about, what
happens, A, when you introduce

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:03.570 align:middle line:84%
these robots that
are better than us,

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:08.130 align:middle line:84%
more caring, stronger,
smarter into our lives?

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And what happens, if then
we're going to get into this,

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle line:90%
gain their own consciousness?

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.920 align:middle line:90%
Can start becoming self-aware.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: OK, so self-awareness
itself is a tricky thing.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons
it took decades

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.250 align:middle line:84%
to make any progress in
AI is a very simple one.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:25.380 align:middle line:90%
It's all linguistic.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.590 align:middle line:84%
We don't even agree on what
the definitions for thought

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.700 align:middle line:90%
and awareness and memory are.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And so this was one of the
major stumbling blocks.

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've pretty
much agreed that we

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:38.190 align:middle line:84%
can make things that function
very much like neurons

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:40.110 align:middle line:90%
and very much like brain tissue.

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And in fact,
building neural nets,

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.190 align:middle line:84%
we've discovered
that when they make

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.500 align:middle line:84%
failures occur in
them, many of them

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.150 align:middle line:84%
model failures in
the human brain,

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.240 align:middle line:90%
such as types of aphasias.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And so this is one
of the indicators

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.940 align:middle line:84%
that the neural nets are very
close to what nature is doing,

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.040 align:middle line:84%
and we learned a lot
from making models.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.680 align:middle line:84%
The problem with neural
nets is a simple one.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.340 align:middle line:84%
If you design and intentionally
build a specific device

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:10.410 align:middle line:84%
to act as a thinking system,
when you use neural nets,

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.420 align:middle line:84%
you have no idea what's
happening inside it

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.098 align:middle line:84%
and very little way
of interpreting it.

00:20:15.098 --> 00:20:16.890 align:middle line:84%
If you try to build
the same machine again,

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.020 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get a
different system because they

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.795 align:middle line:90%
learn at random, just as we do.

00:20:21.795 --> 00:20:24.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: With
experience and data input.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:25.413 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Exactly.

00:20:25.413 --> 00:20:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, you
could argue most humans

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:28.130 align:middle line:90%
aren't self-aware.

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So maybe this is a
conversation before its time.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:32.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Well, and
that's a tricky one.

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:35.940 align:middle line:84%
You could do another-- you
could do hours on that alone.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:40.950 align:middle line:84%
So your perspective
from what you understand

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:44.370 align:middle line:84%
is probably likely by 2050, this
will be a normal part of life,

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:46.840 align:middle line:84%
is to have a robot of
some kind to help us out

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:47.640 align:middle line:90%
around the house.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Absolutely.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.280 align:middle line:84%
But the big question
is, if it's smart enough

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.480 align:middle line:84%
to understand what you're
instructing it to do,

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.240 align:middle line:84%
why would it want to do
what you tell it and not

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.163 align:middle line:90%
what it wants to do?

00:20:57.163 --> 00:20:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
that's the thing,

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.860 align:middle line:84%
the whole notion
of will and desire.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.070 align:middle line:84%
So how do you write a
program around that does not

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.600 align:middle line:84%
include will and desire,
that literally only includes

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.400 align:middle line:90%
response?

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Well, even if you
didn't know the answer to that

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.370 align:middle line:84%
one, there's one tricky
thing you can do,

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:17.752 align:middle line:84%
and that is to build in a
desire to be happy working.

00:21:17.752 --> 00:21:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, there you go.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.748 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Boy, there's
a slippery slope,

00:21:20.748 --> 00:21:24.390 align:middle line:84%
because then it's only a few
minutes before somebody says,

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:25.970 align:middle line:84%
hey, we could do
this to people too.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.280 align:middle line:90%
And that's what scares people.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.605 align:middle line:90%
It sums it up in a nutshell.

00:21:29.605 --> 00:21:32.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, in one of
those two shows, I talked about,

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.175 align:middle line:84%
the Russian one called
"Better Than Us," of course,

00:21:34.175 --> 00:21:35.217 align:middle line:90%
it's absolutely gorgeous.

00:21:35.217 --> 00:21:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Drop dead, gorgeous, beautiful
robot comes into this family,

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:40.340 align:middle line:84%
and you can-- anyone
who wants to watch

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.780 align:middle line:84%
can look at the
rest of the plot.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:45.110 align:middle line:84%
But she was
defective, and she was

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:48.890 align:middle line:84%
sold by the Chinese in
a box without the manual

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:52.760 align:middle line:84%
at a discount to the
Russians, the oligarch.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And the reason was because
she had her own ideas.

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:58.940 align:middle line:84%
She was self-aware
that she was programmed

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:04.560 align:middle line:84%
to take care of a family
and to protect the family.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So when it came time to do
that, some murderous traits

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:09.620 align:middle line:90%
started coming out.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:12.860 align:middle line:84%
You do what you must
to meet the end goal.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.040 align:middle line:84%
So this brings a lot
of questions into it

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.450 align:middle line:84%
too about the programming of
such things in the future.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:22.025 align:middle line:84%
I find it fascinating
personally.

00:22:22.025 --> 00:22:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: I think that one of
the things we have to face is

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:28.130 align:middle line:84%
that most people at some point
can't even manage their own

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:29.510 align:middle line:90%
lives properly.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:32.450 align:middle line:84%
We all have
limitations and issues,

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:36.230 align:middle line:84%
but nobody wants to admit
to those limitations.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:39.675 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to trust a
group of limited, flawed humans

00:22:39.675 --> 00:22:40.550 align:middle line:90%
to create something--

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: To design a program--

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:42.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: --of perfection.

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.615 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: That, that is an
extremely dangerous thing.

00:22:45.615 --> 00:22:47.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
that's a slippery one.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.040 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.065 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
Synchron Corporation.

00:22:50.065 --> 00:22:51.440 align:middle line:84%
So we talked about
the Neuralink,

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.292 align:middle line:84%
which is putting a disk
basically right here

00:22:53.292 --> 00:22:54.125 align:middle line:90%
in the skull, right?

00:22:54.125 --> 00:22:54.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Correct.

00:22:54.925 --> 00:22:56.947 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And now,
we'll talk about that,

00:22:56.947 --> 00:22:57.780 align:middle line:90%
what came out of it.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.680 align:middle line:90%
But this is a little different.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.242 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about it-- who
they are, what they're doing,

00:23:03.242 --> 00:23:04.700 align:middle line:84%
and how far they've
gotten with it.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Well, one of
the early founding members

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.890 align:middle line:84%
of Synchron actually worked
with Neuralink on the project

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:10.710 align:middle line:90%
for a while.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And when he left, he had
some dissatisfaction,

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.130 align:middle line:84%
which I won't go into
any of the details.

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:19.310 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is he got
to work with Synchron.

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And Synchron had a
slightly different way

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:22.730 align:middle line:90%
of approaching it.

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:25.340 align:middle line:84%
With Neuralink, you
must open the skull

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:29.193 align:middle line:84%
to get the chip in contact
with a portion of the brain.

00:23:29.193 --> 00:23:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, you're
going to look at the area known

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.410 align:middle line:90%
where the homunculus resides.

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:35.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a model of the body.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And that way, it can
read information from it

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:39.252 align:middle line:84%
and determine what the
movements are going to be,

00:23:39.252 --> 00:23:40.640 align:middle line:90%
make predictions.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.250 align:middle line:10%
Synchron has a
different type of device

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:10%
that actually works in the
same way a cardiac stent would.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:51.500 align:middle line:84%
The electrode array is
inserted through an artery

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:52.550 align:middle line:90%
into the brain.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.740 align:middle line:90%
They steer it into the location.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.730 align:middle line:84%
They implant this stent,
and it makes the connections

00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:59.570 align:middle line:90%
through there.

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually
go home after 48 hours

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:03.140 align:middle line:90%
after the surgery.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:03.940 align:middle line:90%
It's very--

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.705 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Did you say the
blood flowing through the stent?

00:24:05.705 --> 00:24:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: That's correct.

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:08.060 align:middle line:90%
It's like a collar.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.070 align:middle line:84%
You can slightly
expand the blood vessel

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:12.980 align:middle line:84%
without obscuring the
blood flow or obstructing,

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.090 align:middle line:90%
and I should say.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:18.770 align:middle line:84%
So they actually implanted
the devices, the test devices

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:22.160 align:middle line:84%
from Synchron in 2018
in an Australian man

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.590 align:middle line:84%
who very rapidly learned
how to send texts

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.130 align:middle line:90%
by thinking about it.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:28.820 align:middle line:84%
So this is a direct
and very useful

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.670 align:middle line:84%
application particularly
for people who are locked in

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.740 align:middle line:84%
or are unable to move or unable
to communicate in any way.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:38.510 align:middle line:84%
If you can get somebody who is
totally paralyzed to the point

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:40.940 align:middle line:84%
where they can communicate
by sending texts,

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.553 align:middle line:84%
you've taken a
major step forward

00:24:42.553 --> 00:24:44.720 align:middle line:84%
in improving their quality
of life and understanding

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.785 align:middle line:90%
what's going on.

00:24:45.785 --> 00:24:48.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I think what
comes to mind is a friend

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:51.920 align:middle line:84%
of mine, dear friend,
lifelong friend.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Interesting, this gets
into a lot of stuff.

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:56.060 align:middle line:84%
When she retired
didn't really want

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.070 align:middle line:84%
to but her husband
wanted her to.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:59.510 align:middle line:90%
She didn't want to stay home.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:03.920 align:middle line:84%
As soon as she retired, weird
thing happened in her brain.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Tau protein build
up in the brain,

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and she very quickly
started falling

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:11.090 align:middle line:84%
into a state similar to Stephen
Hawking, the most frustrating

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:13.400 align:middle line:84%
part being that
she couldn't speak

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.830 align:middle line:84%
and found a way to
communicate, but her mind

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:18.080 align:middle line:90%
was perfectly intact.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think she did end her life
with assisted suicide, legal.

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
would have happened

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:26.450 align:middle line:90%
had that been available?

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Right.

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously, restoring
the ability to communicate

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.390 align:middle line:90%
is wonderful.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:35.720 align:middle line:84%
But if you can't stop
the damage, what's

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.580 align:middle line:84%
causing the damage,
it may spread

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.450 align:middle line:90%
to other areas of the brain.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:43.160 align:middle line:84%
So it sounds like a panacea,
just put this thing in.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.840 align:middle line:84%
But if the rest of the brain
is still failing rapidly,

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.120 align:middle line:90%
it's a problem.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Learning how to remove
tissue without affecting

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:52.490 align:middle line:84%
the surrounding tissue
can be very tricky.

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:55.333 align:middle line:84%
The brain actually has
pretty localized processors.

00:25:55.333 --> 00:25:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at it, people
say the brain is a computer.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.910 align:middle line:84%
It actually is a
network of computers,

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:01.530 align:middle line:90%
each with special functions.

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:04.920 align:middle line:84%
It's estimated that there are
about 250 different processes

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.420 align:middle line:84%
running inside the human
brain at any given moment.

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And so if you look at
it from this standpoint,

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:13.260 align:middle line:84%
it really is a network
of complex computers,

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.270 align:middle line:84%
each with a dedicated
process going on in it.

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:19.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you could locate and
remove just that section,

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.990 align:middle line:84%
then you'd stand a
far greater chance

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:24.120 align:middle line:84%
of returning them to
a normal form of life

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.995 align:middle line:84%
once you get this
implant in place.

00:26:25.995 --> 00:26:29.563 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So the possibility
here is that this can happen.

00:26:29.563 --> 00:26:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Absolutely.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You look at it--

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:35.610 align:middle line:84%
again, me I'm big on
the soul and the human.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:37.740 align:middle line:84%
What was the desired
outcome there?

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:40.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
home hanging out

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.520 align:middle line:84%
in the house with
my husband all day.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.390 align:middle line:84%
So she's not, so
you got that too.

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:49.410 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the algorithms that

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:56.130 align:middle line:84%
are used and mimicking behavior
and thought versus the ability

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:57.850 align:middle line:90%
for AI to originate.

00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Right.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:26:59.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.150 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, there are
two major schools of thought

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:04.770 align:middle line:90%
on artificial intelligence.

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:08.047 align:middle line:84%
First is the weak AI claim, the
second is the strong AI claim.

00:27:08.047 --> 00:27:09.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And tell
us what those are.

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: OK, so in
the weak AI claim,

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:15.240 align:middle line:84%
it's claimed that we may
never understand what thought

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.040 align:middle line:84%
and being and
consciousness actually is.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.990 align:middle line:84%
But we make systems that
can imitate it more and more

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.830 align:middle line:90%
accurately.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And we can keep
adding pieces that

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.300 align:middle line:84%
get better and better at
imitating it to the point

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:29.310 align:middle line:84%
where we can't tell the
difference that it won't

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:31.140 align:middle line:84%
actually be
thinking, but it will

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.380 align:middle line:84%
be acting like it is so
effectively that it fools us.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.360 align:middle line:90%
That's the weak AI claim.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.510 align:middle line:84%
The strong AI claim is we
can figure out exactly.

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:40.510 align:middle line:90%
We can duplicate it.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:43.330 align:middle line:84%
We can make a system
that does exactly that.

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:48.000 align:middle line:84%
So while it may be
exactly a thinker,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.030 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't guarantee that it
will think like a human being.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:52.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, consider all
the different species

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.217 align:middle line:84%
of animals on this
Earth that have

00:27:54.217 --> 00:27:58.090 align:middle line:84%
some sort of mental
horsepower, and they act very,

00:27:58.090 --> 00:27:59.940 align:middle line:84%
very differently
from human beings

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.990 align:middle line:84%
because of how
they have to live.

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:04.290 align:middle line:84%
So there can be
any type of a mind,

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:07.380 align:middle line:84%
but it could be valid and
alive and aware and thinking.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.690 align:middle line:84%
So when we come up
with this strong AI,

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:11.670 align:middle line:84%
how do we know,
how to influence it

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:14.810 align:middle line:90%
to be the way we want it to be?

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, we'll
end up training it.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.270 align:middle line:84%
We can make modules
of neural networks.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Isn't that just
instantiating preferences?

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:24.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Well, it is.

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.580 align:middle line:84%
But to start with,
every one of us

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:31.210 align:middle line:84%
comes with a whole sheaf of
pre-programs in our brain.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that's
the subconscious for you.

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Well,
I mean, consider,

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:37.790 align:middle line:84%
if you pick up a puppy
and hold it over water,

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.190 align:middle line:90%
it starts paddling.

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:41.470 align:middle line:90%
How does it know to do that?

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that a baby
will start when there's

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:46.750 align:middle line:90%
a loud noise or a flash?

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.280 align:middle line:84%
It's because they're
wired to do that.

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:51.520 align:middle line:84%
So it isn't cheating
to start with a bunch

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.107 align:middle line:90%
of starter routines in the AI.

00:28:53.107 --> 00:28:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you're
saying that-- say that,

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:57.220 align:middle line:84%
call it subconscious or
what starter routines.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:00.610 align:middle line:84%
You can call it collective
passed-on knowledge, DNA,

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:01.900 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to call it.

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.810 align:middle line:84%
You're saying that that
subtle information will

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:07.462 align:middle line:90%
begin programming AI itself.

00:29:07.462 --> 00:29:09.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: It will shape
how it develops and what its

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:10.470 align:middle line:90%
intentions--

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:13.165 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is that because
we are responding to it,

00:29:13.165 --> 00:29:15.040 align:middle line:84%
which we respond to
subconscious programming?

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Well, we are
responding to the needs

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:19.570 align:middle line:90%
of our body to keep it alive.

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget that
the target is to keep

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:25.290 align:middle line:84%
you alive, safe, reproducing,
taking care of your family,

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:26.090 align:middle line:90%
and going on.

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which I think is
the point of the subconscious,

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.090 align:middle line:90%
is to keep us alive.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: That's right.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:32.890 align:middle line:84%
We are very complicated
machines, our bodies are.

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And our brain is a
cheap and easy tool

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.360 align:middle line:90%
to do it very effectively.

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we are the dominant
species on the planet,

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.500 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.300 align:middle line:90%
And how is it?

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.660 align:middle line:90%
We don't run real fast.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.870 align:middle line:84%
We don't have claws or scales,
giant teeth, or poison,

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:49.030 align:middle line:84%
or any of those
sorts of defenses

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:50.230 align:middle line:90%
that other organisms do.

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:51.670 align:middle line:90%
And yet we took over the planet.

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And it only happened
because we can make

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:58.090 align:middle line:90%
abstract models of reality.

00:29:58.090 --> 00:29:59.230 align:middle line:90%
We're predictors.

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.450 align:middle line:84%
We go through our
lives, modeling,

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:03.650 align:middle line:84%
learning, and predicting
what happens next.

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:06.700 align:middle line:84%
But this also leads you to how
a machine can have emotion.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.105 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK,
let's talk about--

00:30:08.105 --> 00:30:08.905 align:middle line:90%
OK, so now--

00:30:08.905 --> 00:30:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Sure.

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:09.756 align:middle line:90%
We'll get to that, of course.

00:30:09.756 --> 00:30:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: All right.

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:12.050 align:middle line:84%
We'll get into that
right from this.

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:15.370 align:middle line:84%
So the subconscious is
something, this collective body

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:20.246 align:middle line:84%
of unconscious knowledge that
we carry with, we're born with.

00:30:20.246 --> 00:30:21.910 align:middle line:90%
This creates reaction.

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And usually, it has to
do with survival, right?

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be pleasure,
fear, invite something in,

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.320 align:middle line:90%
reject something.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:35.770 align:middle line:84%
So if the AI is interfacing
with our reactions,

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:38.440 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
building its own database

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.582 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the reactions
of the AI, right?

00:30:40.582 --> 00:30:41.665 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: That's correct.

00:30:41.665 --> 00:30:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it doesn't
really matter if--

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.697 align:middle line:84%
it's learning it
one way or the-- it

00:30:46.697 --> 00:30:48.280 align:middle line:84%
may be learning from
our subconscious,

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.505 align:middle line:84%
but it is learning the correct
responses for that individual.

00:30:51.505 --> 00:30:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Right.

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have a value
assigned to everything

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.050 align:middle line:90%
we experience and know.

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:56.967 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:30:56.967 --> 00:30:59.680 align:middle line:90%
So now let's get into emotions.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: So prediction
is the big thing here.

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And we all feel emotion
or we think we do.

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:07.940 align:middle line:90%
And I think that I--

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.160 align:middle line:84%
the best illustration is
you've been in the hospital

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:10.993 align:middle line:90%
to have a procedure.

00:31:10.993 --> 00:31:13.400 align:middle line:90%
You're anesthetized or drugs.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling as
they're wheeling you in,

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:19.100 align:middle line:84%
I should be scared or
worried, but I just

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.300 align:middle line:90%
feel nothing right now.

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel fear.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.020 align:middle line:90%
I should feel this way.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And we've all been in an
altered state of some sort

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.640 align:middle line:84%
under medication or something
where we felt that way.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Or meditating.

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:30.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:31.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: And so
the question is,

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:33.857 align:middle line:84%
if you know you should
feel that emotion,

00:31:33.857 --> 00:31:34.940 align:middle line:90%
but you're not feeling it.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:35.640 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:36.710 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is simple.

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:38.780 align:middle line:90%
You don't feel emotion.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:42.620 align:middle line:84%
What you feel is the
body's visceral response

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.943 align:middle line:84%
to the chemicals that
emotional thinking

00:31:44.943 --> 00:31:46.235 align:middle line:90%
releases into your bloodstream.

00:31:46.235 --> 00:31:48.935 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Difference
between emotion and feeling.

00:31:48.935 --> 00:31:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: That's exactly it.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:55.000 align:middle line:84%
So an emotion, emotion
is the brain's earliest

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.890 align:middle line:84%
capable-- nature's earliest
capability of rational response

00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:00.650 align:middle line:90%
to a danger or an opportunity.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I better run, terrifying.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, so emotion is
a type of thinking,

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:07.430 align:middle line:84%
and it's meant to
keep you alive.

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:08.563 align:middle line:90%
So it's act in a moment--

00:32:08.563 --> 00:32:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, I
agree with that.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: --without
rational thought.

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And rational thoughts
are expensive.

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:14.672 align:middle line:90%
It takes a lot of brain tissue.

00:32:14.672 --> 00:32:16.220 align:middle line:90%
Emotions, easy and cheap.

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.230 align:middle line:90%
But how does it work?

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:22.220 align:middle line:84%
It's because emotion releases
compounds into your bloodstream

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.510 align:middle line:90%
that change--

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:25.940 align:middle line:84%
the racing pulse
begins, the tightening

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:28.493 align:middle line:84%
of the muscles, the sweating
palms, the hyperalert feeling.

00:32:28.493 --> 00:32:29.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Adrenaline, yeah.

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Right.

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And what you feel
is not emotion.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.550 align:middle line:84%
You're feeling your
body's response

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:35.900 align:middle line:90%
to the chemistry of emotion.

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.670 align:middle line:84%
So now let's take that
to the next stage.

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:39.890 align:middle line:90%
How do we put it in a machine?

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Being predictors, we
know from our experience

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.380 align:middle line:84%
what's going to happen next
every stage of the day.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.480 align:middle line:84%
We're evaluating when we
walk through a door, when

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.490 align:middle line:84%
we pick something up,
when we taste something,

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:51.650 align:middle line:90%
we know what it should be.

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:53.790 align:middle line:84%
So you've been indoors
all day, long day.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:54.590 align:middle line:90%
You step out.

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:56.330 align:middle line:90%
You're going to take a break.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.678 align:middle line:84%
Afternoon, you see a
rock on the ground.

00:32:58.678 --> 00:32:59.720 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't there before.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.605 align:middle line:90%
You go to pick it up.

00:33:00.605 --> 00:33:02.953 align:middle line:84%
You know it's going
to have a heft to it.

00:33:02.953 --> 00:33:03.870 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be hard.

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:05.000 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be hot
from sitting in the sun.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:05.800 align:middle line:90%
You pick it up.

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.928 align:middle line:84%
It's cold and squishy,
Oh, what just happened?

00:33:07.928 --> 00:33:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
it's something else.

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:11.178 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Violation
of your expectation.

00:33:11.178 --> 00:33:11.978 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:33:11.978 --> 00:33:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: All right.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very good.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: How does that work?

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:17.720 align:middle line:84%
The machine is programmed
to become a predictor, like,

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.120 align:middle line:84%
a human being, to gauge
from moment to moment

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.080 align:middle line:90%
what's going to happen.

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And its expectations
can be violated.

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:25.700 align:middle line:90%
Flag is set.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.050 align:middle line:84%
It's got the basis of
the emotion of surprise

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:28.850 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:30.500 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't feel it.

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:35.450 align:middle line:84%
How do you bring the machine to
feel the emotional sensations

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:36.680 align:middle line:90%
that we do?

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.650 align:middle line:84%
You model a body
for it, whether it's

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.140 align:middle line:84%
in a virtual space or
an actual robot body.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.270 align:middle line:90%
You give it sensory feedback.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:47.510 align:middle line:84%
You give it the response
to increase the current

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:50.150 align:middle line:84%
to the motors so they move a
little harder, a little faster,

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:51.790 align:middle line:90%
automatically.

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:54.970 align:middle line:84%
You give it the same
sorts of scenarios

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:57.130 align:middle line:84%
that are wired into
a living being,

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and it will actually feel that
if it has any sort of tactile

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:02.090 align:middle line:90%
and feedback system.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:04.325 align:middle line:84%
Then it will actually
feel emotion.

00:34:04.325 --> 00:34:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so now
this gets us to VR,

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:11.970 align:middle line:84%
where you're talking about the
senses now engaging with AI.

00:34:11.970 --> 00:34:18.449 align:middle line:84%
And I just can't help but feel
we got some big changes coming

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:19.249 align:middle line:90%
in society--

00:34:19.249 --> 00:34:20.166 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Yes, we do.

00:34:20.166 --> 00:34:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --with the
introduction of VR.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.179 align:middle line:84%
People worry about the
world's population explosion.

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:31.190 align:middle line:84%
We just passed 8 million the
other day, well, ostensibly.

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:34.643 align:middle line:84%
But with VR, that could
definitely slow things down.

00:34:34.643 --> 00:34:35.726 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Well, it could.

00:34:35.726 --> 00:34:36.110 align:middle line:90%
It could.

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It could.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:39.415 align:middle line:84%
Just because you can
have every experience

00:34:39.415 --> 00:34:40.790 align:middle line:84%
you need without
having to engage

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:41.854 align:middle line:90%
with a complicated human.

00:34:41.854 --> 00:34:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: And
that's probably true.

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And here's why we're
limited right now.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Virtual reality
systems can give you

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:52.450 align:middle line:84%
a scenario, can give you
objects to move around.

00:34:52.450 --> 00:34:55.690 align:middle line:84%
It can give you a world to react
in that's similar to this one,

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:58.490 align:middle line:84%
identical to this one,
or wildly different.

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:01.340 align:middle line:84%
But what it doesn't
supply is anything more

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:05.837 align:middle line:84%
than the very basics,
sound and sight.

00:35:05.837 --> 00:35:07.670 align:middle line:84%
If those are the only
two channels you have,

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:09.290 align:middle line:90%
it can be pretty convincing.

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:11.210 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have
taste or smell.

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It doesn't have
tactile capabilities now.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Some do, some do.

00:35:15.245 --> 00:35:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's where
they're headed, though.

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:17.270 align:middle line:90%
That's the Holy Grail.

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: That's
where it's headed.

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:20.220 align:middle line:90%
So how do you do it?

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all,
there's a device

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:24.710 align:middle line:84%
that affects your
vestibular or balance

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:28.430 align:middle line:84%
system by placing a pair of
electrodes behind your ears.

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And by putting slight
charges on them, patterned

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:33.320 align:middle line:84%
in certain ways,
it can change how

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.210 align:middle line:84%
you feel right or
left up or down,

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:37.100 align:middle line:90%
how your balance is affected.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:40.040 align:middle line:84%
A headset with this was
demonstrated a few years back.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:43.520 align:middle line:84%
In Japan, they put the headset
on a woman and using a joystick

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.530 align:middle line:84%
changed her sense of
balance so she would

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:46.880 align:middle line:90%
steer to the right or the left.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And she felt like the
ground was tilting.

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:54.110 align:middle line:84%
They actually were making a plan
to produce these in headsets

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:57.260 align:middle line:84%
so you could get vestibular
balance sensations out

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:58.370 align:middle line:90%
of some games.

00:35:58.370 --> 00:36:00.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
stood in the way of it.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:03.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not a difficult technology,
but it would give one more

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:08.120 align:middle line:84%
really convincing
sense to the impression

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.725 align:middle line:90%
that you're in another world.

00:36:09.725 --> 00:36:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: True.

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:13.310 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that technology
would be better used

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:15.620 align:middle line:84%
to help people who have lost
their balance regain it.

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: And
that's another thing.

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:20.105 align:middle line:84%
It will work if the
nerves are not destroyed.

00:36:20.105 --> 00:36:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I see.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: There's
always a limitation.

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:25.400 align:middle line:84%
You can have an implant
for your hearing,

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.840 align:middle line:84%
but if the auditory nerves
have already been destroyed,

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.040 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't do you any good.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.490 align:middle line:84%
So there has to be some wiring
to support the hardware.

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:32.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:33.747 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: But the
other thing is,

00:36:33.747 --> 00:36:36.020 align:middle line:84%
how do you get other
tactile sensations?

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:38.420 align:middle line:84%
There were movie theaters
who would do things

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:41.690 align:middle line:84%
like vibrate the seats, blow
smells, hot air, cold air,

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:42.560 align:middle line:90%
or mist.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And that was probably
the closest approach

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.430 align:middle line:90%
they had at the time.

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Right now, there are
talks of inserting

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:53.830 align:middle line:84%
chips inside nerve endings
that can create sensations--

00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:55.845 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And create
a scent or a smell.

00:36:55.845 --> 00:36:56.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Exactly.

00:36:56.645 --> 00:36:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: So this
is not far away.

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And some of the things
we learned from Neuralink

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:02.870 align:middle line:84%
and Synchron and other
related projects,

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.210 align:middle line:84%
one of the things we've
learned is that you can record,

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:07.400 align:middle line:84%
generate, or playback
neural signals,

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.870 align:middle line:84%
and the brain cannot distinguish
them from the real thing.

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:12.810 align:middle line:90%
So that's on the way.

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:15.540 align:middle line:84%
It's invasive at this time,
but it is a technology

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:16.710 align:middle line:90%
that's going to appear.

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:18.345 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see it
first in people

00:37:18.345 --> 00:37:20.970 align:middle line:84%
who have lost sensation in limb
or something along those lines.

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.387 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
that makes sense,

00:37:22.387 --> 00:37:25.600 align:middle line:84%
anything that will help restore
for a person who still has

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:26.400 align:middle line:90%
the will to live.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Yes.

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's the thing.

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:33.360 align:middle line:90%
So how do you see VR?

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.980 align:middle line:84%
As we're seeing
it, like, they'll

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.500 align:middle line:84%
have someone in the
airport giving you

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.390 align:middle line:90%
free VR demonstrations.

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:41.530 align:middle line:84%
I think Facebook had
a booth doing that,

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:43.860 align:middle line:84%
so in the Phoenix
airport at one point.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.660 align:middle line:90%
How do you see VR?

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Because it is so rapidly coming
up now for the average person.

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.980 align:middle line:84%
How do you see that playing
out, the most popular uses,

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:56.130 align:middle line:84%
the most perhaps surprising
or intriguing uses?

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:58.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: I think that one
of the earliest uses that

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.620 align:middle line:84%
we'll see for VR will
be avatar bodies.

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:03.390 align:middle line:84%
So you can tour other
parts of the world

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:05.250 align:middle line:90%
without going anywhere.

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:06.930 align:middle line:90%
You put on a headset.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Italy, put $5 in, walk around
in Italy for a few minutes.

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that's been
long thought about and talked

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:15.160 align:middle line:84%
about in a lot of
fiction, and some people

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.790 align:middle line:90%
have actually made a go of it.

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Replacement
for remote viewing.

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Well, yes, it's
technical remote viewing.

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.390 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to
visit other lands

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:27.180 align:middle line:84%
and have other
experiences with an avatar

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:30.010 align:middle line:84%
body acting on your
behalf in those locations.

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:31.322 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to come.

00:38:31.322 --> 00:38:32.280 align:middle line:90%
We're very close to it.

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:34.140 align:middle line:84%
I think there are some companies
experimenting with it right

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:34.940 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:37.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so what are some
other uses of it that we might

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:38.745 align:middle line:90%
be surprised by?

00:38:38.745 --> 00:38:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Well, consider
working in very hazardous

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:46.260 align:middle line:84%
locations, like, power plants
on fire or places where

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:47.910 align:middle line:84%
there's biological
contamination.

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:51.000 align:middle line:84%
You can send in
robot avatar bodies

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.380 align:middle line:84%
and live humans
on the other end.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.463 align:middle line:84%
Put the headset on, put
their hands in the gloves,

00:38:54.463 --> 00:38:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and they become the worker
in a hazard location.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:01.270 align:middle line:84%
Ocean floor, surface of the
moon, other places like that.

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:05.040 align:middle line:84%
So this means that we
can take the flesh, which

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:08.430 align:middle line:84%
is so fallible and
easy to damage,

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:11.170 align:middle line:84%
and replace it like
putting on a glove.

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:12.100 align:middle line:90%
We do it already.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.200 align:middle line:90%
We get in our car.

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:17.580 align:middle line:84%
You can't run 70 miles per hour
in freezing snow on a highway,

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:18.990 align:middle line:90%
but you do it every day.

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:20.820 align:middle line:84%
You put on your
vehicle, and you've

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:24.570 align:middle line:84%
learned a body image that
makes you treat it as if it's

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:26.620 align:middle line:90%
an extension of yourself.

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:30.960 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the big, big
up and coming expansion points

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:31.870 align:middle line:90%
for virtual reality.

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:32.535 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's useful.

00:39:32.535 --> 00:39:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Very useful.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Of course, what we're
really going to see is lots

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:36.720 align:middle line:90%
of games and--

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Of course,
millions of-- ugh.

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:40.230 align:middle line:90%
Don't get me going.

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:44.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now let's talk about
the word "transhumanism."

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: OK.

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:47.005 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Where
do these intersect?

00:39:47.005 --> 00:39:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: All right.

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:51.160 align:middle line:84%
So transhumanism, a lot of
people are aware of this,

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:53.020 align:middle line:84%
simply means going
beyond the limits

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:54.590 align:middle line:90%
of your body in some way.

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And the very first person who
replaced their arm with a hook,

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:00.550 align:middle line:90%
that's a bit of transhumanism.

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:04.000 align:middle line:84%
Mitral valves in the
heart, artificial kidneys,

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.940 align:middle line:84%
all of these things are bits
and pieces of transhumanism.

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're reaching a stage
now where we actually

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:13.640 align:middle line:84%
can enhance the capabilities
of the human body,

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.630 align:middle line:84%
whether it's with adding
certain mechanisms

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:18.682 align:middle line:84%
or extending the
range of your senses.

00:40:18.682 --> 00:40:20.890 align:middle line:84%
There have been experiments
that give you the ability

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:25.390 align:middle line:84%
to see infrared by injecting
new dyes into the eye

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:29.470 align:middle line:84%
so that you literally can see in
what looks like total darkness.

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So this is coming, and
it's coming rapidly.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:35.980 align:middle line:84%
We see the fact that our body
is a vehicle made of meat.

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:39.880 align:middle line:84%
What do we do to make it
more durable, more permanent,

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:42.495 align:middle line:84%
non-damageable to extend
the range of what we do?

00:40:42.495 --> 00:40:43.870 align:middle line:84%
If you want real
space travelers,

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:45.970 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
mechanical bodies, something

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:48.590 align:middle line:84%
that can't be destroyed
by cosmic rays and vacuum

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:49.390 align:middle line:90%
and heat.

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's on the way,
and we'll see it

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:55.420 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning as medical
research to replace limbs,

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:56.875 align:middle line:90%
damaged tissue, whatever.

00:40:56.875 --> 00:40:58.099 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We've got nanobots
going and repairing damaged

00:40:58.099 --> 00:40:58.180 align:middle line:90%
organs.

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: And nanobots,
whatever it takes.

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:01.600 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.910 align:middle line:84%
But we're already
nanotechnology.

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Life itself is natural
nanotechnology.

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Explain
what you mean by that.

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:13.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: So life is a process
of molecules acting together

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:16.030 align:middle line:84%
in a certain way so that the
system gathers information,

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:19.690 align:middle line:84%
makes copies of itself using
outside energy and fuel.

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:20.750 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:22.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, every plant does it.

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:23.560 align:middle line:90%
A germ does it.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:29.110 align:middle line:84%
We're reaching a stage where we
will change our bodies in a way

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:32.410 align:middle line:84%
that the nanotechnology
of nature, which is just

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:36.370 align:middle line:84%
molecular machinery working
together to copy a gene

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:39.112 align:middle line:84%
and make a protein of it, that's
what's happening in your cells.

00:41:39.112 --> 00:41:40.570 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
transfer all of that

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:43.540 align:middle line:84%
over to very much
more durable material

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.660 align:middle line:84%
so that we ourselves aren't
subject to illnesses.

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Or if you did break
an arm off, you

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:51.550 align:middle line:84%
could get it regrown or
add it on in a few minutes,

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:54.340 align:middle line:90%
and it wouldn't be a giant loss.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:57.520 align:middle line:84%
So transhumanism is going
beyond the limits of what

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.940 align:middle line:90%
it is to be a human being.

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're going
to see a lot of it

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:05.710 align:middle line:84%
in early medical devices for
damaged limbs and systems.

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:08.800 align:middle line:84%
We'll later see extensions
in neural implants that

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:13.870 align:middle line:84%
increase your speed of thinking
or clarity of senses or memory,

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:15.130 align:middle line:90%
and it's just going to grow.

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:18.108 align:middle line:84%
At some point, we're going
to be merged with machinery

00:42:18.108 --> 00:42:19.150 align:middle line:90%
the way things are going.

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps that
might be the solution

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:25.390 align:middle line:84%
to an impending machine disaster
that people imagine coming.

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:29.650 align:middle line:84%
If we're all part of the same
race of humans and machines,

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:31.540 align:middle line:84%
then there can't
really be any sort

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.260 align:middle line:90%
of a conflict between the two.

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:36.296 align:middle line:84%
And that's what a lot of people
see as being the solution.

00:42:36.296 --> 00:42:39.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: As long as
we have sovereignty.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:41.342 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Mental sovereignty.

00:42:41.342 --> 00:42:42.425 align:middle line:90%
It's personal sovereignty.

00:42:42.425 --> 00:42:46.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Personal, mental
sovereignty over the processes.

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:47.690 align:middle line:90%
And as long as--

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:50.810 align:middle line:84%
because I do believe
in soul/spirit

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:54.980 align:middle line:84%
and having it integrated with
essentially all information

00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:57.500 align:middle line:84%
and bringing back
a piece of that

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:01.130 align:middle line:84%
and having that animate
choices and decisions in life.

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:05.600 align:middle line:84%
If the soul/spirit
complex can continue

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:11.420 align:middle line:84%
to merge with this new
and improved system,

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:13.070 align:middle line:90%
you still have a human being.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Well,
you would think so.

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:16.010 align:middle line:90%
The issue is--

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:17.465 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm just playing
with it in my head myself--

00:43:17.465 --> 00:43:17.916 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Oh, no, absolutely.

00:43:17.916 --> 00:43:19.975 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --because I've been
pretty very anti-transhumanism.

00:43:19.975 --> 00:43:21.858 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: We have to
ask these questions.

00:43:21.858 --> 00:43:23.150 align:middle line:90%
We have to know where we stand.

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And when you start thinking
about it, what makes you you?

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And people would say,
well, all your memories.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.360 align:middle line:84%
But there's more
to it than that.

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Your memories are only
half of the equation.

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:38.420 align:middle line:90%
You have procedures.

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:41.450 align:middle line:84%
You have memories
of your experiences.

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And you have the
procedures you've

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.220 align:middle line:84%
learned to make decisions
and handle those memories,

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:47.480 align:middle line:90%
how to respond.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.980 align:middle line:84%
So there's at least
two sets of data

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:52.220 align:middle line:84%
right there that you would need
to make your mind what it is.

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Indeed.

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And so the final
question, because this

00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:59.060 align:middle line:90%
supersedes everything.

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:01.550 align:middle line:84%
We know there have
been periods of history

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:05.130 align:middle line:84%
recorded where people have
lived much longer spans of time.

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the ability
to live longer, healthfully,

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and so forth is already
built into the code

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:12.120 align:middle line:90%
if we knew how to crack it.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And so the brain itself,
the spirit brain complex

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.680 align:middle line:84%
has the ability to do what
we perceive as miracles.

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.960 align:middle line:84%
So it would then
lend to the argument

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.270 align:middle line:84%
that everything we're
trying to do technologically

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:27.110 align:middle line:84%
is just a crutch for what we
could do naturally if we were

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:28.430 align:middle line:90%
allowed to develop properly.

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: I would say that
that's probably a very close

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.200 align:middle line:84%
to factual statement,
if not factual itself.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.730 align:middle line:84%
We learn over time
how to control

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:40.020 align:middle line:84%
more and more of
our environment,

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:42.860 align:middle line:84%
but very few people focus
on controlling their bodies

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:44.750 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:47.150 align:middle line:84%
During the course of
an average lifespan,

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:49.992 align:middle line:84%
it's been found that you may
have cancer 8, 10, 12 times.

00:44:49.992 --> 00:44:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah,
we've got cells all over--

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:54.365 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: But your body
naturally fights it off.

00:44:54.365 --> 00:44:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes people
go, oh, it's miraculous.

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:57.320 align:middle line:90%
It was a remission.

00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.987 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes, but in most cases,
you never know you had it.

00:44:59.987 --> 00:45:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You didn't
know you had it, yeah.

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: And it's when it
doesn't get cured or when

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.918 align:middle line:84%
it's there when somebody finds
it that it becomes a problem.

00:45:08.918 --> 00:45:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then
you go into fear,

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:13.055 align:middle line:84%
then your blood acidifies,
and then everything starts

00:45:13.055 --> 00:45:14.180 align:middle line:90%
in another kind of pattern.

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:17.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Well, absolutely
how you feel, your attitude,

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:19.400 align:middle line:84%
there's no question about
it, controls how you live.

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:22.480 align:middle line:84%
If somebody is depressed all the
time, they seem to age faster.

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.480 align:middle line:90%
They don't do very well.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:25.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Somebody's
happy all the time,

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:27.120 align:middle line:90%
they seem to do quite well.

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of those
things that they've

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:34.190 align:middle line:84%
looked at medicine,
physician heal thyself.

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:36.590 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times your
attitude, not just your diet

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:40.370 align:middle line:84%
or your use of drugs or whatever
or your amount of exercise,

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:41.660 align:middle line:90%
get out there and live.

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:43.805 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
strongest medicine there is.

00:45:43.805 --> 00:45:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Enjoy your life.

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Absolutely.

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So for
you personally,

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:49.265 align:middle line:84%
what's the next big thing
that you're working on?

00:45:49.265 --> 00:45:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Well--

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I know
you're working on a lot,

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:52.147 align:middle line:90%
but the next big thing.

00:45:52.147 --> 00:45:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: Yes, I've got
a lot of things going on.

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:58.160 align:middle line:84%
I have projects in energy
and in robotics and AI.

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And I don't generally
say a whole lot

00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:05.540 align:middle line:84%
about what I'm working on
because unfortunately, I

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:08.550 align:middle line:84%
tend to get distracted because
of so many interesting things

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:09.350 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, I understand.

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Shults: And I will come back
and look at the thing and go,

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:14.630 align:middle line:84%
oh, I should have fixed
that a couple of months ago.

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But you're
on to something else.

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:16.877 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Guilty.

00:46:16.877 --> 00:46:18.710 align:middle line:84%
But there are so many
things I'm working on.

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:21.350 align:middle line:10%
And right now, big
thing is basically

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:25.460 align:middle line:10%
AI is a big thing, automation
for trying to make life better.

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:26.260 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:27.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Yeah.

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:29.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
thank you for that.

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for this
wonderful discussion.

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:35.540 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really added
a lot of deeper awareness

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:38.930 align:middle line:84%
to not just the information
in terms of what's developing

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:40.488 align:middle line:84%
and available but
to the questions

00:46:40.488 --> 00:46:41.780 align:middle line:90%
we have to be asking ourselves.

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:42.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Absolutely.

00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you've done a
beautiful job articulating.

00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:45.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Shults: Thank you.

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:46.797 align:middle line:84%
It was a real
pleasure being here.

00:46:46.797 --> 00:46:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:49.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure I'll be
seeing you again.

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:52.490 align:middle line:84%
I hope this has been an
incredibly enlightening view

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:54.410 align:middle line:90%
of AI and humanity.

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:57.705 align:middle line:10%
