00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
The field of UFOlogy.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.920 align:middle line:10%
Has become cluttered with
sensation-seekers and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.640 align:middle line:10%
secondhand researchers.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, the public
can't easily tell who is whom.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, I do know some
of the best in the business,

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.670 align:middle line:84%
beginning with
investigative reporter Paola

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Harris, whom I've spoken
with on this show before.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.250 align:middle line:84%
In addition to
researching events,

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.090 align:middle line:84%
Paola has recently become
a party to them as well.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And we'll save that for a
little later in the talk,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.040 align:middle line:84%
but I know it was a
life-changing and shocking

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.430 align:middle line:84%
event, because you're a
very grounded educator.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.430 align:middle line:84%
You go with evidence and
science and-- well, that's

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.332 align:middle line:84%
bound to put you in
harm's way sooner or later

00:01:04.332 --> 00:01:07.230 align:middle line:84%
or in goodness' way, as
it turned out for you.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.370 align:middle line:84%
So, Paola, first of all,
for people who don't already

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.460 align:middle line:84%
know you, I would like
you to just explain

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.350 align:middle line:84%
how you, this wonderfully
grounded academic,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.380 align:middle line:84%
got into this field
and your methodology.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.487 align:middle line:84%
Because I'll tell you, the
field is strewn with charlatans.

00:01:24.487 --> 00:01:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PAOLA HARRIS: Well,
I'm an educator.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.820 align:middle line:10%
I have my master's in education,
multicultural disciplinary

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.890 align:middle line:10%
curriculum.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.260 align:middle line:10%
So my mind is not only
in the humanities.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.770 align:middle line:84%
My mind was to educate,
and it's high school.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And so how I got involved
was in the early days,

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.710 align:middle line:84%
I lived in Colorado,
as you know.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:84%
I was hired in Bloomfield
High School as a high school

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.330 align:middle line:90%
teacher.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was an interesting time,
because "Star Wars" came out.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But an unlikely path
to what you do now. [LAUGHING]

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah,
because they gave me

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.660 align:middle line:90%
a class called Science Fiction.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.530 align:middle line:90%
There was no curriculum for it.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Nobody had written
anything for it.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.100 align:middle line:84%
They said, well,
there's some kids that

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.270 align:middle line:90%
can't be in Shakespeare.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And I was teaching
Shakespeare, too.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.440 align:middle line:84%
But maybe you can like
hook them into education

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.560 align:middle line:90%
by teaching this course.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And the course was Science
Fiction, and I had 18 students.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And after three years,
I had 186 students.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And that caused problems
for the school district,

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.910 align:middle line:84%
because I had the local
minister come in and say, why

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.180 align:middle line:90%
does my niece love your class?

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.810 align:middle line:90%
Let me see your books.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And I brought out HG
Wells, "A Time Machine,"

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle line:90%
"Dune," all the classics.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.330 align:middle line:84%
I said, but there are
classics in science fiction,

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.310 align:middle line:84%
and it's the subject matter
that turns the kids on.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is all
part of my journey.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I think that what happened
was that was in 1979,

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.300 align:middle line:84%
and then "Close Encounters,"
the movie, came out in 1979.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And I want to see it and
had an emotional reaction

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.060 align:middle line:84%
to the end of the
film, the contact part

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.900 align:middle line:84%
were Francois Truffaut has
contact with the beings,

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.930 align:middle line:84%
and he does the tones
plus the hand signals.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.790 align:middle line:90%
How can you forget that?

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.100 align:middle line:90%
That's incredible.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.867 align:middle line:90%
And so I began to think.

00:03:16.867 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, even
though I'm teaching

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.560 align:middle line:84%
this class as science fiction,
is there any fact to this?

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.520 align:middle line:90%
I mean, could this be real?

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And all my life, if
I asked a question,

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.310 align:middle line:84%
the universe
provides the answer.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.900 align:middle line:90%
So I ended up in a wedding.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.300 align:middle line:84%
I went to a wedding
in Evanston, Illinois.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.000 align:middle line:84%
I knew Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who
was a consultant on the film,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.130 align:middle line:84%
had his Center for
UFO Studies up there.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, let me
just go on over there

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.354 align:middle line:84%
and see what's going on
and at what point they are.

00:03:47.354 --> 00:03:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And I never thought he'd ever
be there in a million years.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.110 align:middle line:84%
His secretary found out about
me, that I spoke Italian,

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.660 align:middle line:84%
and I happen to
be standing there,

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.760 align:middle line:84%
and around the corner comes this
very distinguished gentleman

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.210 align:middle line:90%
with white hair, smoking a pipe.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me, and he
said, I hear you speak Italian.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.250 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, would you
be willing to work with me?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And that started
this whole process.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now when was
this, how long ago?

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: 1979.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.200 align:middle line:84%
So when you start with the best
of the best or when you start

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.600 align:middle line:84%
with the teacher or when
you start with a scientist,

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.320 align:middle line:84%
an astronomer who
taught at Northwestern,

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.566 align:middle line:90%
you know it's real.

00:04:29.566 --> 00:04:31.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not a matter
of, do you believe?

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.930 align:middle line:84%
You're working with a scientist,
and he's teaching you things.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.520 align:middle line:84%
And the greatest saying
that Allen Hynek ever

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.050 align:middle line:84%
taught me was to listen
and not make judgments

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.810 align:middle line:90%
until the witnesses were done.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And then, he said, it may
not make sense to you now,

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:84%
he said, but later on all
the dots will be connected.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.270 align:middle line:84%
So I learned a
lot of methodology

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.610 align:middle line:90%
from the greatest of the great.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.490 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.527 align:middle line:84%
And I traveled with him
and his wife and family.

00:05:00.527 --> 00:05:01.610 align:middle line:90%
I used to visit with them.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.500 align:middle line:90%
We'd go on vacation.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.040 align:middle line:90%
We went to Santa Fe together.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very personal
relationship with them.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And when Allen died, it brought
Mimi to Italy, Mimi his wife,

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:90%
to San Marino.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And when I moved
to Italy in 1992,

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.200 align:middle line:84%
I became first a principal of
the American Overseas School

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.090 align:middle line:84%
in Rome, and then
I taught there.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And that paycheck
enabled me to bring over

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.110 align:middle line:84%
all the top UFOlogists
from the United States,

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.120 align:middle line:84%
including people like
Jesse Marcel, Jr.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:38.260 align:middle line:84%
that was the child that picked
up the pieces in the Roswell

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.105 align:middle line:90%
case, and John Mack.

00:05:40.105 --> 00:05:42.577 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know, our
beloved John Mack.

00:05:42.577 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Oh, my goodness,
see, him walking in Florence

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:84%
with me, it began a
personal relationship

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.070 align:middle line:84%
with all the researchers asking
personal questions because they

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.346 align:middle line:84%
would stay at my home,
actually my apartment,

00:06:00.346 --> 00:06:01.470 align:middle line:90%
which was near the Vatican.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.390 align:middle line:84%
So my background
is international,

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.580 align:middle line:84%
but it's also with the best
of the best, the people that

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.380 align:middle line:90%
are involved--

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK, so
one question I've always

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.800 align:middle line:90%
had about this is, why Italy?

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in terms of--
the Italian public

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.949 align:middle line:84%
seem to be much more
open to this phenomena

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:22.990 align:middle line:90%
than the American public.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.940 align:middle line:84%
You're talking early
on, long time ago,

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.940 align:middle line:84%
long time before
the US public even

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.020 align:middle line:84%
engaged with the subject,
probably 10, 15 years before.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, yeah.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.770 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know
our Air Force--

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.350 align:middle line:84%
our Air Force-- the Italian
Air Force was organized

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.600 align:middle line:90%
before the American Air Force.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.680 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know-- I didn't
know a lot of things.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.790 align:middle line:90%
But why Italy?

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are the people
more open minded or what?

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.951 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, first of
all, I ended up in Italy

00:06:46.951 --> 00:06:49.290 align:middle line:84%
because my father
was dying of cancer.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.150 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of
smokers in Europe.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.460 align:middle line:10%
And so I wanted to be near him.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.900 align:middle line:10%
So it was '90, '92, and
I came back in 2007.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.709 align:middle line:10%
But--

00:06:59.709 --> 00:07:02.250 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Was that one of those
"built it and they will come"

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.590 align:middle line:10%
things?

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.548 align:middle line:10%
You were there, so you
started inviting people,

00:07:04.548 --> 00:07:07.320 align:middle line:10%
so you started lighting
up the Italian?

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.700 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: I think so.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.490 align:middle line:10%
But they also knew that
I'd worked with Hynek.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:17.240 align:middle line:10%
And these researchers in Italy,
like Roberto Pinotti-- well,

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.240 align:middle line:10%
he knocked on my door.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.448 align:middle line:10%
He said, you work with Hynek?

00:07:19.448 --> 00:07:20.600 align:middle line:10%
I said yes.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.030 align:middle line:10%
And he said, well, I
want you to work with me.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.210 align:middle line:10%
They put me on TV.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.510 align:middle line:10%
They had me writing.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.800 align:middle line:10%
I still am writing
for "X Times Magazine"

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.190 align:middle line:10%
because what I
really love to do,

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.730 align:middle line:10%
Regina, is just get the
word-for-word interviews

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.380 align:middle line:10%
from the source.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.400 align:middle line:10%
The source is
where people should

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.930 align:middle line:10%
go for the information,
not secondhand, thirdhand,

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.640 align:middle line:10%
internet, all over the place.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's what
most of the people that

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.900 align:middle line:90%
write books on the subject do.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Very few of them actually
go to the source.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, the source
has all the information.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.330 align:middle line:84%
He or she can answer
all the questions.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was lucky
enough-- you might

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.340 align:middle line:90%
think of it as Barbara Walters.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.460 align:middle line:84%
The only difference is Barbara
Walters interviews movie stars,

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and I interview
great personages.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.530 align:middle line:84%
But I have the same
capacity as Barbara Walters.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.594 align:middle line:90%
I ask the right questions.

00:08:07.594 --> 00:08:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Usually the people
that I'm interviewing

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:14.240 align:middle line:90%
have no idea where it's going.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.720 align:middle line:84%
But they're so happy that
I'm very kind to them.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.820 align:middle line:84%
But I ask questions that
no one ever asks them.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.980 align:middle line:84%
For instance, in the
Travis Walton case,

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.850 align:middle line:84%
I asked the question,
why was the craft there

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.080 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.060 align:middle line:84%
What was going on that
they-- it wasn't on vacation.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And so that kind
of question, they

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.970 align:middle line:90%
told me nobody ever asked them.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:36.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:37.280 align:middle line:90%
And you do.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.196 align:middle line:84%
You have a way of getting
to the bottom of it.

00:08:39.196 --> 00:08:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, in our
second conversation,

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.720 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about the
recent Travis Walton event.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.210 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to bring
that up because it's really

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:48.700 align:middle line:84%
kind of a humdinger of a
story that's well documented.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.310 align:middle line:84%
But let's look at some of
the methodology that you use.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And this one, we wrote down
notes about your involvement

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.860 align:middle line:84%
with the European Space
Agency, the life on Mars thing.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.236 align:middle line:90%
What happened there?

00:09:01.236 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: [LAUGHING] Well, at
that particular time in Italy,

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.960 align:middle line:84%
I was doing "Coast
to Coast," and it

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.050 align:middle line:84%
was easier because it
was 8:30 in the morning,

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.450 align:middle line:90%
not midnight like it is now and.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:15.010 align:middle line:84%
I was working with
Richard Hoagland,

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:18.670 align:middle line:84%
who I consider one of the best
researchers on the planet.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.120 align:middle line:90%
He's a very educated person.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And he had heard that
Formisano, this Professor

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Formisano with the
European Space Agency

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:36.040 align:middle line:84%
had a spectrometer that
had measured ammonia

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:40.150 align:middle line:90%
and on Mars and formaldehyde.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you know anything
about ammonia, formaldehyde,

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.620 align:middle line:90%
it dissipates every 72 hours.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.610 align:middle line:84%
So if it's being
given off on Mars,

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.780 align:middle line:90%
whoever is-- that's like urine.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.840 align:middle line:90%


00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Something is alive if it
dissipates every 72 hours.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.380 align:middle line:84%
So he contacted me and, and he
said, let's do a "Coast" show.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.400 align:middle line:84%
He said, but you have
to go to where he is.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And Vittorio Formisano is
at this NASA conference

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.490 align:middle line:90%
on the island of Ischia.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:12.170 align:middle line:90%
Ischia is in the Bay of Naples.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.470 align:middle line:90%
It's near Capri.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.030 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, oh, how
am I going to do this?

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.380 align:middle line:84%
So what I did is register
for the conference.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.670 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know who I was.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:20.550 align:middle line:90%
But I registered.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I took a
hydrofoil, which

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:27.079 align:middle line:84%
is kind of an airplane
that's on water.

00:10:27.079 --> 00:10:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They cruise on an
air cushion across the sea.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:30.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And I ended up
on the island of Ischia.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking at where
the conference was being held,

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:39.972 align:middle line:84%
and I saw Vittorio Formisano
coming out of a jewelry store.

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'm
going to get my story.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And I went running
up to him, and I

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.205 align:middle line:84%
said in Italian,
Professor Formisano,

00:10:47.205 --> 00:10:49.820 align:middle line:84%
I hear that you have said
there's life on Mars,

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.780 align:middle line:84%
and it will be great
for the Italians

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.330 align:middle line:84%
to have that, because they
love bragging about Christopher

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.725 align:middle line:90%
Columbus discovering America.

00:10:56.725 --> 00:10:57.850 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the Italians want--

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is big.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: This is big.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.900 align:middle line:84%
The Italians are going
to discover life on Mars.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.226 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Big bragging point.

00:11:02.226 --> 00:11:03.026 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:11:03.026 --> 00:11:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And he's all
proud, and basically

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.400 align:middle line:84%
what he said to me was,
look, come to the conference,

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.691 align:middle line:90%
and I'll make the announcement.

00:11:08.691 --> 00:11:11.070 align:middle line:84%
But he was with his
wife buying jewelry,

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.030 align:middle line:90%
so it was not a place to do it.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, I'll
be present there.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And I did go to the conference,
and I was sitting in the back.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And what I noticed
was that all the NASA

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:24.840 align:middle line:84%
guys were with white shirts
and ties, no jackets.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.980 align:middle line:90%
They were hanging out.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.700 align:middle line:84%
They were planning
their strategy,

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.520 align:middle line:90%
and they had different speakers.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And Formisano comes
in in a Hawaiian shirt

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.770 align:middle line:84%
with flowers on it and
sits in the very back.

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And just the way that
he was positioned,

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.980 align:middle line:84%
I knew there was trouble,
because he was isolated

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.670 align:middle line:90%
from the rest of the group.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And then it came time for
him to do his lecture,

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:51.480 align:middle line:84%
and he avoided the
subject totally.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, he must have had
someone chat with him prior?

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.834 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He had someone
chat with him prior.

00:11:55.834 --> 00:11:58.590 align:middle line:90%
Because we've talked about this.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:59.970 align:middle line:90%
I think this is staged.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, whatever
announcements about water

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.420 align:middle line:90%
on Mars, life on Mars--

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.336 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, you bet.

00:12:04.336 --> 00:12:07.530 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --or whatever has to
come from the micro-managers

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.270 align:middle line:90%
of the situation.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I'm not saying
NASA-- in that particular case,

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.280 align:middle line:84%
NASA was a micro-manager,
because they

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:21.190 align:middle line:84%
had told him that it
was not the timing

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:22.450 align:middle line:90%
to say something like this.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.180 align:middle line:84%
But it was the European Space
Agency, so I was thinking,

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.244 align:middle line:90%
those poor guys.

00:12:26.244 --> 00:12:27.660 align:middle line:84%
Here they are doing
all this work.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.784 align:middle line:84%
Are they ever going to get
credit for what they do?

00:12:29.784 --> 00:12:33.650 align:middle line:84%
This is a very special
spectrometer he had developed.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but a very
competitive, backbiting field.

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:42.146 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, because look
at what the stakes are here.

00:12:42.146 --> 00:12:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Huge.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: What
country-- I mean, what

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:51.330 align:middle line:84%
if Russia sees life on Mars
or another-- unfortunately,

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to make
a statement here,

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.670 align:middle line:90%
we are the human species.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:55.920 align:middle line:90%
We should be working together.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.190 align:middle line:90%
It should not be countries.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:01.070 align:middle line:84%
We should be working with China,
Russia, all the countries that

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:05.260 align:middle line:84%
have the technology to discover
whatever there is in space.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.890 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately because of the
funding, because of the money,

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.670 align:middle line:84%
because of the politics,
because of everything,

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.790 align:middle line:84%
it ends up being individuals
or countries that

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.090 align:middle line:90%
are taking the credit for this.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:18.423 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what ever
came of that information then?

00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:19.690 align:middle line:90%
Was it completely obscured?

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Or what has since come of it
that there was formaldehyde

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:23.677 align:middle line:90%
and ammonia on Mars?

00:13:23.677 --> 00:13:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, I confronted
him when he came out,

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.160 align:middle line:84%
and he said to me simply
that he needed to have

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.960 align:middle line:90%
his results peer reviewed.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And he said, unless they peer
review my results, and he said,

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:40.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm writing it up for-- he
told me the magazine-- he said,

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.486 align:middle line:90%
I'm not allowed to--

00:13:41.486 --> 00:13:43.735 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we kind of
know where that often goes.

00:13:43.735 --> 00:13:44.800 align:middle line:90%
The bone pile.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.300 align:middle line:84%
He said, I can't
make any statements.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.830 align:middle line:90%
I said, but you promised.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's already out there.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.240 align:middle line:84%
How do you put the genie
back in the bottle?

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.050 align:middle line:90%
It's already out there.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:14:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And he just-- I think,
Regina, it's like Carl Sagan.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.330 align:middle line:90%
And I have to use this example.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.940 align:middle line:84%
I was with Allen
Hynek for many years.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And Allen, I remember, over
coffee once said to me,

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.930 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to Carl Sagan,
and he knows there are UFOs.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Carl Sagan himself even
saw the Blue Book files.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And yet he said, I'll
be damned if I risk my--

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:17.745 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Reputation.

00:14:17.745 --> 00:14:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Grant.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:18.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: The money.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:20.090 align:middle line:90%
It's about the money.

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:20.680 align:middle line:90%
It's about the money.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: About my funds
at Cornell University

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.100 align:middle line:90%
to say there are UFOs.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.970 align:middle line:84%
The timing wasn't
right for Carl then.

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:32.310 align:middle line:84%
The timing is right
for Carl right now.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.650 align:middle line:84%
If he had NOVA, if he
was on NOVA right now,

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.840 align:middle line:84%
he'd be talking
about life on Mars.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.340 align:middle line:90%
I think it's about the timing.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, the point
is you were there.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:43.385 align:middle line:90%
You heard it.

00:14:43.385 --> 00:14:44.190 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even if
it wasn't released,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:45.740 align:middle line:90%
you were there and heard it.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, no, I heard it.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we
have several cases

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.960 align:middle line:84%
that you're very familiar
with that most people aren't

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.700 align:middle line:84%
that familiar with, because
this moves beyond just Roswell,

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:54.500 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.050 align:middle line:84%
So let's dive into
a couple of them.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.926 align:middle line:84%
One of them is a story of
[? Gui ?] [? Andronique. ?]

00:15:00.926 --> 00:15:02.592 align:middle line:84%
[? >>HARRIS: Gui ?]
[? Andronique ?] was

00:15:02.592 --> 00:15:04.555 align:middle line:90%
a geophysicist.

00:15:04.555 --> 00:15:06.570 align:middle line:84%
[? Gui ?] [? Andronique ?]
is a French national,

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:09.190 align:middle line:84%
but he was married
to an Italian.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:10.920 align:middle line:90%
I met him in Rome.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.710 align:middle line:84%
I saw him at a
conference in Rome,

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:15.130 align:middle line:84%
and if course I went to
after him, because what

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:18.710 align:middle line:84%
he said at this conference was
that he was physically present,

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:20.900 align:middle line:84%
here's the source,
firsthand witness,

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.400 align:middle line:84%
on the island of [INAUDIBLE]
in the Bikini Atoll

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:30.470 align:middle line:84%
when the French were doing
800 total H-bomb tests.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just shocking to think
that that was ever allowed--

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.110 align:middle line:90%
800 H-bomb detonations.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:36.540 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: By the
way, we did more.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:37.967 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's shocking--

00:15:37.967 --> 00:15:39.300 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: We Americans did more.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.133 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that we did
that to this planet,

00:15:41.133 --> 00:15:43.600 align:middle line:84%
to the floor of the
sea, ocean life.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.400 align:middle line:90%
Just sickening.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Why do we need 800?

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a couple
would have been OK.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.430 align:middle line:84%
I always ask myself
that question,

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:53.092 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know what
people are thinking.

00:15:53.092 --> 00:15:54.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
they're thinking.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.380 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, he
was on the island,

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and he said-- well, they
were involved in a lawsuit

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:02.400 align:middle line:84%
because the officers
were in bunkers

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.750 align:middle line:84%
but the regular military
men were on the beach.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:10.569 align:middle line:84%
And he had a daughter that
was deformed because of this.

00:16:10.569 --> 00:16:11.610 align:middle line:90%
Their daughter was born--

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There
was a birth defect

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.074 align:middle line:84%
because they were
exposed to the radiation?

00:16:13.074 --> 00:16:14.376 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah,
but she also died.

00:16:14.376 --> 00:16:14.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ah.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:15.610 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:18.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So there was a lawsuit
against [INAUDIBLE], I think.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to interview
him, had him come to my home.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.900 align:middle line:84%
But any time I interview
and every time I do a story,

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.300 align:middle line:84%
I usually-- just think
of me as the "X-Files."

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.645 align:middle line:84%
I have to pull in a Mulder
because I'm either nervous

00:16:31.645 --> 00:16:36.800 align:middle line:84%
or I want to-- I think it's good
to run information by someone

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.190 align:middle line:90%
else who's working with you.

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:41.520 align:middle line:84%
So I asked Antonello Lupino,
who worked for the Customs.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.690 align:middle line:90%
He was a Customs police officer.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And he was with me--
and also a UFOlogist--

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:middle line:84%
and he was with me
during the interview.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And basically what
the story is--

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why were
you nervous doing it?

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
when I film people

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:58.467 align:middle line:84%
and they're whistleblowers,
a whistleblower is--

00:16:58.467 --> 00:17:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, I think this
is going to be revealed

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.560 align:middle line:90%
at the end of this story.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.360 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah. a
whistleblower is--

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:04.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're vulnerable.

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:06.659 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They're
vulnerable, plus they're

00:17:06.659 --> 00:17:07.809 align:middle line:90%
telling state secrets.

00:17:07.809 --> 00:17:08.609 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:09.859 align:middle line:90%
So it can be dangerous.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:11.317 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It can
be very dangerous.

00:17:11.317 --> 00:17:13.474 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, so go ahead.

00:17:13.474 --> 00:17:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: So I wanted
to get him on camera.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.390 align:middle line:90%
So Antonello brought the camera.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:19.280 align:middle line:84%
We set it up in my
living room in Rome

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.660 align:middle line:84%
in the apartment on
the seventh floor.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And as we started, the camera
is rolling, and what he said

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:30.500 align:middle line:84%
was that he was part of a group
of officers-- not officers,

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.720 align:middle line:84%
of military, who were doing the
testing off the Bikini Atoll.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.600 align:middle line:84%
I think it was New
Zealand that stopped all

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.350 align:middle line:84%
that because the
journalists knew about it

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:42.040 align:middle line:90%
and they went after them.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And did this caused the killing
of all the coral, the fish.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:52.560 align:middle line:84%
He said there was three feet of
dead fish on the runway-- three

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.950 align:middle line:90%
feet of dead fish.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Because it was done in the water
not to hurt anybody, but good

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:57.860 align:middle line:90%
grief.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the oceans are alive.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And he said on two
occasions, he personally

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:07.670 align:middle line:84%
saw a flyover of three
UFOs-- on two occasions.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.010 align:middle line:84%
On one occasion, he
jumped in the plane

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:15.850 align:middle line:84%
to go after them with other
people and the plane's

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:18.750 align:middle line:84%
whole navigation
system shut down.

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And they thought they
were going to crash.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.280 align:middle line:84%
When the UFOs went
over the horizon, then

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.430 align:middle line:84%
all the navigation
system came back online.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:30.040 align:middle line:84%
So if they were dangerous--
this is the point

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.960 align:middle line:90%
I want to make to people.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.710 align:middle line:84%
If they were out to
kill us, and they're

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:37.060 align:middle line:84%
watching this craziness, they
would have done something

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:40.120 align:middle line:84%
instead of just present
themselves and say,

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.150 align:middle line:90%
here we are.

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.300 align:middle line:90%
We're watching your insanity.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And this has been documented
in a few different ways, where

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.560 align:middle line:84%
UFOs will show up
when we're detonating

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.660 align:middle line:84%
something or shooting some
missile out into regions

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.460 align:middle line:90%
it shouldn't be in.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:19:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Because there does seem to be
some kind of a larger agenda

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:04.857 align:middle line:84%
or set of rules,
which is planets

00:19:04.857 --> 00:19:05.940 align:middle line:90%
aren't allowed to do that.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.600 align:middle line:84%
You can't just shoot this
toxic stuff out into space.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And you can't pollute
the entire planet

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.600 align:middle line:84%
with it, which they
were doing at the time.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And I remember in
disclosure, I think

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:18.010 align:middle line:84%
one of the witnesses--
it's been a while now--

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:22.580 align:middle line:84%
was talking about how the
US-- was it out of Vandenberg?

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.742 align:middle line:84%
They were shooting a
missile to the moon

00:19:24.742 --> 00:19:27.690 align:middle line:84%
to see if they could detonate
one on the moon for kicks,

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:29.010 align:middle line:90%
see what would happen there.

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And same thing-- a craft came
in at 14,000 miles an hour--

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.560 align:middle line:84%
zz, zz, zz-- from
three directions

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.490 align:middle line:90%
and disabled the missile.

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, that's
Robert Hastings.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.371 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, Robert Hastings.

00:19:39.371 --> 00:19:41.766 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Robert Hastings.

00:19:41.766 --> 00:19:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, these
people that speak out,

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.950 align:middle line:84%
like Robert Salas and Robert
Hastings, to me are heroes.

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are to me, too.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.575 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They're
whistleblowers,

00:19:49.575 --> 00:19:51.680 align:middle line:84%
but it's not easy when
you've been in the military

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.902 align:middle line:90%
to speak out like this.

00:19:52.902 --> 00:19:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the case of
[? Gui ?] [? Andronique ?],

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.670 align:middle line:84%
he explained this, and he also
said that he was curious what

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.430 align:middle line:84%
the UFOs were and
where they came from,

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:90%
the same questions we ask.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.170 align:middle line:84%
So at the end of
the interview, he

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:09.920 align:middle line:84%
wanted to know what was going
on, even though he saw it.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.767 align:middle line:84%
Now, we went for pizza
after that. [LAUGHING]

00:20:12.767 --> 00:20:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.933 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: This is the part
that's like James Bond movie.

00:20:15.933 --> 00:20:17.700 align:middle line:90%
We went for pizza after that.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.750 align:middle line:84%
They went their way,
he and his wife.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And Antonello and I went
back to get our film footage.

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, the door was
open to my apartment.

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And Antonello, who has gut-level
reaction, pulls out his gun.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And he thinks that whoever is
in there is still in there.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'm knocking on the
doors of all my neighbors,

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.630 align:middle line:84%
going, if he shoots somebody,
I want some witnesses.

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Because, I mean,
the door was open.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.760 align:middle line:84%
That's why-- not all the
way, but just a little bit.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.399 align:middle line:90%
And I had a metal door in Rome.

00:20:46.399 --> 00:20:47.940 align:middle line:84%
So I don't even know
how they got in.

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.190 align:middle line:84%
I think they came in
over the balconies,

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.720 align:middle line:84%
and they went out
the front door.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.970 align:middle line:84%
But so he went in,
couldn't find anybody,

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:57.800 align:middle line:90%
but the film footage was gone.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.790 align:middle line:84%
His computer that had
sensitive material was gone.

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:05.860 align:middle line:84%
I had three cameras, two digital
ones, my mother's fur coat,

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.880 align:middle line:90%
my jewelry.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.930 align:middle line:84%
The apartment was made
to look like it was a--

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Traditional robbery.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.971 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Traditional
robbery, because when

00:21:13.971 --> 00:21:17.830 align:middle line:84%
we went to the Carabinieri,
the military place,

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:21.390 align:middle line:84%
we said, they came in
and they robbed it.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:24.164 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, basically
they're just gypsies.

00:21:24.164 --> 00:21:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, well,
they wouldn't need

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:27.590 align:middle line:90%
those videotapes, the gypsies.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:28.415 align:middle line:84%
That wouldn't have
been of interest.

00:21:28.415 --> 00:21:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No, the gypsies--

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The jewelry,
yes, not videotapes.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: No.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:33.680 align:middle line:84%
I know, but I'm not about to
tell the military police what

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.650 align:middle line:90%
we were doing in there.

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:35.450 align:middle line:90%
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:39.860 align:middle line:84%
It's like, I'm not going to
tell them that we were getting--

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.860 align:middle line:84%
and so later on in my life, I
was able to have that on film.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.320 align:middle line:90%
I do have it on film.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And I do have it
on film because I

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:50.110 align:middle line:84%
think it's important
for the future

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:53.530 align:middle line:84%
to be to connect the
dots, to understand

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:57.870 align:middle line:84%
exactly what was happening
and about our visitation.

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:01.410 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I'm hoping
that some year, some university

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.150 align:middle line:84%
will open up some
part of its center

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:07.120 align:middle line:84%
for these firsthand witness
videotapes that I have.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.260 align:middle line:90%
And you have so many.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And I
have a lot of them.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:10.100 align:middle line:90%
There's so many.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You do.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.780 align:middle line:84%
They should be somewhere
vaulted and safe.

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:13.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Exactly.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Because these are the
firsthand witnesses,

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.260 align:middle line:90%
and they won't always be around.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So just
to finish that off,

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:21.180 align:middle line:84%
you house was broken into
after interviewing him.

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And the sense was that
the beings, whoever

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.720 align:middle line:84%
was in the craft that
were doing the flybys,

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.977 align:middle line:84%
were essentially watching and
saying, no, this isn't cool.

00:22:31.977 --> 00:22:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: No, watch
what you're doing.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.518 align:middle line:90%
Look what you're doing.

00:22:34.518 --> 00:22:35.560 align:middle line:90%
What are you thinking?

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And I always say,
what are you thinking?

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good question.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.776 align:middle line:90%
We look like animals at times.

00:22:39.776 --> 00:22:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Apart from
the fact that the Bikini

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Atoll is beautiful-- the
Pacific Rim, it's gorgeous.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.644 align:middle line:90%
It's a part of our planet.

00:22:47.644 --> 00:22:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And we have talked before,
and we'll probably go there,

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:56.040 align:middle line:84%
but the testing that
we doing is going

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.110 align:middle line:84%
to have an effect, whether
there will be a tsunami,

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:01.420 align:middle line:84%
or if you do-- I
believe that fracking

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.490 align:middle line:90%
is going to cause earthquakes.

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:07.249 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you de-balance
or ruin the balance--

00:23:07.249 --> 00:23:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Earth and her flutes.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yes, because
Earth is a living organism.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And the Native Americans tell
us that it's a living organism.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And you're trying to
get materials out of it.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.930 align:middle line:90%
You're destabilizing a balance.

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, and you have
done a video-- we're

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.050 align:middle line:84%
going to get to that
case in a little bit.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.070 align:middle line:84%
But in this video,
I wanted to pull

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:29.890 align:middle line:84%
this one particular
clip at this time

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.690 align:middle line:90%
because it is so heart-rending.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think most
people have seen it.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.570 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we've heard of it.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with
this whole notion

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.990 align:middle line:84%
of having let that genie
out of the bottle, which

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:45.990 align:middle line:90%
is nuclear weaponry.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:84%
In this case, we're
talking about Oppenheimer

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.630 align:middle line:84%
and his comment on
his participation

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:56.940 align:middle line:84%
and what he had given birth to
and its effects on the planet.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And let's take a quick look
at that piece of video now.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.749 align:middle line:90%
It's just stunningly profound.

00:24:03.749 --> 00:24:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>>OPPENHEIMER: We knew the
world would not be the same.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.866 align:middle line:90%


00:24:08.866 --> 00:24:13.142 align:middle line:10%
Few people laughed.

00:24:13.142 --> 00:24:15.476 align:middle line:90%
Few people cried.

00:24:15.476 --> 00:24:16.940 align:middle line:90%
Most people were silent.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.560 align:middle line:90%


00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.720 align:middle line:84%
I remembered the line from the
Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.520 align:middle line:90%
Gita.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.006 align:middle line:90%


00:24:29.006 --> 00:24:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Vishnu was trying to persuade
the prince that he should

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:45.336 align:middle line:84%
do his duty and, to impress him,
takes on his multi-armed form

00:24:45.336 --> 00:24:50.918 align:middle line:84%
and says, now become death,
the destroyer of worlds.

00:24:50.918 --> 00:24:53.890 align:middle line:90%


00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:57.050 align:middle line:84%
I suppose we all thought
that one way or another.

00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is, to me--
it seemed as though he

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.130 align:middle line:90%
was on the edge of tears.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.150 align:middle line:84%
I was when I watched
him and thought,

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:08.124 align:middle line:84%
what must that poor man have
felt about-- now, granted,

00:25:08.124 --> 00:25:09.790 align:middle line:84%
it would have been
someone else in time.

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:13.330 align:middle line:84%
But still, he was instrumental
in unleashing a monster

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:15.609 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:25:15.609 --> 00:25:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's only a
monster because we use it

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.010 align:middle line:90%
in the wrong way.

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:22.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not that this
energy can't be harnessed

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and hasn't been for other
uses but for destruction.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is what concerns other
species that are watching us

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.400 align:middle line:90%
closely all the time.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.640 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: Well, I think
this was the Pandora's

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:39.310 align:middle line:10%
box of this particular planet.

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:42.920 align:middle line:84%
When you open up
Pandora's box, you

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.740 align:middle line:90%
have all kinds of repercussions.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.942 align:middle line:84%
You can't put the genie
back in the bottle.

00:25:47.942 --> 00:25:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not that one.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And I also was very
emotional when I saw this clip.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Thank God Alan [? Ricardas ?]
put it in a video

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:03.570 align:middle line:84%
that I had made about a
case I was working on.

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:07.920 align:middle line:84%
But we have to understand it's
also written at Trinity site.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:12.730 align:middle line:84%
This quote is on a
plaque at Stallion site

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:15.230 align:middle line:90%
in near Soccoro, New Mexico.

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:16.710 align:middle line:90%
It's written.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:21.070 align:middle line:84%
So the scientists that were
working on this, and Einstein

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:24.050 align:middle line:84%
was among them,
Fatemi, Einstein.

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.240 align:middle line:84%
A lot of different
scientists were working

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.870 align:middle line:90%
on the Manhattan Project.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:31.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a double-edged sword.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:34.650 align:middle line:84%
I think you take the
responsibility for what you do.

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And Oppenheimer really took
the responsibility for this.

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:40.210 align:middle line:90%
That was a heavy weight.

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And speaking of Einstein
and going to these men,

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:46.810 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these
physicists were also,

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:49.070 align:middle line:84%
I have learned over
time by knowing

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.390 align:middle line:84%
quite a number of physicists and
also having interviewed them,

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:56.690 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of these men
are prone toward studying

00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:02.230 align:middle line:84%
either classical mysticism
or even modern mysticism,

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:05.960 align:middle line:84%
that they're looking for
answers beyond the physical veil

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.930 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And so that he was quoting
from the Bhagavad Gita

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.390 align:middle line:90%
is not surprising, really.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:16.480 align:middle line:84%
That's not unusual
for that world.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.329 align:middle line:90%
And Einstein, too, was a mystic.

00:27:18.329 --> 00:27:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I really feel good
talking to you about this,

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.310 align:middle line:84%
because wherever Robert
Oppenheimer right now is,

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:26.880 align:middle line:84%
you and I are recognizing
his sensitivity.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And I really thank you for
even showing that clip.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Because I know for
a fact, because I've

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.840 align:middle line:84%
studied the rest of his life,
he was in peace movements.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.710 align:middle line:84%
He had his top-secret
clearance taken away from him.

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:43.910 align:middle line:84%
He was treated very
badly because-- it's not

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:46.660 align:middle line:84%
like he was sorry
for what he did,

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.930 align:middle line:84%
but he realized
the responsibility

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:51.560 align:middle line:84%
of what he did that was
going to have repercussions

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.450 align:middle line:90%
in future generations.

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:56.220 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that you
can go to Trinity site

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:59.500 align:middle line:90%
now and see that quote.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:00.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's amazing.

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's very powerful
listening to it from him.

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:04.230 align:middle line:84%
I want to go to
Einstein for a moment.

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:06.130 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a place I was going
to go in the conversation,

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:08.690 align:middle line:84%
but when I saw you at a
conference a few months ago,

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:10.890 align:middle line:90%
you passed this paper on to me.

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that
paper, because people

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:17.430 align:middle line:84%
wonder about the great
academics and their position

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:20.290 align:middle line:84%
on the notion of life
elsewhere and interfaced

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:22.600 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrial
civilizations.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, the
paper that I passed on

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:29.000 align:middle line:84%
to you was an MJ-12 document
that comes from Ryan Wood's

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.580 align:middle line:90%
website on the MJ-12 documents.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.200 align:middle line:90%
Majestic is MJ-12.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And they are documents
that have been declassified

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.390 align:middle line:90%
and are on Ryan's site.

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:42.550 align:middle line:84%
But this particular
one it was signed

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:45.960 align:middle line:84%
by Einstein and Oppenheimer,
so you know they talked.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's called "Relationships
with Celestrial"--

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:53.930 align:middle line:84%
"Celestrial," not "Celestial"--
"Celestrial Bodies."

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And it basically
is five pages long,

00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:58.800 align:middle line:90%
and it's to President Truman.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And it said, in essence-- it's
got many, many paragraphs.

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:07.450 align:middle line:84%
It says, well, when
we exploded the bomb,

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:11.780 align:middle line:84%
we found out that a cosmic
culture is visiting us,

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and we have to deal with it on
an exopolitical level, which

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:18.150 align:middle line:84%
means, what do we do
with these people that

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:19.300 align:middle line:90%
are visiting us now?

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Do we get the United Nations
involved with these cultures?

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Should we give them some
land on this planet?

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Do we prepare to
fight against them?

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:35.060 align:middle line:84%
These are all issues that I
call exopolitics because they're

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.350 align:middle line:90%
protocols for future contact.

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And this document, the
important part about it

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:42.260 align:middle line:84%
is I saw the word
"extraterrestrial biological

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.550 align:middle line:84%
entity," which Colonel
Corso used a lot,

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:45.634 align:middle line:90%
and it was before Roswell.

00:29:45.634 --> 00:29:46.433 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:46.433 --> 00:29:47.410 align:middle line:90%
EBE before Roswell.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, before Roswell.

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.860 align:middle line:84%
So what in the world did they
see before Roswell happened?

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Did they see the body of
one that they've already

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:55.980 align:middle line:90%
labeled it?

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
call it a person.

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:01.703 align:middle line:84%
They called it an
extraterrestrial biological

00:30:01.703 --> 00:30:02.503 align:middle line:90%
entity.

00:30:02.503 --> 00:30:03.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Known as EBEs.

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Which is like a clone.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: So like a clone.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Question quickly-- did
Truman ever receive that letter

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:08.960 align:middle line:90%
and read it?

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It was completely
censored by Bandar Bush.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.470 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
document, it says,

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:18.150 align:middle line:84%
Note President Truman
need not see this.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And anybody that wants
to look at that document,

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:22.480 align:middle line:84%
go to Ryan Wood's
site and see it.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.350 align:middle line:90%
It's five pages.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And I cite it as an
incident before Roswell.

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
really critical.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Another thing in that
letter, as I recall,

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:37.380 align:middle line:84%
there was a sentence or two
saying something to the effect

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:41.520 align:middle line:84%
that if we do not prove
worthy of conducting ourselves

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.530 align:middle line:84%
in a proper manner,
maybe we should

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:45.942 align:middle line:90%
allow them to do that for us.

00:30:45.942 --> 00:30:47.400 align:middle line:84%
They were talking
about giving them

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.682 align:middle line:84%
some-- extraterrestrial
biological entities, whomever,

00:30:51.682 --> 00:30:55.040 align:middle line:84%
"celestial" forces, some
control on this planet,

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.240 align:middle line:84%
because they must have
questioned whether or not

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.790 align:middle line:84%
we were handling our affairs
properly to have written

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:00.790 align:middle line:90%
such a bold statement.

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:01.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:04.173 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that I notice,
because I'm an English teacher,

00:31:04.173 --> 00:31:06.830 align:middle line:84%
is they use the word cosmic
cultures, which means--

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:08.360 align:middle line:90%
and there was a whole paragraph.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.796 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they have culture.

00:31:09.796 --> 00:31:11.170 align:middle line:84%
What's the definition
of culture?

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Art, philosophy, theology.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.910 align:middle line:84%
When you think of-- some
of the primitive cultures

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:22.190 align:middle line:84%
don't have any culture or they
have a very primitive culture,

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:23.900 align:middle line:84%
but we're so
sophisticated we have

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:27.320 align:middle line:84%
all of those things, the art,
the sculpture, the media,

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.120 align:middle line:90%
the whole thing.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And so Einstein and Oppenheimer
assumed that whoever

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:33.730 align:middle line:90%
is visiting us were people.

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise they
wouldn't have culture.

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:36.770 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:37.570 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't random.

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:39.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I want to go into
a couple of cases,

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.875 align:middle line:84%
because they'll take a
little while to share.

00:31:42.875 --> 00:31:45.790 align:middle line:84%
One of them is Charles
Hall, the weatherman

00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:48.080 align:middle line:84%
who met some of these
beings that we have

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.180 align:middle line:90%
labeled as the Tall Whites.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.220 align:middle line:90%
Tell us the story.

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well, when I was in
Roswell at the Roswell meetings

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:59.680 align:middle line:84%
at the famous Roswell-- in
July they have conferences.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.120 align:middle line:84%
I saw this gentleman
selling a book called

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.990 align:middle line:90%
"Millennium Hospitality."

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And it dealt with his
being a weatherman

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:10.530 align:middle line:84%
at the Indian Springs
facility of Area 51 and his

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:13.470 align:middle line:84%
not being prepared but
meeting Tall Whites.

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:18.780 align:middle line:84%
By the way, UFO mythology is
calling everybody Tall Whites.

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:20.820 align:middle line:90%
These people were people.

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:23.760 align:middle line:90%
They were not 10 feet tall.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.040 align:middle line:84%
They were just six
foot tall and very thin

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:32.530 align:middle line:84%
with-- Charles would describe
their hair as almost platinum

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.090 align:middle line:84%
blonde transparent, he said,
as if they were coming out

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:36.650 align:middle line:90%
of chemotherapy.

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:39.910 align:middle line:90%
And very almond-shaped eyes.

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:42.980 align:middle line:84%
He said they look like
Twiggy, the model Twiggy

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.550 align:middle line:90%
of the early '50s and '60s.

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And he said what happened to him
was that he took a logic test,

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:54.410 align:middle line:84%
a test to-- he thought he
was going into intelligence,

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:55.250 align:middle line:90%
and so he--

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is the
weatherman Charles Hall.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.401 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: The weatherman.

00:32:57.401 --> 00:33:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And he basically thought he'd
be working in the intelligence

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:05.250 align:middle line:84%
agency because he got a 99%
for rationality on this test.

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:07.949 align:middle line:84%
And so what they did do--
and he wasn't prepared for it

00:33:07.949 --> 00:33:10.490 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't tell them--
is they made him a weatherman

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:13.360 align:middle line:84%
and put him out on this
facility in the desert.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.500 align:middle line:84%
So one day he's walking
around in the desert,

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and in the sagebrush,
there looks

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:21.310 align:middle line:90%
like somebody who's stuck.

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:22.729 align:middle line:90%
And it's a little girl.

00:33:22.729 --> 00:33:24.520 align:middle line:84%
He walks up to her,
and it's a little girl.

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And he looks at her very clearly
and sees almond-shaped eyes.

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And he knows she's not
human, and he's freaked out.

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And he's basically saying,
where's your mom, little girl?

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And he backs out
slowly, looks up,

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:40.180 align:middle line:84%
and there's the mom
and the guards that

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:43.420 align:middle line:90%
are another race of people.

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And he helps by making
a path, the little girl,

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:50.520 align:middle line:84%
because he makes a path with
his feet so she can come out.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.620 align:middle line:84%
She's gotten caught
in the sagebrush.

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.620 align:middle line:84%
So he said from that moment
on, he forged a relationship

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:56.950 align:middle line:90%
with these people.

00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And he's telling this,
and I'm looking at him,

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.310 align:middle line:90%
and I know that he's not lying.

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:03.870 align:middle line:90%
Because he's remembering.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:05.860 align:middle line:90%
He's not creating.

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And I as a journalist, because
I've talked to so many people,

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:11.281 align:middle line:84%
I know the difference
between making up something.

00:34:11.281 --> 00:34:13.739 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, it's like when
psychologists watch children

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:14.929 align:middle line:10%
render stories.

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:16.770 align:middle line:10%
If it's just very flat
and matter of fact,

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:18.269 align:middle line:10%
they know they're
telling the truth.

00:34:18.269 --> 00:34:21.050 align:middle line:84%
There's a more lilting
and questioning quality

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:22.780 align:middle line:90%
when we're making stuff up.

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.120 align:middle line:90%
Plus, he had all the details.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I began questioning
him like crazy about this.

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:30.620 align:middle line:84%
I said, what did they look like,
what happened, and so forth?

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And he was able to answer
right off the top of his head.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And knowing him for two years
before I released the story,

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.710 align:middle line:84%
he never changed one
word of the story.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:40.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So these were
physical, third-dimensional

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:40.500 align:middle line:90%
entities.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.791 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, they were people.

00:34:41.791 --> 00:34:45.909 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And did they did they
wear clothing, for example?

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:47.020 align:middle line:90%
Did he ever say?

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.364 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:34:48.364 --> 00:34:49.489 align:middle line:90%
They wore regular clothing.

00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:51.447 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning when he
was dealing with them,

00:34:51.447 --> 00:34:55.800 align:middle line:84%
they would wear a helmet that
had a kind of contraption

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.210 align:middle line:84%
on it, where he'd have to
hold his head a certain way,

00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:02.520 align:middle line:84%
and they would beam
thought into his head.

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.355 align:middle line:90%
Their mouths weren't moving.

00:35:04.355 --> 00:35:07.630 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if they wanted
him to move, they'd say,

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:09.130 align:middle line:90%
Charles, move to the left.

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:10.850 align:middle line:84%
We're coming through
or something.

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:12.480 align:middle line:84%
He said later on
in his life, they

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.630 align:middle line:84%
were able to use their
mouth to actually speak

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:16.540 align:middle line:90%
the words in English.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:19.080 align:middle line:84%
I've always wondered about
that, what language they speak.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to adapt
themselves to communication

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:23.110 align:middle line:90%
with Charles.

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Charles,
I'm fascinated,

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:26.652 align:middle line:84%
number one, because
of the protocols,

00:35:26.652 --> 00:35:28.360 align:middle line:84%
because I've always
wondered what are you

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.950 align:middle line:84%
supposed to do when
you meet somebody,

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:32.450 align:middle line:84%
and number two, the fact that
they had their kids with them.

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And he said there
was some 300 of them.

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.820 align:middle line:84%
He said there was in the
mountain the mothership, which

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:39.640 align:middle line:84%
was hidden or cloaked
in the mountain.

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.723 align:middle line:10%
Because it would come in--

00:35:40.723 --> 00:35:41.920 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Near Area 51?

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.720 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: It's southern
part of Area 51.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:48.420 align:middle line:10%
It's called Indian Springs
near Dog Bone Lake.

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And I did this story with
a Frontier Airlines pilot

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:55.020 align:middle line:84%
because I was freaking out,
too, at the time and said,

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:55.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm going nuts.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:56.880 align:middle line:90%
Is this real?

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And so the Frontier Airlines
pilot that did it with me

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:03.270 align:middle line:84%
was verifying a lot
of these things.

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:08.110 align:middle line:84%
He even flew close to this area
and was able to photograph it.

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And we knew that all
of this was real.

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And because it
happened in 1965, he

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:17.740 align:middle line:90%
was able to tell me about it.

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:19.965 align:middle line:84%
What happened is,
if it was today,

00:36:19.965 --> 00:36:21.340 align:middle line:84%
he couldn't have
told me about it

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:23.380 align:middle line:84%
because everybody went
camping up there after I

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:24.640 align:middle line:90%
released the story.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.870 align:middle line:84%
They're all waiting to
see the Tall Whites.

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:28.572 align:middle line:84%
Well, logically they
wouldn't be there.

00:36:28.572 --> 00:36:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise he wouldn't be
able to talk about it.

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:34.690 align:middle line:84%
He's military, working
still at Kirkland Air Force

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Base, high security clearance.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.450 align:middle line:84%
He isn't somebody
off the streets.

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Charles?

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And so he was a
military meteorologist.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.170 align:middle line:84%
Not a weatherman on the
news, just to clarify that.

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:42.660 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: He was Air Force.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, Air Force.

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:44.904 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And from there,
he went to Vietnam.

00:36:44.904 --> 00:36:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking in 1965,
one year on that base,

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:49.440 align:middle line:90%
that he went to Vietnam.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I want to get
back to the Tall Whites.

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:52.680 align:middle line:84%
I know I asked you if
they wore clothing,

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:53.824 align:middle line:90%
and you can't explain that.

00:36:53.824 --> 00:36:55.990 align:middle line:84%
But I have a lot of other
questions about them, too,

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:57.500 align:middle line:90%
and what they told him.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:00.350 align:middle line:84%
I want to know where
they were from,

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:02.750 align:middle line:84%
why they were there,
what kind of message

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:07.340 align:middle line:84%
or what kind of observation was
going on of the human species,

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:08.140 align:middle line:90%
all of it.

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:11.041 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with
that clothing again.

00:37:11.041 --> 00:37:12.540 align:middle line:84%
What kind of clothing
did they wear?

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:13.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
he's got five books.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.146 align:middle line:84%
They're called
"Millennium Hospitality."

00:37:15.146 --> 00:37:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And they're filled with detail,
the kind of detail I want.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.930 align:middle line:84%
So like I said, what
about the children?

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And he talked about
two boys and a girl

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.380 align:middle line:84%
that the teacher or the
mother of that child that

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:30.320 align:middle line:84%
was stuck in the sagebrush
would bring around

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.850 align:middle line:84%
to watch him release
these colored balloons.

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:35.040 align:middle line:84%
I guess they didn't have
very much to do there.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And they would watch him
also paint by numbers.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:41.160 align:middle line:84%
But he told me that in 1965,
there wasn't much he could do.

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.610 align:middle line:84%
He'd look at the Sears
Roebuck catalog for fun.

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And he noticed that the
children were wearing clothes

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.936 align:middle line:90%
and overalls from that catalog.

00:37:48.936 --> 00:37:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHING]

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:52.186 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And he said the
trucks would come into the base.

00:37:52.186 --> 00:37:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sears needs to do this
as an ad campaign. [LAUGHING]

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.696 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And he said
the trucks would come in

00:37:56.696 --> 00:37:57.680 align:middle line:90%
with these clothes.

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And he also in his books
talks about the women

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:04.700 align:middle line:84%
didn't like the clothes they
were given by the generals.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:10.500 align:middle line:84%
So since this area is near
Las Vegas, Charles on his R&R

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.060 align:middle line:84%
would go into clothing stores,
women's clothing stores,

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:16.750 align:middle line:84%
and suggest that some
people were coming in.

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And these Tall Whites had--
they're not that tall.

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Size 00.

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Basically
would look around

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:27.630 align:middle line:84%
with white nylons
and nurse's outfits

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:30.090 align:middle line:84%
because their skin
was milk white

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and would wear dark
glasses and wigs.

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:35.550 align:middle line:84%
So he said that he
would see them walking

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:38.410 align:middle line:90%
in Vegas with CIA handlers.

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:41.057 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how did you
know the difference?

00:38:41.057 --> 00:38:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, they
have a way, he said.

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Their joints, when
they walk, they

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.460 align:middle line:84%
would glide instead
of actually walk.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.380 align:middle line:84%
He said their joints
are not made like ours.

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:52.102 align:middle line:84%
So he'd see them like
gliding down the street.

00:38:52.102 --> 00:38:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said, did they go
into the women's stores

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:55.380 align:middle line:90%
and buy get the clothes?

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:56.500 align:middle line:90%
And he said yes.

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.962 align:middle line:84%
He said, because I went ahead
and kind of forged the way

00:38:58.962 --> 00:39:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and said these people
were going to come.

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And I might have said,
but what we're doing

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:08.484 align:middle line:84%
is we're treating them like
human beings, like we treat us.

00:39:08.484 --> 00:39:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is the part
that interested me,

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:13.280 align:middle line:84%
because in the end,
I really want to know

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.489 align:middle line:90%
what these cultures are like.

00:39:14.489 --> 00:39:15.288 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:15.288 --> 00:39:16.180 align:middle line:90%
Where were they from?

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:17.670 align:middle line:90%
And why were they here at all?

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I asked
Charles about that.

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:22.796 align:middle line:84%
And said, when I asked the
teacher where they were from,

00:39:22.796 --> 00:39:24.670 align:middle line:84%
her answer was, what
difference does it make?

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't call our
planets the same as yours.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And Charles surmised-- she
turned around and pointed.

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:35.110 align:middle line:84%
He thinks they come from
close to Barnard Star.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And he said maybe
close to Arcturus.

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:40.520 align:middle line:90%
So they could be Arcturians.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:43.880 align:middle line:84%
But I personally have learned
not to label these people.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:44.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:45.890 align:middle line:90%
I was still curious.

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And what about the nature
of their transmissions

00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:53.054 align:middle line:84%
to him and their
intelligence and personality?

00:39:53.054 --> 00:39:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
what I got-- and I

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:58.560 align:middle line:84%
think this is probably the
case with any of the ETs

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:02.040 align:middle line:84%
that live among us-- they're
curious about our life.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And if they look like us at all,
they can mix in very easily,

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and you can't notice
they're there.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:11.520 align:middle line:84%
So what they asked
him was-- there's

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.390 align:middle line:84%
a lot of stories in
there, individual stories.

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:17.180 align:middle line:84%
He talked about the
alien doctor watching him

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:18.530 align:middle line:90%
write a letter to his father.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And the alien doctor--
the ET doctor--

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:23.300 align:middle line:84%
was not allowed
to take anything.

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.799 align:middle line:84%
I think there's some protocols,
like you can't take anything

00:40:25.799 --> 00:40:27.580 align:middle line:90%
away from Charles's shack.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:30.590 align:middle line:84%
But Charles felt bad for
him, so he copied the letter

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:34.620 align:middle line:84%
with the old-fashioned
carbons that we used to have.

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And then he threw the
carbon in the trash.

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And he said the next
day it was gone.

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Because, I mean, in
essence, that alien doctor

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:43.490 align:middle line:84%
wanted to know the
relationship between mother

00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:46.004 align:middle line:90%
and child or father and son.

00:40:46.004 --> 00:40:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
he was looking at.

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:51.455 align:middle line:84%
It's like in the end, they
could be cosmic anthropologists.

00:40:51.455 --> 00:40:52.330 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:54.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that
makes total sense.

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: They're
wondering how we do it

00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and how our relationships
and what theirs were.

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:01.820 align:middle line:84%
From what I understand
from those books,

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:06.270 align:middle line:84%
theirs are very, very
rational-- very, very rational.

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:08.030 align:middle line:84%
However, there is
a story in there

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:11.620 align:middle line:84%
about a weatherman
that was there

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:13.700 align:middle line:84%
before Charles who
was very freaked out

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:17.800 align:middle line:84%
when he saw one of the
little boys, took a crowbar,

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:21.730 align:middle line:84%
threw it at the little ET
boy, and broke his arm.

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And the problem was
that these people,

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:27.720 align:middle line:84%
as advanced as they are, they
don't heal very fast when

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:30.150 align:middle line:90%
it comes to bones.

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:33.240 align:middle line:84%
The older they get, Charles
said, the more fragile

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.990 align:middle line:84%
their body becomes,
the bone structure.

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And they almost killed,
this weatherman.

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:41.730 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to find him.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And with the pilot, we were
able to find four people that

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:46.700 align:middle line:90%
worked with Charles.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.930 align:middle line:90%
But after 40 years, it was hard.

00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:52.380 align:middle line:84%
We had the help
of a Los Angeles--

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.790 align:middle line:90%
retired LAPD policeman.

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:58.850 align:middle line:84%
So the way I work is a
forensics kind of thing

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:00.470 align:middle line:84%
or a research kind
of thing, the way

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:02.046 align:middle line:90%
you would if you were like--

00:42:02.046 --> 00:42:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA:
Investigating any case.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah,
any kind of case.

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:06.325 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, well,
then that obviously

00:42:06.325 --> 00:42:10.280 align:middle line:90%
brings us to the 1945 case.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Because I watched
your video on that.

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the interviews
that were conducted

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:18.540 align:middle line:84%
with-- thank God
a couple of them

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:21.660 align:middle line:84%
are still alive today
from that event.

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And if you would
introduce us to Jose.

00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:27.477 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Jose
Padilla and Reme Baca.

00:42:27.477 --> 00:42:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was in Italy when
I read about this story.

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:32.430 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering why my
colleagues weren't covering it.

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:35.681 align:middle line:84%
But I realized that Roswell
is the big case and forget it.

00:42:35.681 --> 00:42:37.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but this
predates Roswell, once again.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: This was 1945, one
month after the atomic bomb was

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:43.840 align:middle line:90%
exploded.

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And two little
Mexican boys, who were

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:52.990 align:middle line:84%
about 13 miles from the Trinity
site where the bomb exploded,

00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:56.500 align:middle line:84%
were on the land
of one of the boys.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Jose Padilla's father had
leased land from the BLM.

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And those two boys
were told to go look

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:05.620 align:middle line:84%
for a cow that was calving,
an exotic kind of cow

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:10.250 align:middle line:84%
that they had, these
different breeds from-- I

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:12.000 align:middle line:90%
think he said it was from Spain.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And while they were doing
this, since they were privy

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:20.551 align:middle line:84%
to the bomb explosion, it
was raining and thunder

00:43:20.551 --> 00:43:22.550 align:middle line:84%
and lightning, and they
heard another explosion.

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh, dear, one
month later another explosion.

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And what they were
looking at-- and they

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.750 align:middle line:84%
looked from over the
hill with binocluars--

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:34.160 align:middle line:84%
was a craft that came in,
took out a radio tower,

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:41.120 align:middle line:84%
made an L shape, and
landed there on a tilt.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And the two little
boys, being curious,

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:45.200 align:middle line:84%
went down very
close to the craft--

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:49.270 align:middle line:84%
I think it was some 500
feet from the craft--

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:52.210 align:middle line:84%
and with binoculars saw that a
piece was broken off and there

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:56.460 align:middle line:84%
were three beings
with long arms,

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:58.970 align:middle line:84%
he calls it sashaying
front and back, but--

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:00.599 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They were disoriented.

00:44:00.599 --> 00:44:02.140 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like they
were disoriented.

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:04.356 align:middle line:84%
He and Reme were very
matter of fact about this.

00:44:04.356 --> 00:44:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Again, you can tell they're not
obviously making up this story.

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.060 align:middle line:90%
They remember everything.

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: They remember.

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:11.140 align:middle line:90%
And Reme was six.

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:12.210 align:middle line:90%
He never forgot it.

00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:14.800 align:middle line:90%
And Jose was nine.

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And I questioned Jose about
his being nine, and he said,

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:20.370 align:middle line:84%
but I was driving the
truck at that time,

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and I was actually
delivering hamburger

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:23.890 align:middle line:90%
to the Owl Bar and Cafe.

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And I was riding a horse
before I could walk.

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And I still had diapers on
when I was riding a horse.

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:29.470 align:middle line:90%
They were other times.

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:30.787 align:middle line:90%
1945 were other times.

00:44:30.787 --> 00:44:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Other times, where a
little kid could drive the car,

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:35.660 align:middle line:84%
and you trusted them to
do things and chores.

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:36.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:41.235 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And they were much
more mature and had to help.

00:44:41.235 --> 00:44:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And they had to help their
parents because their parents

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:46.170 align:middle line:90%
were farmers and so forth.

00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:51.300 align:middle line:84%
What was interesting about
that was that it was one month

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:53.730 align:middle line:90%
after the bomb exploded.

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:54.530 align:middle line:90%
And it was--

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nearby.

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Really,
13 miles from there.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And the Owl Bar and Cafe
were Oppenheimer-- and Jose

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.290 align:middle line:84%
remembers Oppenheimer
walking around in there.

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:07.040 align:middle line:84%
In fact, nobody knew
they were scientists.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.120 align:middle line:84%
They thought they were
salesmen because they

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.630 align:middle line:90%
carried briefcases.

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:13.234 align:middle line:84%
And they told everybody
they were prospectors.

00:45:13.234 --> 00:45:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: This is top secret.

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.870 align:middle line:84%
So the Owl Bar Cafe was
the only watering hole.

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:19.990 align:middle line:84%
It was the only place
you could buy groceries.

00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:23.585 align:middle line:84%
And then also, that's
where the girls were.

00:45:23.585 --> 00:45:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's very important
that we say that,

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:29.220 align:middle line:84%
because the clip has that's
where the girls were,

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:30.712 align:middle line:90%
because that's why the--

00:45:30.712 --> 00:45:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's why
the boys were there.

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: That's why the-- the
guys that were cleaning up,

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.854 align:middle line:84%
the seven guys, young guys
who were part of the Manhattan

00:45:36.854 --> 00:45:41.750 align:middle line:84%
Project, went and left
the craft unattended.

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:42.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:46.160 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about what happened.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Jose said they had
to go home and sleep,

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:51.540 align:middle line:84%
and they went back the next
day and things had changed.

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And now the military starts
making their entrance

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:54.906 align:middle line:90%
into the story.

00:45:54.906 --> 00:45:55.780 align:middle line:90%
Explain what happens.

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:58.196 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, they went home
and told Jose's father, who

00:45:58.196 --> 00:46:03.520 align:middle line:84%
got Sheriff Apodaca involved,
and the military went there.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And it took eight days
to do this recovery.

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And they had to build a road
to go down and get this craft.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And they asked permission
of Jose's father

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:14.200 align:middle line:90%
to cut the cattle guard.

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Because they were taking
out a weather balloon.

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, another
weather balloon--

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: --the gate,
the barbed wire out here,

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.010 align:middle line:84%
the cattle guard, because
the barbed wire was

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:27.540 align:middle line:84%
only eight feet long,
and this weather balloon

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:31.214 align:middle line:90%
was like 30 feet wide.

00:46:31.214 --> 00:46:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't get
the weather balloon out.

00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And what Jose said, which was
really interesting, he said,

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:39.180 align:middle line:84%
my father and I picked up
weather balloons all the time.

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.270 align:middle line:90%
It's just like Marcel.

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:42.992 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to Jesse
Marcel, Jr. He goes,

00:46:42.992 --> 00:46:45.060 align:middle line:84%
we knew what weather
balloons looked like.

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: He said, we
picked them up all the time.

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:51.220 align:middle line:90%
It was done constantly.

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.720 align:middle line:84%
So the military
did cut the gate,

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:55.740 align:middle line:90%
put in a heavy metal gate.

00:46:55.740 --> 00:47:00.580 align:middle line:84%
And the boys being boys
were watching the recovery.

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And they watched
for many, many days.

00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:04.450 align:middle line:90%
And the thing is--

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:06.034 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Unbeknownst
to the military?

00:47:06.034 --> 00:47:06.833 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:47:06.833 --> 00:47:07.760 align:middle line:90%
They were hiding.

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.550 align:middle line:84%
They were like
hiding on the hill.

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:15.190 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the film footage
was done by James Fox,

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:16.350 align:middle line:90%
the great filmmaker.

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And he went down with me
to do parts of this film,

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:25.500 align:middle line:84%
because I said, James, unless we
get down there, nobody on Earth

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:26.980 align:middle line:90%
will ever know what happened.

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.650 align:middle line:84%
So can you just--
and he was wonderful.

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:32.030 align:middle line:84%
He came, he filmed, and
he handed me the film.

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And we went to the places
where the boys stood.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:37.089 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we actually relived
that whole situation.

00:47:37.089 --> 00:47:38.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
let's talk about what

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:39.890 align:middle line:90%
happened to them after that.

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:44.130 align:middle line:84%
So now we've kind of
chronicled what happened

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:46.680 align:middle line:84%
and that they had seen
these little beings.

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And now that the military
has involved themselves,

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:53.020 align:middle line:84%
they did ultimately come
and speak with the families.

00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yes.

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:57.820 align:middle line:84%
They came and spoke to the boys
because of what the boys did.

00:47:57.820 --> 00:47:59.970 align:middle line:84%
But you had mentioned
before, Regina, about

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:02.780 align:middle line:90%
the mental communication.

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:04.455 align:middle line:90%
And when--

00:48:04.455 --> 00:48:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The telepathic
communication.

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, because
when it first happened,

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:14.080 align:middle line:84%
these little beings made a
high-pitched, screechy noise

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.930 align:middle line:84%
that was like a baby crying,
I think Jose described it.

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:20.474 align:middle line:84%
And he was positive
they were hurt.

00:48:20.474 --> 00:48:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And he was going to
go in and help them.

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:23.098 align:middle line:90%
He said, they're heart.

00:48:23.098 --> 00:48:24.266 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:48:24.266 --> 00:48:25.640 align:middle line:84%
He was very
concerned about them.

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, he said, we
gotta go in and help him.

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't know
what they were.

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:30.173 align:middle line:84%
He thought they were
children because it was

00:48:30.173 --> 00:48:33.460 align:middle line:90%
the same size as Reme and him.

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:35.230 align:middle line:90%
And Reme started to cry.

00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And he said there was smoke
and the mesquite was burning.

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:40.050 align:middle line:90%
And so he let it go.

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:42.510 align:middle line:84%
But then Reme later
on when I interviewed

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:47.300 align:middle line:84%
him said that he got visions of
catastrophes, of people falling

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:50.400 align:middle line:84%
out of buildings-- and they
had never seen skyscrapers--

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:55.170 align:middle line:84%
and of catastrophes and
just really heart wrenching.

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:56.462 align:middle line:90%
But I was thinking about this--

00:48:56.462 --> 00:48:57.669 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Telepathic imagery.

00:48:57.669 --> 00:48:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Yeah.

00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe what they got also is what
the consequence of that bomb

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.992 align:middle line:90%
was going to cause.

00:49:04.992 --> 00:49:05.970 align:middle line:90%
Is that possible?

00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Maybe so.

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Because when it did
hit Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:15.900 align:middle line:84%
the visions that Reme
had would correlate

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:18.460 align:middle line:90%
to what we had discovered.

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It did
inspire a lot of events

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:23.450 align:middle line:84%
that have certainly come
to plague the planet

00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:23.950 align:middle line:90%
at this period in time.

00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:24.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Oh, yeah.

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:26.580 align:middle line:84%
It could have been 9/11
because of the sky scrapers.

00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
what I was thinking.

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:29.396 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: It could
have been all of it.

00:49:29.396 --> 00:49:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
especially people

00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:34.000 align:middle line:84%
falling from buildings-- having
done that interview with one

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.950 align:middle line:84%
of my favorite
people, Dr. Judy Wood,

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:39.960 align:middle line:84%
talking about the nature of
the explosion and the heating

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:41.460 align:middle line:84%
from the inside,
because it appeared

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:46.960 align:middle line:84%
to be more of a nuclear fission
type of event that occurred,

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.870 align:middle line:90%
not an explosion.

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, it could have
even been future pacing.

00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:53.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as these things
are set in motion,

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:56.867 align:middle line:84%
future probabilities and
timelines are already laid out.

00:49:56.867 --> 00:49:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Yeah, but
these people are--

00:49:58.450 --> 00:49:59.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They didn't
know any of this.

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:00.260 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:00.670 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: I get that they
could be time travelers, too.

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:03.660 align:middle line:90%
You could throw that in there.

00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's true.

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:05.480 align:middle line:10%
That is definitely
a possibility.

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:06.790 align:middle line:10%
>>HARRIS: They could
be time travelers,

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:08.670 align:middle line:10%
and they know what the
future is going to hold,

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:09.540 align:middle line:10%
and they're watching.

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If we go on a
certain trajectory, which

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.580 align:middle line:90%
we had already committed to.

00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:13.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Right.

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:14.720 align:middle line:90%
OK, and that's key.

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, one other thing
before-- oh, we're

00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:19.850 align:middle line:84%
going to wrap it up
in a minute here.

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:21.700 align:middle line:84%
In that crater, as I
was watching the video,

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:24.800 align:middle line:84%
I noticed the plants in that
crater look quite different.

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.855 align:middle line:84%
It's much more verdant
in that little ball.

00:50:27.855 --> 00:50:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Well,
we had a problem.

00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:32.690 align:middle line:84%
I've been going back there
for the last three years.

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is that it's
been like a little desert.

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:36.450 align:middle line:90%
It was a circle.

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:38.380 align:middle line:84%
There were little
flowers around it.

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Nothing grew in the middle,
and it was very barren.

00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to do some
testing in there of the soil.

00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And evidently, a lot of
soil had been put on it.

00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:51.947 align:middle line:84%
So we'd have to go 20
feet down to actually see.

00:50:51.947 --> 00:50:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you you did
get a plant, didn't you?

00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: When we got
back just recently,

00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:57.860 align:middle line:90%
it's filled with plants.

00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:59.530 align:middle line:90%
It's filled with cocklespur.

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: And it's
very, very toxic,

00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:04.990 align:middle line:84%
because the person
that I was with

00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:08.050 align:middle line:84%
happened to pull out the
plant, and his face blew up,

00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:11.430 align:middle line:84%
and he got a cortisol
reaction to it.

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:14.080 align:middle line:84%
His arms got all
red, and we almost

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.410 align:middle line:84%
had to take him to
the emergency room.

00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:18.260 align:middle line:84%
So the big mystery
and the big question

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:21.680 align:middle line:84%
is, who planted in that
circle where the craft

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:26.270 align:middle line:84%
landed the cocklespur, this
plant, this very toxic plant

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:28.420 align:middle line:84%
that we can't get
in there anymore?

00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:31.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like filling
the whole thing with poison ivy

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:32.400 align:middle line:90%
or poison oak.

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:33.200 align:middle line:90%
>>HARRIS: Exactly.

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:36.557 align:middle line:84%
And it's not anywhere
else in the 180,000 acres.

00:51:36.557 --> 00:51:37.390 align:middle line:90%
We couldn't find it.

00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:39.380 align:middle line:10%
We went looking for this plant.

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:45.130 align:middle line:10%
So it's been purposely so
that we won't dig there.

00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:48.372 align:middle line:10%
Because when the young
boys were doing this,

00:51:48.372 --> 00:51:49.830 align:middle line:10%
they didn't pick
up all the pieces.

00:51:49.830 --> 00:51:52.250 align:middle line:84%
They take their foot, and they
threw the pieces in a berm.

00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:53.666 align:middle line:84%
Because it was the
first time they

00:51:53.666 --> 00:51:56.330 align:middle line:84%
didn't feel like
vacuuming the place.

00:51:56.330 --> 00:52:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the big story is
that Jose went inside and took

00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:03.840 align:middle line:90%
a piece of the craft.

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:06.989 align:middle line:84%
And he and he wanted a
souvenir at nine years old.

00:52:06.989 --> 00:52:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, of course.

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:09.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: Because everybody
went to the Owl Bar and Cafe.

00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:11.873 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I want a souvenir,
goes in and pulls out a piece.

00:52:11.873 --> 00:52:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So where is it now?

00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HARRIS: The piece is
in a safe deposit box.

00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:17.770 align:middle line:90%
Good, for safe keeping.

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:20.460 align:middle line:90%
OK, to be continued.

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:21.440 align:middle line:10%
Thank you, Paola.

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Paola and I are going to
continue this conversation

00:52:23.730 --> 00:52:26.780 align:middle line:84%
addressing why so much
of the activity today

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:29.960 align:middle line:84%
is happening in South
America, Mexico, China,

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:32.210 align:middle line:84%
places other than
the United States.

00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:34.880 align:middle line:10%
In addition, Paola is going
to share an event that

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:38.100 align:middle line:10%
rocked her life when she went
from being an investigator

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:39.590 align:middle line:10%
to an experiencer.

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:41.940 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here
