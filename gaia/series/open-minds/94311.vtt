>>REGINA MEREDITH:
This story is not

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.160 align:middle line:84%
meant to ruin our Sunday
morning bacon and eggs, rather

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.370 align:middle line:84%
to help us become more
discerning about how

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.270 align:middle line:84%
the pig that gave us the
bacon lived their life.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Toward that end,
information will

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.510 align:middle line:84%
help us make better
decisions in our purchasing.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Lady Tracy Worcester is
spending her entire life

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.470 align:middle line:84%
educating people as to the
difference between farm

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.840 align:middle line:90%
and factory raised pork.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.792 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:49.964 align:middle line:90%


00:00:49.964 --> 00:00:51.791 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's so
good to have you here.

00:00:51.791 --> 00:00:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I had the pleasure of meeting
with you off camera beforehand

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.450 align:middle line:84%
to find out a little
bit more about you.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And what an interesting
life you have.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And you're in a
unique position to be

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.239 align:middle line:84%
able to spend your time
doing exactly what you love.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we were
talking about off camera.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So before we get
going on the subject

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.720 align:middle line:84%
at hand-- which
is a little harsh,

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.020 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have a
little bit of video in it,

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.760 align:middle line:84%
but very necessary for us to
be aware of-- our audience

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.646 align:middle line:84%
would like to know
more about you.

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>>LADY TRACY WORCESTER: Right.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, I was an actress.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.980 align:middle line:10%
And in love with a
man who, for two years

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.950 align:middle line:10%
we were going out together,
and then when he proposed

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.950 align:middle line:10%
and I wanted to stay with
him and have children,

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.842 align:middle line:10%
I decided to give up
acting and to work

00:01:38.842 --> 00:01:40.550 align:middle line:10%
in a field which I've
always cared about,

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.700 align:middle line:10%
which is the environment.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.705 align:middle line:84%
So I started working at Friends
of the Earth as a volunteer.

00:01:47.705 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And day one, I
never turned back.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Because it was so
fascinating, and the people

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.590 align:middle line:84%
were so interesting and
caring and loving and giving.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And you could see how, actually
the most selfish way to live

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.120 align:middle line:84%
is to give, because
you get so much back.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.090 align:middle line:84%
So to give to this movement
was hugely rewarding

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.890 align:middle line:84%
because you'd be
involved in campaigns

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.420 align:middle line:90%
like rainforest destruction.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.330 align:middle line:84%
So in that you would be
looking at the world's lungs.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.080 align:middle line:84%
You would be looking
at world's species.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.720 align:middle line:84%
So I became more
and more involved.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.470 align:middle line:84%
So when I had children,
we were in London

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.730 align:middle line:84%
and I could just, during the
holidays, be with the kids.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And then while they were
at school, campaign.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.210 align:middle line:84%
So my connections, either
from my background or from

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.680 align:middle line:84%
my marriage to a marquess,
which is really--

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.525 align:middle line:90%
my name's marchioness and--

00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
call you lady.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: And so--
well, marchioness

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.460 align:middle line:84%
can turn into a lady, as
can duchess or any title

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.120 align:middle line:90%
can just have a shortened lady.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.070 align:middle line:84%
So Lady Worcester,
Tracy Worcester.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.357 align:middle line:84%
And so I used the contact--
because sometimes the media

00:03:04.357 --> 00:03:06.940 align:middle line:84%
would be more interested in me
because it was the marchioness.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.020 align:middle line:84%
But it was a double edged
sword because they'd

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.170 align:middle line:84%
say Lady Muck gets her
hands dirty by looking

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.960 align:middle line:84%
at organic food growing, local
food for the local farmers

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.660 align:middle line:90%
market.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And I had a little
store in my garden

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and the local shop
and Bath farmers

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.580 align:middle line:84%
market, which was the first
one to open in this country,

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.580 align:middle line:90%
and now there's like 400.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.045 align:middle line:84%
So I've always been supporting
the local food movement.

00:03:33.045 --> 00:03:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
you're talking about

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:84%
is a double edged
sword in the media

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.190 align:middle line:84%
for getting your fingernails
dirty when people would guess

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.870 align:middle line:84%
you would be at a tea
party instead, for example.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.370 align:middle line:90%
That is a-- it's a misnomer.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.470 align:middle line:84%
But this reminds me
of Prince Charles.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And I know that in
this country there

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.330 align:middle line:84%
seems to be a very strange
relationship toward Prince

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Charles and his work
in the-- not just

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.650 align:middle line:84%
environmental movement--
organics and so forth.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And the stories seem
a little parallel.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think I read that
he attended your wedding.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.180 align:middle line:90%
Is that accurate?

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Yes.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.280 align:middle line:84%
So did the two of you ever--
have you ever kind of connected

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.880 align:middle line:90%
on the level of your activism?

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Yes, in
that he's obviously

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.460 align:middle line:84%
promoting, in an
incredibly important way,

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.070 align:middle line:84%
organic, local--
scale is important,

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.110 align:middle line:90%
but it's not everything.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have
a giant organic farm,

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.650 align:middle line:84%
the costs are internalized so
the smaller ones can compete.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So I remember at one point when
the media was being quite cruel

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.740 align:middle line:84%
to me if I'd say
something which was

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.400 align:middle line:84%
against the big corporations,
I remember he wrote back

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and he said, just don't read
the interviews that you do.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:84%
You just have to keep going
because you believe in it.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.040 align:middle line:84%
But there's a hell of a
lot of people out there

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.310 align:middle line:84%
who are protective of their
ways of farming, which

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.470 align:middle line:84%
might be to try and stay in
business, to pour chemicals

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.220 align:middle line:84%
all of over the land because
that is mass production,

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.917 align:middle line:84%
and if you get more
out of the land--

00:05:06.917 --> 00:05:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:08.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: The common
agricultural policy

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:90%
is to pay you more money.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.248 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're going
to be slammed in the media.

00:05:12.248 --> 00:05:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: So there
was always the mixture.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Some people appreciate it,
some people couldn't help

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle line:90%
but doing a stab or two.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.629 align:middle line:84%
And I just had to rise above
it and just keep campaigning.

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And I remember fondly enough
one of my first interviews

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.830 align:middle line:84%
in television when I was-- did
a rainforest ball with Imran

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.460 align:middle line:90%
Khan.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.909 align:middle line:84%
And the interviewer said,
you're doing this work

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:36.200 align:middle line:84%
for the ecological movement
because you quite obviously

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.524 align:middle line:90%
feel so guilty being so wealthy.

00:05:38.524 --> 00:05:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What a
presumptuous statement.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Well, do
you know something?

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I respect where
he's coming from.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Because there is a hell of a
lot of poverty in the world,

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.610 align:middle line:84%
and there's a hell of a lot
of very, very wealthy people.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And the gap between the
wealthy and the poor

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.320 align:middle line:90%
is growing ever wider.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: And
we have to be aware

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.870 align:middle line:90%
that obviously that is wrong.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we
need to look at how

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.030 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that
people have enough.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And that people who
are small scale growers

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.050 align:middle line:84%
are paid enough money so that
they can feed their populous.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not just
enough, but quality.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:15.578 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Yep.

00:06:15.578 --> 00:06:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Back to quality again.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And so going back
to his statement,

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.530 align:middle line:84%
I said it was
presumptuous because I

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.280 align:middle line:84%
think that is
presumptuous to say that.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.190 align:middle line:84%
However, was he accurate
or was this something

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.882 align:middle line:84%
born entirely out of another
place of you-- inside you?

00:06:29.882 --> 00:06:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Do
you know something?

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to take away
his presumption to say,

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.070 align:middle line:90%
you've got too much.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of you
that have too much.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: So some
of you are going to go,

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.970 align:middle line:90%
I've got to give back.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So whether he calls it guilt or
whether he calls it conscience

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.010 align:middle line:84%
or whether he calls it you've
got the time and the privilege

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.320 align:middle line:84%
that you don't
need to get a job.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, to get a job in the
environmental movement today,

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.910 align:middle line:84%
it's so sought after that
your degree and your ability

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.264 align:middle line:84%
to write and public speak--
now, I didn't have that.

00:07:02.264 --> 00:07:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: So--

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
positioned well enough

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.750 align:middle line:90%
that you could do it.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.083 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: I could just do it.

00:07:07.083 --> 00:07:08.890 align:middle line:84%
So what I started by
doing was fundraising

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.473 align:middle line:84%
for the movement,
particularly Friends

00:07:10.473 --> 00:07:12.850 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth and the
Soil Association.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
to write for them,

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.041 align:middle line:84%
and then I got involved with a
group called the International

00:07:17.041 --> 00:07:18.860 align:middle line:90%
Society for Ecology and Culture.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.624 align:middle line:84%
And when she was away, I used
to do public speaking for her.

00:07:21.624 --> 00:07:23.415 align:middle line:84%
So I was sort of quite
put in the deep end.

00:07:23.415 --> 00:07:25.623 align:middle line:84%
But she was very, very
important because not only was

00:07:25.623 --> 00:07:30.350 align:middle line:84%
she saying that this global
trading system is fundamentally

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.105 align:middle line:84%
wrong, but she was saying we
have to shift to the local.

00:07:33.105 --> 00:07:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: We have to move our
production system to actually

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.005 align:middle line:84%
site here to sell here,
and particularly food.

00:07:41.005 --> 00:07:41.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: And in this
country-- we live on an island.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.055 align:middle line:84%
And many of the politicians
and big business

00:07:47.055 --> 00:07:48.930 align:middle line:84%
just say, well, we've
got the money from GDP.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.140 align:middle line:90%
We can buy in our crops.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.090 align:middle line:90%
We can't.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Because sooner or later, whether
it's the greenhouse effect

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.160 align:middle line:84%
or these wars that we're
creating across the world,

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.010 align:middle line:84%
increasingly the soil,
with too many chemicals,

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:03.025 align:middle line:90%
is becoming degraded.

00:08:03.025 --> 00:08:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.280 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: We're
have desertification.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.821 align:middle line:84%
People are going
turn around and say,

00:08:06.821 --> 00:08:10.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm not giving you my land to
feed your markets for peanuts--

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:11.560 align:middle line:90%
Ultimately--

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: --and not
paying us properly.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.330 align:middle line:90%
We want this food.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:15.890 align:middle line:90%
You look after yourselves.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And there are no farmers because
they've all gone bankrupt.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.040 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm doing
now is I want a life

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.540 align:middle line:84%
raft of small scale
or large scale,

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.650 align:middle line:84%
but farmers that are farming
in a way that is sustainable

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:33.190 align:middle line:84%
which is nurturing the soil
which has pure seeds, not

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.860 align:middle line:84%
genetically engineered
seeds, which are healthy,

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:40.409 align:middle line:84%
which are able to
take up the minerals,

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:43.750 align:middle line:84%
nutrients from the soil, into
the plant and into our bodies

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.250 align:middle line:90%
do that we're actually healthy.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.350 align:middle line:84%
And I've had
another little scare

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.070 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that
I do eat healthy.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.705 align:middle line:90%
And that is that I had cancer.

00:08:51.705 --> 00:08:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: And every
single doctor from whoever

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.444 align:middle line:84%
across the world is looking
at complementary medicine

00:08:59.444 --> 00:09:00.235 align:middle line:90%
to the traditional.

00:09:00.235 --> 00:09:04.920 align:middle line:84%
I did do the mastectomy and
the chemo and the Herceptin,

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.290 align:middle line:84%
but I also did
the supplementary,

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:13.870 align:middle line:84%
which is vitamins and
lysine, which is Doctor Roth.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And lots of supplements
that make sure that along

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:21.380 align:middle line:84%
with a basically vegan diet
with a little bit of proteins--

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.270 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of proteins come
from alternatives to meat.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.639 align:middle line:84%
Your diet is really
rich, and it's organic.

00:09:27.639 --> 00:09:28.305 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:09:28.305 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.938 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: So
I've never actually

00:09:29.938 --> 00:09:32.240 align:middle line:84%
felt healthier than when
I took to being a vegan.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, there's
the silver lining.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Yep.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what you
were just saying a moment ago,

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.620 align:middle line:84%
our governments
feel that we can,

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.540 align:middle line:84%
for the foreseeable future,
look to other countries

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.420 align:middle line:84%
to produce their crops for us
when those countries themselves

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.790 align:middle line:84%
can't afford the crops
for their own people.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.899 align:middle line:84%
This seems completely
unsustainable in the long term.

00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Well,
what's quite interesting

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.590 align:middle line:84%
now is the corporations and
the governments are still

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:01.340 align:middle line:84%
neoliberal with their
attitude to everything.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.250 align:middle line:84%
But increasingly, the Food
and Agriculture Organization,

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:06.860 align:middle line:84%
which is the part of the
UN, particularly the most

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:11.610 align:middle line:84%
recent special repertoire
on food and farming,

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:16.850 align:middle line:84%
is saying local farmers,
small scale farmers, women,

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.820 align:middle line:84%
have the land to feed
your family first.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's called
food sovereignty.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that happens
quite a lot in Africa.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.000 align:middle line:84%
It's the women that have the
small patches, the women that

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:28.925 align:middle line:90%
own the cow.

00:10:28.925 --> 00:10:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Well,
apparently 70% of the world

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.930 align:middle line:84%
is still fed by
small scale farmers.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.590 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, this
mass consolidation

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:42.140 align:middle line:84%
of farms across the world
is relativity small.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.170 align:middle line:90%
It's 30%.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:43.850 align:middle line:90%
It's new.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:44.490 align:middle line:90%
It's modern.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:47.460 align:middle line:84%
It's being promoted by
the agri industries.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.791 align:middle line:90%
And they are uber powerful.

00:10:48.791 --> 00:10:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, they are.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.405 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: And so
the agri industry

00:10:51.405 --> 00:10:52.965 align:middle line:84%
is now recognizing
that a lot of us

00:10:52.965 --> 00:10:56.109 align:middle line:84%
are getting very sick from their
chemicals, and we're objecting.

00:10:56.109 --> 00:10:56.900 align:middle line:90%
We don't want them.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.935 align:middle line:84%
And so they're coming up with
genetically engineered food.

00:10:59.935 --> 00:11:00.685 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:11:00.685 --> 00:11:01.643 align:middle line:90%
Oh, don't get us going.

00:11:01.643 --> 00:11:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: So we
have a huge number

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.530 align:middle line:84%
of people who are
saying, hang on a minute.

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:06.690 align:middle line:90%
That's more of the same.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.700 align:middle line:90%
That's extremely poisonous.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.060 align:middle line:84%
The countries which
have their fields

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:15.320 align:middle line:84%
covered in glyphosate, which
is the weed killer which

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.324 align:middle line:84%
goes with the genetically
engineered seeds.

00:11:17.324 --> 00:11:19.115 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We know it
in America as Roundup.

00:11:19.115 --> 00:11:19.864 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Yeah.

00:11:19.864 --> 00:11:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: OK.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, people are
very sick from that.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: And actually,
my working with pigs-- I

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.910 align:middle line:84%
spoke to a pig
farmer the other day

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.720 align:middle line:84%
and he said that
so many of the pigs

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.800 align:middle line:84%
were being born with
deformities or dead.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.916 align:middle line:84%
And he just couldn't understand
this huge increase and why

00:11:39.916 --> 00:11:41.540 align:middle line:84%
all the farmers were
just accepting it.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.500 align:middle line:84%
So he thought, well,
I'm going to change back

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.570 align:middle line:90%
to conventional feed.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And a tiny proportion
were then dying.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.340 align:middle line:84%
Tiny compared to
when they were being

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.490 align:middle line:84%
fed genetically
engineered crops.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.040 align:middle line:84%
So we need to look at
not only that we're not

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.550 align:middle line:84%
going to eat genetically
engineered crops directly,

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.215 align:middle line:84%
but we shouldn't
even be eating meat

00:12:00.215 --> 00:12:02.270 align:middle line:84%
that are being feed with
genetically engineered crops.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.428 align:middle line:84%
And this is the hidden
affect that people

00:12:04.428 --> 00:12:05.920 align:middle line:90%
don't take into consideration.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Just
have to read about it.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:09.980 align:middle line:90%
It's all there on the internet.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:10.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.776 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's talk about
what's on the internet.

00:12:12.776 --> 00:12:15.080 align:middle line:84%
Because I did watch
the documentary

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.830 align:middle line:84%
"Pig Business," which you
were the narrator and host of.

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And you did a beautiful
job in documenting

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.310 align:middle line:84%
the nature of this business and
the knocked on effects of it.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:28.140 align:middle line:84%
But let's start-- first
of all, why did you

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:32.630 align:middle line:84%
choose the subject of pig
farming and industrialization

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.442 align:middle line:90%
of pig farming?

00:12:34.442 --> 00:12:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Because
our farming system

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:41.800 align:middle line:84%
is fundamentally flawed
across the board.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.760 align:middle line:84%
So when I did public
speaking, people

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.140 align:middle line:84%
used to thank me for taking
the lid off the system.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.927 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, how can I
show people the system,

00:12:51.927 --> 00:12:54.530 align:middle line:84%
but within an
amount of time where

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:56.910 align:middle line:84%
they can stomach
watching something?

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.850 align:middle line:84%
So I have to start with one
subject in the farming system

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:03.160 align:middle line:84%
to be able to take it
up to how corporations

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.012 align:middle line:84%
have taken over
our food economy.

00:13:05.012 --> 00:13:05.970 align:middle line:90%
So I decided, well, OK.

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:09.390 align:middle line:84%
What's the most
important, urgent?

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.240 align:middle line:84%
The most, really,
broken of the system.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.080 align:middle line:90%
And that's the pigs.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.474 align:middle line:84%
Because pigs are the
most amazing animals.

00:13:18.474 --> 00:13:19.390 align:middle line:90%
They are so beautiful.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Please
tell us about pigs.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: They are so
clever, they are so charming.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.670 align:middle line:84%
They are the same
intelligence as our dogs.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And certainly in
this country, we're

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.250 align:middle line:84%
famous for looking after
animals better, unfortunately,

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:32.260 align:middle line:90%
than our kids.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.500 align:middle line:90%
We love animals.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.540 align:middle line:90%
So many people love pigs.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And actually, if you think
about it, a pig compared

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:42.360 align:middle line:84%
to a chicken or a fish,
actually people love pigs.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And yet the cruelty that we're
inflicting on those pigs,

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.950 align:middle line:84%
I think, is really a
reflection of how badly we're

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:53.007 align:middle line:84%
prepared to behave
on a broader issue.

00:13:53.007 --> 00:13:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, yes.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.006 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Whether it
vivisection or our children.

00:13:56.006 --> 00:13:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And other people
across the world.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.500 align:middle line:90%
We're so cruel.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.110 align:middle line:84%
But with animals, actually,
we have a soft spot.

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.230 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, OK, I'll
go to the emotional side.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.565 align:middle line:84%
And I'll show all
the external costs.

00:14:07.565 --> 00:14:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And so this beautiful,
huge animal,

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:16.689 align:middle line:84%
the ideology of the neocon,
liberal-- and the union

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:18.480 align:middle line:84%
that represents the
farmers in this country

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.315 align:middle line:84%
has this ideology,
which let's make

00:14:20.315 --> 00:14:23.030 align:middle line:90%
a three ton-- no, two ton pig.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.620 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you're going
to have little rhinoceroses

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:30.310 align:middle line:84%
in these sheds so that you
can double the amount of meat

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.130 align:middle line:90%
on the pig.

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:34.230 align:middle line:84%
So you're producing
monsters that can't move,

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.140 align:middle line:84%
that are made almost
like you're producing

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:90%
a more sophisticated car.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:41.320 align:middle line:84%
Do we want to do
that to our animals?

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:45.140 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they've been bred
to being good for eating.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.730 align:middle line:84%
But actually, very
often those breeds

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.460 align:middle line:84%
are not really very
good at continuing

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.200 align:middle line:84%
the life of a happy
pig, which is outside

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.840 align:middle line:90%
or has access to outside.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:15:00.210 align:middle line:84%
They're being bred presently
to just about stomach

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.240 align:middle line:84%
sitting in a crate
all their life,

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:06.012 align:middle line:84%
stuffed with antibiotics
to keep them alive.

00:15:06.012 --> 00:15:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Now as we know from
hospitals, when

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:08.980 align:middle line:84%
you give too many
antibiotics, you

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.115 align:middle line:84%
get antibiotic
resistant diseases.

00:15:11.115 --> 00:15:11.979 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:11.979 --> 00:15:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Spread
between the pigs.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.090 align:middle line:84%
But it also goes
on to the worker,

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:17.700 align:middle line:84%
goes out of the
ventilation shafts.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.210 align:middle line:84%
It goes into the
environment when

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.866 align:middle line:90%
you spray it on the fields.

00:15:20.866 --> 00:15:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So people are ingesting
it through the water,

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.200 align:middle line:84%
through the air, even
if you're a vegetarian.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.155 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's passed on through
their feces and the urine

00:15:26.155 --> 00:15:26.500 align:middle line:90%
and such, right?

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Yep.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.160 align:middle line:90%
It's biodegrading feces.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.940 align:middle line:84%
You have not only the
antibiotics in the feces,

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:35.690 align:middle line:84%
but you also have a
problem which comes up

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:39.630 align:middle line:84%
through the slats in the floors,
which is ammonia and hydrogen

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:43.460 align:middle line:84%
sulfide from that feces, which
makes the workers extremely

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.650 align:middle line:90%
sick, the neighbors very sick.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:50.310 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a system here
which is really very flawed

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:54.280 align:middle line:90%
and nobody is internalizing it.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, whether it be
England, Europe, America,

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:02.320 align:middle line:84%
China, India-- they're all
saying consolidate your pig

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:07.287 align:middle line:84%
factories into these
giant consolidated animal

00:16:07.287 --> 00:16:08.120 align:middle line:90%
concentration camps.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
go talk about one of them

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.290 align:middle line:90%
in just a moment.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:15.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you feature
North Carolina in America

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:18.730 align:middle line:84%
prominently in this film
and one particular company.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.810 align:middle line:84%
But before we go there, from
your current understanding

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:26.020 align:middle line:84%
of the stats, what percentage
of the pork that we're eating,

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:31.350 align:middle line:84%
in the Western world anyway,
is from these large factories

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:33.700 align:middle line:90%
versus local farms?

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Well,
thing is I actually

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:38.420 align:middle line:90%
only really know about England.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's
go with England.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: So
England, I would say,

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:46.560 align:middle line:84%
it's 60% of the pork on
the supermarket shelf

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.770 align:middle line:90%
is from a factory.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:49.660 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:56.370 align:middle line:84%
40% is from outdoor bred,
which means-- because we

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.940 align:middle line:84%
had those crates
banned in this country

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.230 align:middle line:84%
10 years ago thanks to
Compassion in World Farming--

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:04.680 align:middle line:84%
the farmers had to
find another way.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And what they
decided was economic

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.089 align:middle line:90%
was to have to mama outside.

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:13.150 align:middle line:84%
So 40% of those moms are
outside having their litters.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:14.240 align:middle line:90%
Which is fantastic.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.210 align:middle line:90%
It's the highest in the world.

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:19.770 align:middle line:90%
And then those piglets come in.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:22.619 align:middle line:90%
Only 2% stay outside.

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And they usually
come in to farms

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.880 align:middle line:84%
with straw, which is called
Freedom Food standard.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.910 align:middle line:84%
So we have the choice, as
consumers in this country,

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:35.640 align:middle line:84%
to choose meat from
farms that the animal has

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.280 align:middle line:84%
had a decent life,
where you haven't

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.900 align:middle line:84%
had antibiotic resistant
diseases-- because those pigs

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:45.270 align:middle line:84%
outside and in sheds with
straw with enough room

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.480 align:middle line:84%
up to the Freedom
Food standards,

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.480 align:middle line:90%
they don't need antibiotics.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.490 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to see
the end of antibiotics thanks

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:55.290 align:middle line:84%
to a farming system
which doesn't internalize

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.460 align:middle line:84%
the real cost of
this cruel system

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.900 align:middle line:84%
where they're in a crate which
is pouring into Britain thanks

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.530 align:middle line:90%
to our own higher standards.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Which actually has been
not kind on farmers

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:07.590 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
the farmers have

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:11.150 align:middle line:84%
gone bankrupt because
of the higher price.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:15.910 align:middle line:84%
So they've chosen to buy the
cheaper pork on those shelves.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I've taken
it on myself, because I've

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:24.260 align:middle line:84%
spoken to so many people who say
I would buy high animal welfare

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.410 align:middle line:90%
pork, but it's more expensive.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And what difference does it
make if I do it on my own?

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So I know that if it became
a huge movement, if we stood

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:40.450 align:middle line:84%
in solidarity against the
corporations and the cruelty,

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:45.420 align:middle line:84%
we would have many, many more
pigs that had had decent lives.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And we would--
otherwise what happens,

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:50.306 align:middle line:84%
you go into your supermarket and
you see rows and rows and rows

00:18:50.306 --> 00:18:53.220 align:middle line:84%
and rows of cheap-- people
piling their baskets from

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:53.790 align:middle line:90%
the cheap--

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From Tesco and--

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: And then a
tiny, tiny little section,

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.660 align:middle line:84%
which is a little
bit more expensive,

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and you just think,
why should I do that?

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:00.746 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How much
more expensive?

00:19:00.746 --> 00:19:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Well, we'd say
that two sausages from a factory

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:12.770 align:middle line:84%
farm costs the same as one and a
half from a high animal welfare

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.030 align:middle line:90%
farm.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, what the
doctors are saying is

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:18.510 align:middle line:90%
we're eating too much meat.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And many of us have
parents or at least

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.325 align:middle line:84%
grandparents who remember
when meat was a treat.

00:19:25.325 --> 00:19:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.551 align:middle line:84%
And served in very
tiny portions.

00:19:28.551 --> 00:19:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Yeah.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.282 align:middle line:90%
And that's sustainable.

00:19:30.282 --> 00:19:34.140 align:middle line:84%
We could eat a small
portion of meat per day.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Not only sustainable
for the planet,

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:39.280 align:middle line:84%
sustainable for our health
with antibiotic resistance

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.560 align:middle line:90%
not needed anymore.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.760 align:middle line:84%
But actually healthier because
the doctors are saying you're

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.940 align:middle line:84%
getting cancer,
obesity, heart disease

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.770 align:middle line:90%
from eating too much protein.

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.630 align:middle line:84%
So we need to reduce it
anyway to be healthier.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And wouldn't we prefer to
take back control of our food?

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Because who do we dote on more
than anybody in the world?

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:02.280 align:middle line:90%
Our kids.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.620 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what we'd really like
is to have a planet which

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:09.150 align:middle line:84%
can sustain their lives
to feed themselves.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm afraid
the factory farming

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:14.820 align:middle line:84%
system is totally unsustainable
because also you're

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.840 align:middle line:84%
growing crops in areas
that were rainforest.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.010 align:middle line:84%
So you're replacing
the lungs of the Earth

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:22.490 align:middle line:84%
with all the species that
we need for medication,

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:26.230 align:middle line:84%
chopping it down, and having
it as soil plantations

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:29.337 align:middle line:84%
to feed pigs many,
many miles away.

00:20:29.337 --> 00:20:30.795 align:middle line:84%
You've got a sort
of global system.

00:20:30.795 --> 00:20:33.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about the feed supply.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.310 align:middle line:90%
And let's start at the feed end.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Normally pigs would be fed
whatever the farmer feeds them

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:43.250 align:middle line:90%
in their hay in the pen, right?

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Or they would feed on grass.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:45.802 align:middle line:90%
Do they feed on grass as well?

00:20:45.802 --> 00:20:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Yes.

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.495 align:middle line:84%
So they would be
out there grazing?

00:20:48.495 --> 00:20:49.203 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Yes.

00:20:49.203 --> 00:20:49.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.570 align:middle line:84%
So we know what a normal
diet would look like.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:56.050 align:middle line:84%
But what do pigs in the
factories environment

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:57.000 align:middle line:90%
actually eat?

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.330 align:middle line:90%
Where does it come from?

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about the trickle
down effect of their food--

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.807 align:middle line:84%
not even including the
genetically modified element.

00:21:04.807 --> 00:21:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Just the way they food is
produced, where it's produced,

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.490 align:middle line:84%
what the toxic effects
are to the communities

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:12.525 align:middle line:84%
and the environment
at large onto the pig.

00:21:12.525 --> 00:21:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Right.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, in America there used
to be loads and loads--

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:20.820 align:middle line:90%
and I mean millions.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the
same number of pigs

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.690 align:middle line:84%
produced 80 years ago
as there is today.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:30.580 align:middle line:84%
But there were many, many small
farmers with the pigs outside

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.080 align:middle line:90%
and they would eat the grass.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.590 align:middle line:84%
But they would also
be looking for roots.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And all of our excess
food-- proteins

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:39.990 align:middle line:84%
as well-- would be
given to the pigs.

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:42.122 align:middle line:84%
They would be extremely
healthy and lots of money

00:21:42.122 --> 00:21:43.080 align:middle line:90%
going to local farmers.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they called
it pig slop in America.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:45.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Yeah.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The bucket of
leftovers right into the pen.

00:21:48.435 --> 00:21:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Exactly.

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And then you eat
the pig and then

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:54.462 align:middle line:84%
the pig's feces is very, very
sustainable into the soil.

00:21:54.462 --> 00:21:56.920 align:middle line:84%
There's not too much of it so
it doesn't pollute the river.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Whereas now, what
Murphy decided to do

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.360 align:middle line:84%
was, just like the chicken
industry led by Tyson,

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:08.170 align:middle line:84%
he would shove the
pigs in these crates.

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.810 align:middle line:84%
So he would make all the
money and take that away

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.110 align:middle line:90%
from the small scale farmers.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:16.360 align:middle line:84%
There was so much feces
coming out of those sheds,

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.130 align:middle line:84%
it was far too much to
put on the land locally.

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:23.780 align:middle line:84%
So the pollution is
intolerable, both for the health

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:27.180 align:middle line:84%
of the local people because
of the hydrogen sulfide

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and ammonia from the
biodegrading feces on the land.

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:34.520 align:middle line:90%
So the villagers get sick.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.210 align:middle line:84%
So you've also got a
huge amount of soil

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:40.510 align:middle line:84%
coming in from what were
rainforest areas or cerrado

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:44.730 align:middle line:84%
areas, places like Argentina,
transported-- actually

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.930 align:middle line:84%
in America, I think
quite a lot of that soil

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.110 align:middle line:90%
is grown locally in America.

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:51.750 align:middle line:84%
But in Europe, it all
comes from South America,

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:54.000 align:middle line:90%
replacing forests.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.530 align:middle line:84%
A huge footprint as far
as transport is concerned.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And as it's a protein plant, it
would be much better in Europe

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.610 align:middle line:84%
if we grew our own protein
plants on the farm.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Because those plants replace
nutrients from the soil.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.770 align:middle line:84%
So they're very, very
healthy to grow locally.

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:15.380 align:middle line:84%
So really what we
would like to see

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:21.660 align:middle line:84%
is a site here to sell
here attitude of our food.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:27.280 align:middle line:84%
So--and it would be as
sustainable as the consumer

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.180 align:middle line:90%
chooses.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.500 align:middle line:84%
So I would say there's
a range of symbols

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:36.660 align:middle line:84%
in this country from UK-- you
can choose UK where you have

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.910 align:middle line:84%
the better crate system
where they're only allowed

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.950 align:middle line:84%
to be in a crate when
they've had their babies.

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:42.450 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Or you go higher and
you go to Freedom Food

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:49.280 align:middle line:84%
where they're not
in a crate at all.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.320 align:middle line:84%
When they're having their babies
they're-- it's just much larger

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.890 align:middle line:90%
space.

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Or-- and they're not allowed,
obviously again in England,

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:01.450 align:middle line:84%
in the crate at all
when they're pregnant.

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And they've got straw
with Freedom Foods.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Or you go higher to outdoor
bred and then outdoor raised

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:10.170 align:middle line:90%
or free range.

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Or best of all is organic, where
the feed cannot be genetically

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:15.510 align:middle line:90%
engineered.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so really
it's been the consumer that

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:21.240 align:middle line:84%
has driven this
for the most part?

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Is it really that we're--
the industry can succeed

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.450 align:middle line:84%
because we're that
cost conscious?

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:32.030 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about running
thousands, tens of thousands,

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:35.820 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of thousands of
small farmers out of business.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Give of us a diagram of how
that happens, how that occurs,

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:40.800 align:middle line:84%
so that these
kinds of industries

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.790 align:middle line:84%
can succeed at
everybody's expense.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Well,
what they appeal

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:50.030 align:middle line:84%
to is our desire to
buy things cheap.

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:55.170 align:middle line:84%
So they will make
the pork cheaper.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:58.170 align:middle line:90%
So they'll push down the price.

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And basically what
happens is they

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.750 align:middle line:90%
will buy up many, many farms.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And they will have these huge
concentration camps of animals.

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And they will make sure that
that animal is very, very

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:11.420 align:middle line:90%
cheap.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:15.840 align:middle line:84%
But as they make the
money from the packets--

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.860 align:middle line:84%
because they've
slaughtered the pigs,

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.200 align:middle line:84%
they've processed the
pigs-- they don't really

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.130 align:middle line:84%
care how cheap the
pig is for them.

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:25.740 align:middle line:84%
So all of the farmers are
bankrupt because they cannot

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:26.240 align:middle line:90%
afford--

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They can't compete.

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: No.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.963 align:middle line:84%
They can't sell anywhere,
their pigs to slaughterhouses,

00:25:29.963 --> 00:25:32.300 align:middle line:84%
because they're all owned
by these giant processing

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.400 align:middle line:90%
companies like Smithfield.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And so you're
getting a situation

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:42.330 align:middle line:84%
where there are no small scale
farmers because the consumer is

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:44.050 align:middle line:90%
going to the supermarket.

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:49.430 align:middle line:84%
But in Britain, you actually do
have a very conscious consumer

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:51.600 align:middle line:84%
thanks to campaigns
like Compassion

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.690 align:middle line:84%
in World Farming and
the Soil Association.

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And us, which is called
Farms Not Factories.

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And I've worked now for 26 years
in the environmental movement.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And I've found myself
speaking in venues

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:08.030 align:middle line:84%
where I could literally
recognize most of the audience.

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that we're not
getting our message out far

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:12.040 align:middle line:90%
enough.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.300 align:middle line:90%
So I turned to film.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I made "Pig Business,"
which went out on Channel Four.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.780 align:middle line:84%
It went-- we took it
to the UK government.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.640 align:middle line:84%
We took it to the
EU and to Congress.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And then it's gone global;
it's sold globally.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And then we decided
to answer requests

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.880 align:middle line:84%
to people in many
different countries

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.230 align:middle line:84%
to come and film the
situation for them.

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And we basically did a film in
Romania, in Ecuador, in Chile,

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:45.860 align:middle line:90%
in America, and Canada.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Poland featured.

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: In Poland.

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:49.850 align:middle line:84%
That was in the
main film in which

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:51.830 align:middle line:90%
we featured America and Poland.

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:54.989 align:middle line:84%
And actually, we won
a prize in Romania,

00:26:54.989 --> 00:26:56.530 align:middle line:84%
and we've just today
heard that we've

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:59.580 align:middle line:84%
won a prize for
our Chilean film.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically trying
to get the message.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And when people say to me,
I've seen your film , Tracy,

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.340 align:middle line:84%
and I don't buy that
cheap pork anymore.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I don't see how
anyone that could see the film

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:11.909 align:middle line:90%
would do that again.

00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: And it's not just
looking at the cruelty, is it?

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:15.408 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, it's not.

00:27:15.408 --> 00:27:17.620 align:middle line:84%
You're looking all
of the implications.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.430 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say,
I think it only

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:23.910 align:middle line:84%
takes about 30 or
40 frames of seeing

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:27.770 align:middle line:84%
how these little pigs
live to turn you away

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:30.240 align:middle line:90%
from factory raised pork.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.850 align:middle line:84%
I actually have to
say, I was a vegetarian

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:37.852 align:middle line:84%
for 20 years solely on
animal rights issues,

00:27:37.852 --> 00:27:39.060 align:middle line:90%
not because of health at all.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.540 align:middle line:84%
I had no need to be
on a health level,

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:42.950 align:middle line:90%
that I was aware of anyway.

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:47.600 align:middle line:84%
But watching your film, it
kept bringing tears to my eyes.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.500 align:middle line:90%
Just the little bits.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.277 align:middle line:90%
And you were not gratuitous.

00:27:50.277 --> 00:27:52.360 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think the film
was gratuitous in any way.

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.290 align:middle line:90%
You didn't pound people with it.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:56.810 align:middle line:84%
But if you have any
sensitivity toward animals,

00:27:56.810 --> 00:28:01.070 align:middle line:84%
you can see that this
is completely immoral

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:02.510 align:middle line:90%
to treat animals in this way.

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Yeah.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.390 align:middle line:84%
What I wanted to
show is-- actually,

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:06.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't go into the cruelty.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:07.485 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, you did not.

00:28:07.485 --> 00:28:07.910 align:middle line:90%
No, you didn't.

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:09.576 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: There
is appalling cruelty.

00:28:09.576 --> 00:28:12.807 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted to appeal to people
who actually don't so much care

00:28:12.807 --> 00:28:13.890 align:middle line:90%
about the animals as well.

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:16.717 align:middle line:84%
People who realize that
they're going to get sick

00:28:16.717 --> 00:28:18.300 align:middle line:84%
because you have to
give these animals

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.750 align:middle line:90%
antibiotics to keep them alive.

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And you get antibiotic bacteria
coming out of those sheds.

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And government officials,
doctors, medical people

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:28.530 align:middle line:84%
and World Health
Organization have said,

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:30.940 align:middle line:90%
it is serious what we're doing.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Giving the antibiotics that
we give humans to the pigs

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and seeing them mutate into
antibiotic resistant bacteria.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.570 align:middle line:84%
We will die of
illnesses that we could

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:47.100 align:middle line:84%
very easily-- before
this antibiotic resistant

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:50.030 align:middle line:84%
bacteria problem--
we could easily cure.

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:51.750 align:middle line:84%
We're going to die
from those diseases.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:54.040 align:middle line:84%
So it appeals to
people on many levels.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And let's get into some
of the issues regarding

00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:00.370 align:middle line:84%
what it's doing to the local
populations and cultures, where

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.260 align:middle line:84%
pig farming was happening
quite naturally.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.860 align:middle line:84%
We can go into
the North Carolina

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.710 align:middle line:84%
scenario and Smithfield
and talk about what

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:11.790 align:middle line:84%
happens surrounding the pig
farms with the local populace.

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:13.590 align:middle line:84%
This is another
area you went into.

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:16.990 align:middle line:84%
You really did a good job of
going into all of the effects.

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Well,
I believe that if we

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:23.340 align:middle line:84%
are to keep human
beings on the planet,

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:26.480 align:middle line:84%
we need to have farmers
with real skills

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.550 align:middle line:84%
that are not
dependent on chemicals

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:31.306 align:middle line:84%
and mechanization,
which uses oil.

00:29:31.306 --> 00:29:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: And these factory
farms, they are so huge.

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.250 align:middle line:90%
They're all mechanized.

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.130 align:middle line:90%
The feed is mechanized.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:44.113 align:middle line:84%
The whole system is incredibly
expensive, even to build it.

00:29:44.113 --> 00:29:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in Canada we
were with a organic outdoor

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.980 align:middle line:84%
raised incredibly
beautiful pig farmer.

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And he said that
farmers came to his farm

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:57.280 align:middle line:84%
and said if only I
hadn't become mechanized.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Because I invested so much of my
money that I'm totally in debt.

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm not making money
from having consolidated.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And I would love to
be farming like this.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And more and more
people are demanding

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.635 align:middle line:84%
the outdoor raised,
the healthier pig.

00:30:13.635 --> 00:30:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to not only buy
the food from those farmers

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:23.695 align:middle line:84%
which are hanging on by
their fingernails to try

00:30:23.695 --> 00:30:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and look after
their pigs properly

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.770 align:middle line:84%
to sell to the
local communities,

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:31.030 align:middle line:84%
we need to buy those
animals so that we

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.585 align:middle line:84%
keep our skilled
farmers farming.

00:30:33.585 --> 00:30:36.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we keep the people
that live there and around them

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.140 align:middle line:90%
healthy.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.630 align:middle line:84%
These people have
horrific effects.

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:42.680 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like particularly
respiratory effects and sinus

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.610 align:middle line:84%
effects and such from
living around these very

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:46.900 align:middle line:90%
large facilities.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:50.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Well, we're
fighting the Midland Pig

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Producers at the moment,
who have been backed

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:56.760 align:middle line:84%
by a multi-multimillionare
who want to have planning

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:01.574 align:middle line:84%
permission to build a 25,000
pig pig shed, which is small

00:31:01.574 --> 00:31:03.240 align:middle line:84%
compared to American
standards, but it's

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:06.530 align:middle line:84%
huge in terms of
British standards.

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:10.387 align:middle line:84%
And it's 150 yards
from a women's prison.

00:31:10.387 --> 00:31:11.345 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, goodness.

00:31:11.345 --> 00:31:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: So these
women can't get away

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.362 align:middle line:84%
from exactly what you
were talking about.

00:31:15.362 --> 00:31:16.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Can't even breathe.

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Which
is the ammonia,

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.410 align:middle line:84%
which stops their
bronchi working.

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:25.710 align:middle line:84%
The hydrogen sulfide,
which is stink

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:27.370 align:middle line:90%
like a sort of rotten egg.

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:29.400 align:middle line:90%
It makes them depressed.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.070 align:middle line:84%
The noise, the lights
all night, the cruelty,

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:34.430 align:middle line:90%
the squeals from the animals.

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And I actually got
a doctor to-- sorry.

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Actually we got a lawyer
to write to the council

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:48.266 align:middle line:84%
to say if you give permission
for this animal factory

00:31:48.266 --> 00:31:51.840 align:middle line:84%
and any of the
prisoners get sick,

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.040 align:middle line:84%
they could sue you in
the court of human rights

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.030 align:middle line:84%
because you knew from
all the information--

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What the
effects were going to be.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:57.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.126 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: --on the
internet about how

00:31:59.126 --> 00:32:01.330 align:middle line:84%
people get sick living
outside these factory farms.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've
gone to some length

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.060 align:middle line:84%
to bring this
information forward.

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:06.900 align:middle line:90%
You've traveled to these places.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.150 align:middle line:90%
And were you-- where were you?

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:09.816 align:middle line:84%
Were you were you in
America or were you

00:32:09.816 --> 00:32:11.800 align:middle line:84%
in Poland when--
I saw you climbing

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.850 align:middle line:84%
a fence in the documentary
trying to get closer

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:16.370 align:middle line:90%
to get images from inside.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:17.870 align:middle line:84%
We're going to,
while we're talking,

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:20.050 align:middle line:90%
show just a little bit of film.

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:22.364 align:middle line:84%
You weren't able to
get your crew inside

00:32:22.364 --> 00:32:24.030 align:middle line:84%
once you climbed over
the fence, but you

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:27.280 align:middle line:84%
said that another crew
was able to do that,

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.690 align:middle line:84%
and they were able to
surreptitiously get

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:31.700 align:middle line:84%
some of the film of
the living conditions.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.540 align:middle line:90%
And, my God.

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:35.250 align:middle line:90%
Watching these poor little pigs.

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:40.030 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like watching
maggots moving over each other.

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:43.328 align:middle line:90%
They're so packed together.

00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:44.920 align:middle line:10%
>>WORCESTER: Later
in the same year,

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.905 align:middle line:10%
another team from
Compassion and World Farming

00:32:46.905 --> 00:32:50.620 align:middle line:10%
managed to do what I'd struggled
to do the year before-- get

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.936 align:middle line:10%
inside one of Smithfield's farms
at the village of Wojkowice.

00:32:53.936 --> 00:32:58.373 align:middle line:90%
[GRUNTING]

00:32:58.373 --> 00:33:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Pigs
in factory farms

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:01.860 align:middle line:84%
are usually raised
on bare slats,

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.932 align:middle line:84%
but even on straw they
don't look healthy.

>>WORCESTER: Well, I
think that people do care.

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:23.110 align:middle line:10%
They really do when they see
those films and the internet

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.930 align:middle line:10%
is full them.

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:26.200 align:middle line:10%
And they just have to--
some of the women just

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.680 align:middle line:10%
get scared that they
would be made ill

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.645 align:middle line:10%
from the depression
of seeing the way

00:33:31.645 --> 00:33:33.020 align:middle line:10%
that we're treating
these animals

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.350 align:middle line:10%
and they just don't
watch it and they just

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:37.220 align:middle line:10%
carry on buying the cheap meat.

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:41.680 align:middle line:90%
We can turn a blind eye to it.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.720 align:middle line:84%
We have that ability in the
face of incredible cruelty.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Well, that's
what my work is about now.

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:52.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to
influence consumers

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.570 align:middle line:84%
by making short films,
funny films, making

00:33:56.570 --> 00:34:02.440 align:middle line:84%
it a short but very,
very informative film

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:07.450 align:middle line:84%
so that they are aware of
what their choices mean.

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And we will go on
using celebrities

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:14.460 align:middle line:84%
like Stephen Fry or
Bobby Kennedy or--

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, he was
a hero in your film.

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:17.921 align:middle line:90%
Robert Kennedy, Jr.

00:34:17.921 --> 00:34:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Yeah.

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:19.010 align:middle line:90%
Isn't he amazing?

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:21.218 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he's a wonderful
activist in this area.

00:34:21.218 --> 00:34:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Yeah.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.300 align:middle line:90%
He's such a good man.

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.500 align:middle line:90%
He's so articulate.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And I got a lot of
high profile people

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:30.480 align:middle line:84%
who are prepared to
take the message further

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.960 align:middle line:84%
than quite a lot of
NGOs are able to do.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's my sort of
contribution to the movement.

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And I work with a
very good filmmaker

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:42.870 align:middle line:84%
who can make these very
short, very savvy films.

00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.659 align:middle line:84%
And we just need
more and more people

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:50.530 align:middle line:84%
to sign the pig pledge, which
means if they do eat meat,

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:55.170 align:middle line:84%
to ensure that it comes from
a farm, not an animal factory.

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:56.989 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A factory.

00:34:56.989 --> 00:35:01.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is actually--
you don't hear as much

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:05.320 align:middle line:84%
about it in the United
States as in Britain.

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not as obvious that
you have these local choices

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:08.720 align:middle line:90%
a lot of times.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:12.869 align:middle line:84%
But that said, are you familiar
with Niman Ranch in America?

00:35:12.869 --> 00:35:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Mmhmm.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:14.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now they've
made great headway.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And can you talk about
Niman Ranch a bit?

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And can you talk
about the difference

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:24.790 align:middle line:84%
between the ones that are--
what's it called, depenned?

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:27.270 align:middle line:84%
The way they're raised
in straw where everything

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:29.150 align:middle line:84%
breaks down very
naturally beneath them

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:30.170 align:middle line:90%
if they are in a pen.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:31.161 align:middle line:90%
They can move around.

00:35:31.161 --> 00:35:32.410 align:middle line:90%
They stay with their families.

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:34.330 align:middle line:84%
This is a big deal,
that the animals

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:38.260 align:middle line:84%
stay with the families they
were born into socially

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:42.036 align:middle line:90%
is more healthy for them.

00:35:42.036 --> 00:35:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So talk a little bit
about Niman Ranch.

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Because you can find
that in most stores

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.015 align:middle line:84%
with any consciousness
at all now in the US.

00:35:48.015 --> 00:35:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Yeah.

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:51.150 align:middle line:84%
I'd say that Britain
and America is

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:55.380 align:middle line:84%
really good at having these
high animal welfare labels.

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So all we have to do
is inform ourselves

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:01.090 align:middle line:84%
a little bit from maybe
watching the films,

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:05.900 align:middle line:84%
from very good campaigns like
the Humane Society in America.

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Or look up Bobby
Kennedy and he's

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:11.650 align:middle line:84%
fought so many cases to try
to sue these big companies so

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:14.040 align:middle line:84%
that they have to
start obeying the law.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.215 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I believe
Smithfield has come over

00:36:16.215 --> 00:36:16.715 align:middle line:90%
to Europe.

00:36:16.715 --> 00:36:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Because actually it's been
restrained quite a lot

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:20.360 align:middle line:90%
in America.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's trying to
change our farms

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:25.440 align:middle line:90%
into these gargantuan farms.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.856 align:middle line:84%
And you had a very,
very good film

00:36:26.856 --> 00:36:29.930 align:middle line:84%
which was made in America
called "Food, Inc."

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:31.320 align:middle line:90%
that just-- look it up.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.360 align:middle line:90%
Watch it.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.050 align:middle line:90%
Become informed.

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Recognize that this is
a corporate takeover

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.120 align:middle line:90%
of our lives.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Capitalism is now
corporate capitalism.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:44.190 align:middle line:84%
So you have a very,
very few companies

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:46.940 align:middle line:84%
which are so wealthy
that they pay

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.490 align:middle line:84%
for the elections
of the government.

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:51.060 align:middle line:84%
So whether you're a
Democrat or a Republican,

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:54.950 align:middle line:84%
these lobby groups have
poured money onto both sides

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:57.070 align:middle line:84%
so that whether one or
other gets into power,

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:58.685 align:middle line:84%
it's still the same
neoliberal agenda.

00:36:58.685 --> 00:36:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:03.399 align:middle line:84%
And you interviewed Bernard
Lietaer, as I recall.

00:37:03.399 --> 00:37:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about your
experience with him

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:06.148 align:middle line:90%
and what he had to say?

00:37:06.148 --> 00:37:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Because he's the
brilliant-- well,

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:10.640 align:middle line:84%
he was supposedly one of
the architects of the Euro.

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.870 align:middle line:84%
But he was also the
co-author of a book

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:14.290 align:middle line:90%
called "Money for a New World."

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And you really are in
alignment with this notion

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:18.940 align:middle line:84%
that the economy
itself-- and that's

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.590 align:middle line:84%
why you started
with food, we all

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:23.970 align:middle line:84%
need it-- really needs
to have a serious shakeup

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:24.730 align:middle line:90%
and realignment.

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:27.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you'll tell us a little
bit about your experience

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:28.293 align:middle line:90%
with Lietaer.

00:37:28.293 --> 00:37:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Well,
I believe that we

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:36.040 align:middle line:84%
have some very fundamental
problems on this planet

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:39.220 align:middle line:84%
if we are going to
sustain humans at all.

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:42.435 align:middle line:84%
So it's like-- if
you don't really

00:37:42.435 --> 00:37:46.530 align:middle line:84%
care about human beings carrying
on, then carry on as per usual.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:50.040 align:middle line:84%
But actually, if you do think
the world is very beautiful

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.970 align:middle line:84%
and you do think that people
are capable of changing

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and you do have children
and you want them to not

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:58.480 align:middle line:84%
be in total chaos
and starvation,

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.680 align:middle line:84%
then you have to start
informing yourself.

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And part of that is to look
at how an economic system that

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:12.230 align:middle line:84%
puts profit before the well
being of people and the planet,

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:13.880 align:middle line:90%
then we have a problem.

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.780 align:middle line:90%
And it's the growth economy.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:18.850 align:middle line:84%
So if you're constantly
looking at how each year

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:21.960 align:middle line:84%
your economy can
grow up to 3%, really

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.315 align:middle line:84%
that's all about how
much more we can dig out

00:38:25.315 --> 00:38:27.960 align:middle line:84%
of our resources,
out of our planet.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.480 align:middle line:90%
More oil, more minerals.

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.040 align:middle line:90%
So it's more mines.

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:37.760 align:middle line:84%
It's more for people to buy
more to fill their houses,

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.740 align:middle line:84%
to fill their lives, and
to put in the trash can.

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.670 align:middle line:90%
And really, we don't need that.

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:46.760 align:middle line:84%
We actually would be
perfectly well off with less.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:51.615 align:middle line:84%
We just are looking at, for
example, walking to work

00:38:51.615 --> 00:38:55.950 align:middle line:84%
or having a school which is near
or having shops which are near

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:59.340 align:middle line:84%
or food which is grown
in the hinterland, which

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:03.120 align:middle line:84%
is able to come to us in
a way that is sustainable.

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:06.370 align:middle line:84%
We do not need to go to
war with the Middle East

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:10.220 align:middle line:84%
to try and get that
constant flow of cheap oil.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.930 align:middle line:84%
So we are dictating
what their policies

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:16.310 align:middle line:84%
by putting dictators
into their countries.

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And consequently, you're
getting fundamentalist attitudes

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.930 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of that American
influence, which is very, very

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:26.580 align:middle line:84%
dangerous, both in
country and for us.

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.380 align:middle line:84%
So the more we bomb
those countries,

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:30.660 align:middle line:90%
we know it's about cheap oil.

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And the more we
bomb them, the more

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.210 align:middle line:84%
we'll get people over
here who want revenge.

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Because they've had
their family killed,

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:42.270 align:middle line:84%
tortured, raped by a system
that we are propping up

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:46.210 align:middle line:84%
with our money to get
constant cheap oil.

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:47.200 align:middle line:90%
We don't need that.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Constant
cheap everything.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: We need to
reduce our intake of energy,

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:51.830 align:middle line:90%
number one.

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And then we need
renewable energy.

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And then we need to look at a
more local system of farming,

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.460 align:middle line:90%
number one.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's our choice,
our shopping choices,

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:04.460 align:middle line:84%
because democracy
is not working.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Because the choice that you
have between-- in this country

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:09.810 align:middle line:84%
it's the Labor or Lib
Dem or the Conservatives.

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:12.560 align:middle line:84%
They're all bow-tying
to their pay masters.

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Whoever pays the
piper calls the tune.

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same in your
country with the Democrats

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:20.720 align:middle line:84%
and the Republicans and
the same in this country.

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.420 align:middle line:84%
We need to have a look
at a political system

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:25.844 align:middle line:84%
where what do we
really care about.

00:40:25.844 --> 00:40:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Are that any
politicians out there

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.300 align:middle line:84%
that are representing
what we believe

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:32.760 align:middle line:84%
is the right way to live a
happy life, a decent life?

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And that would be more
jobs on the ground,

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:39.370 align:middle line:84%
better pay in those jobs,
more local production

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:40.600 align:middle line:90%
for local consumption.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Surely, we should not be going
down this globalization where

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:46.110 align:middle line:84%
you've just got these
huge companies combing

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:51.000 align:middle line:84%
the globe for cheaper labor,
lower environmental standards,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.600 align:middle line:90%
poorer standards at work.

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:55.590 align:middle line:84%
You see the most horrendous
systems happening.

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:58.925 align:middle line:84%
Tortuous systems for both
animals and human beings all

00:40:58.925 --> 00:40:59.550 align:middle line:90%
over the world.

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:02.684 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you, the
environmental situation

00:41:02.684 --> 00:41:04.600 align:middle line:84%
is not going to get
better because there ain't

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:09.000 align:middle line:84%
any money in mending the
planet until we choose

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.660 align:middle line:84%
to buy in a way that is
conscious, informed shopping.

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:17.085 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed yesterday
when I met with you,

00:41:17.085 --> 00:41:19.670 align:middle line:84%
you pulled up with your
ponytail and your sweater

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.475 align:middle line:84%
and your dog behind
you on a bicycle.

00:41:21.475 --> 00:41:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Is this is how you personally
travel around London

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:25.415 align:middle line:90%
quite a bit?

00:41:25.415 --> 00:41:26.697 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Well, I don't--

00:41:26.697 --> 00:41:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it was
a sunny day, for one.

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:29.610 align:middle line:90%
Today it wouldn't be so fun.

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Well, excuse me.

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:32.950 align:middle line:84%
When we left, do you remember
it was like, oh, my God.

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:33.402 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It did.

00:41:33.402 --> 00:41:34.470 align:middle line:90%
It had started raining, yes.

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:36.053 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Oh,
here come the clouds.

00:41:36.053 --> 00:41:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Here comes the rain.

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:38.450 align:middle line:90%
But I am English.

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:39.980 align:middle line:90%
So I'm used to the rain.

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And I spent the whole of
the afternoon with my banner

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.280 align:middle line:90%
at the anti-war march.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.730 align:middle line:90%
So I actually love a bicycle.

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:49.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm old enough
that when I went to Beijing,

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:53.950 align:middle line:90%
70% of the traffic was bicycles.

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was beautiful
and people were smiling

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:59.550 align:middle line:84%
and they were having good
exercise and the air was pure.

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:03.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm on my bicycle,
the air is disgusting.

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:03.735 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:03.735 --> 00:42:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: You should see my
mask and my hat and my jacket.

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Trying to sort
of say, hello, I'm here.

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:10.360 align:middle line:90%
Don't squash me, please.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.647 align:middle line:84%
But it is fun because
it's fresh air.

00:42:12.647 --> 00:42:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And how many of us are looking
at a screen all day long?

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:18.426 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so your family
has access to great wealth.

00:42:18.426 --> 00:42:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And now what about
your children?

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.380 align:middle line:90%
What have you passed on to them?

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.859 align:middle line:84%
And what you say-- I
mean, how does that work?

00:42:23.859 --> 00:42:25.400 align:middle line:84%
As you said in the
beginning, there's

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:28.850 align:middle line:84%
this huge equity
between, still, families

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:31.655 align:middle line:84%
with wealth,
individuals with wealth.

00:42:31.655 --> 00:42:33.780 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what part
of the world you're in.

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And then the underclasses
and making sure

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:38.160 align:middle line:84%
that they can have a
quality of life, too.

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.860 align:middle line:84%
A decent, dignified
quality of life.

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's
economy of scale.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.460 align:middle line:84%
It's never all going
to be the same.

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:45.950 align:middle line:90%
But how do we address that?

00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:47.393 align:middle line:90%
How do you address that?

00:42:47.393 --> 00:42:50.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: I think that's one
of the most important issues

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.140 align:middle line:90%
of our time.

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:55.860 align:middle line:84%
That is, that the wealthy
are getting wealthier.

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:58.140 align:middle line:84%
The number of them
is getting smaller,

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:00.440 align:middle line:84%
but they're getting
wealthier and wealthier.

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.730 align:middle line:90%
And forget the middle class.

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:05.860 align:middle line:84%
You're going down to people
losing their middle class

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:07.650 align:middle line:84%
status and going to
working to class.

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:08.880 align:middle line:90%
Or not even.

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.481 align:middle line:90%
I think most of are slaves.

00:43:10.481 --> 00:43:10.980 align:middle line:90%
Simply.

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Actually, for me a
mortgage is like slavery.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: I went
to the dentist once,

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:17.350 align:middle line:90%
and the receptionist was crying.

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:18.790 align:middle line:90%
And I asked her what was wrong.

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And she said she just had
to take her 16 week old baby

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.900 align:middle line:84%
to a nursery because
she had to go back

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:30.170 align:middle line:84%
to work to pay the 70,000
pound mortgage that they had

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:34.160 align:middle line:84%
on their two bedroom flat
in the suburb of Bristol.

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Now mortgages are a way that
banks can make uber money out

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:41.290 align:middle line:84%
of us buying the most expensive
investment of our life.

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:45.290 align:middle line:84%
But we're paying that
mortgage back all our life.

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:46.230 align:middle line:90%
That's wrong.

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:49.850 align:middle line:84%
If we lose our job for
a couple of months,

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:54.090 align:middle line:84%
that interest on that money
becomes bigger and bigger.

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:55.650 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes intolerable.

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And actually, we should
look at a system which

00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:03.270 align:middle line:84%
is allowing people to
earn a decent living,

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:08.140 align:middle line:84%
to get on to the house ladder
or to rent but to feel secure.

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:10.560 align:middle line:90%
Their money's not just going.

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:13.840 align:middle line:84%
People like-- particularly in
this country--to own their own

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:14.840 align:middle line:90%
house.

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.520 align:middle line:90%
Build your own house.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Don't have land that's
so uber expensive.

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:20.642 align:middle line:84%
Build houses so
that people can live

00:44:20.642 --> 00:44:22.455 align:middle line:90%
in communities around gardens.

00:44:22.455 --> 00:44:24.670 align:middle line:90%
Grow your own food.

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Take back control
of your own life.

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What if
they have nothing?

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:30.370 align:middle line:84%
If they have so
little to begin with?

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Which a lot of people are in
that position now all over.

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And then the younger
generations, in particular.

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:37.270 align:middle line:90%
How does that happen?

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not suggesting there is
a redistribution of wealth that

00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:44.760 align:middle line:90%
is dictated.

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying how does
this naturally occur,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.310 align:middle line:84%
where there's great wealth
filtering into the system

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:53.750 align:middle line:84%
to help lift up
those who don't have

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:56.946 align:middle line:84%
that ability or
that opportunity?

00:44:56.946 --> 00:44:58.395 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Well,
I think that we

00:44:58.395 --> 00:45:04.410 align:middle line:84%
need to have a serious tax
system that ensures that people

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:10.530 align:middle line:84%
don't hide their money abroad
and that the wealthy are taxed

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:14.320 align:middle line:84%
in a way which will
level the playing field.

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Because it's absurd
that sometimes

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.200 align:middle line:84%
people can't afford-- even
if they have a full time

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.940 align:middle line:90%
job-- to feed their family.

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:21.675 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:45:21.675 --> 00:45:23.133 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: And
I know in America,

00:45:23.133 --> 00:45:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Wal-Mart pays so badly that
people have to get food stamps

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:27.032 align:middle line:90%
to afford to pay their--

00:45:27.032 --> 00:45:28.115 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Their employees.

00:45:28.115 --> 00:45:28.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: So it's just absurd
that these huge businesses

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:34.575 align:middle line:90%
are dictating the rules of game.

00:45:34.575 --> 00:45:36.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe our governments
are going to do anything.

00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:39.010 align:middle line:84%
This democratic
system doesn't work.

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:40.530 align:middle line:90%
It's up to us.

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:42.200 align:middle line:90%
We need to take back control.

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:45.050 align:middle line:84%
We need to demand
the type of food

00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and the type of
pay that is fair.

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:51.610 align:middle line:84%
We need to revitalize our
unions to represent us.

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:52.660 align:middle line:90%
Join the union.

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.660 align:middle line:90%
Because it's all been broken.

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the rules
protecting our health

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:57.330 align:middle line:90%
have been broken.

00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's a terrifying new
treaty which is coming out.

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:04.487 align:middle line:84%
Admittedly, there are about
5,000 treaties already,

00:46:04.487 --> 00:46:06.570 align:middle line:84%
which are all about trade
between nations, which--

00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's the new one?

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: It's called
the Transatlantic Trade

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:12.880 align:middle line:90%
and Investment Partnership.

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:13.820 align:middle line:90%
TTIP it's called.

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's about harmonizing
trade between the US and Europe.

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, the US
regulations are so bad.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:28.030 align:middle line:84%
They've been rolled back so low
by the power of big business.

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And Europe actually
has got a few laws

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:31.838 align:middle line:90%
that protect our health.

00:46:31.838 --> 00:46:32.463 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:46:32.463 --> 00:46:32.490 align:middle line:90%
A few.

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:34.614 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: For example,
we have the Precautionary

00:46:34.614 --> 00:46:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Principle where
you have to prove

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.940 align:middle line:90%
that your chemical is safe.

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in America,
you have to prove

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.681 align:middle line:90%
that that chemical is not safe.

00:46:42.681 --> 00:46:43.180 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.449 align:middle line:84%
So they will bring
the chemical out

00:46:45.449 --> 00:46:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and you had to prove
it's not for it to go.

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.404 align:middle line:84%
And that is
impossible, virtually,

00:46:49.404 --> 00:46:50.820 align:middle line:84%
to prove that it's
not because you

00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:53.070 align:middle line:84%
have to get so many
people to come up

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:54.820 align:middle line:84%
and the tests have
to warn that it

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:58.510 align:middle line:84%
came from that product and
nothing else in their life.

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:03.240 align:middle line:84%
So basically we're living in a
system which is so influenced

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.390 align:middle line:84%
by money and our
politicians are completely

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:08.860 align:middle line:90%
bought out by this system.

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:10.435 align:middle line:84%
Because there isn't
a party, really,

00:47:10.435 --> 00:47:13.550 align:middle line:84%
that they can represent that
isn't bought out by the system.

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Because the campaign
needs the money.

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:17.229 align:middle line:84%
So if you have the
Green Party, it's

00:47:17.229 --> 00:47:19.270 align:middle line:84%
not going to get any
corporate money because it's

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:21.125 align:middle line:84%
saying corporations
must be accountable,

00:47:21.125 --> 00:47:22.110 align:middle line:90%
it must be broken out.

00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:23.568 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It didn't
work in the US.

00:47:23.568 --> 00:47:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: No.

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:27.260 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
actually, I think,

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:30.760 align:middle line:84%
revolutionize the economy
by taking back control.

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is through
the way you bank,

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:35.410 align:middle line:84%
through the way you
use your currencies.

00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:37.990 align:middle line:84%
So there are currencies in
this country called the Bristol

00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:40.807 align:middle line:84%
pound, the Totnes
pound, the Lewes pound.

00:47:40.807 --> 00:47:41.890 align:middle line:90%
And these are rolling out.

00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Local currencies.

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:43.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Yeah.

00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.821 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of countries like--
we were talking about Argentina

00:47:46.821 --> 00:47:48.640 align:middle line:84%
when it had it's
complete economic crisis.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.470 align:middle line:84%
The way that it got
itself out of trouble

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:52.880 align:middle line:84%
was people actually invented
their own currencies

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:56.740 align:middle line:84%
as a medium of exchange
which was fair.

00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:03.110 align:middle line:84%
At the moment the money system
is so slanted for big business

00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:07.340 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get as much money
as it wants to grow bigger.

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:10.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not only subsidies,
direct subsidies,

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:14.300 align:middle line:84%
but it's research and
development subsidies.

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Everything is geared
to big business

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:20.490 align:middle line:84%
to be able to compete
globally instead of helping

00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:24.410 align:middle line:84%
the small, the local, the
people to take control

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:28.490 align:middle line:84%
over their own land to grow
food for themselves first,

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:30.640 align:middle line:90%
their family, their community.

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And then they should
have a diversity

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:34.140 align:middle line:84%
of people who are
prepared to buy it--

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:37.310 align:middle line:84%
small shops-- so that they
can go to a different person

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:39.242 align:middle line:84%
if they're not
getting enough money.

00:48:39.242 --> 00:48:40.700 align:middle line:84%
But at the moment,
the supermarkets

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:45.155 align:middle line:84%
just pay virtually for milk,
for example, the same as water.

00:48:45.155 --> 00:48:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:47.610 align:middle line:90%
It's heavily subsidized, too.

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Yeah.

00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
another whole issue

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:51.366 align:middle line:84%
we don't need to go
into because we know

00:48:51.366 --> 00:48:53.010 align:middle line:84%
about the subsidies
in both countries,

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:54.800 align:middle line:84%
where the small farmer
is not subsidized.

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.970 align:middle line:90%
If he goes belly up, who cares?

00:48:56.970 --> 00:48:58.356 align:middle line:90%
Except his kids, right?

00:48:58.356 --> 00:48:59.106 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Yeah.

00:48:59.106 --> 00:49:01.800 align:middle line:84%
So we need a sort of
people power revolution

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:03.160 align:middle line:90%
that we're all a part of.

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.701 align:middle line:84%
We're all aware that
the corporations

00:49:04.701 --> 00:49:05.990 align:middle line:90%
are far too powerful.

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And the information
is on the internet.

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And for me, start by
signing the pig pledge

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:14.847 align:middle line:84%
to say that you will
not eat any meat that

00:49:14.847 --> 00:49:15.930 align:middle line:90%
comes from a factory farm.

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, if they
watch your documentary, then

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:20.340 align:middle line:84%
I think most people will be
very comfortable with signing

00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:20.966 align:middle line:90%
the pig pledge.

00:49:20.966 --> 00:49:21.715 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Yeah.

00:49:21.715 --> 00:49:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also
just to go back

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:25.590 align:middle line:84%
to Prince Charles for a moment,
because I greatly respect

00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:27.840 align:middle line:84%
his work, his book
called "Harmony," which

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:31.680 align:middle line:84%
I was shocked to find
out not one person

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:34.570 align:middle line:84%
that I know in Britain
had even heard of.

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Now talk about
silencing a message.

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:40.240 align:middle line:84%
We think of Prince Charles in
the community, the conspiracy

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:45.320 align:middle line:84%
community, as almost--
well, one of the elite.

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And so that has a
different meaning

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:49.360 align:middle line:84%
in the conspiracy
community, of course.

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:52.140 align:middle line:84%
But then I read the book
"Harmony," and I thought,

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.910 align:middle line:84%
isn't it interesting
the nature of a person

00:49:54.910 --> 00:50:00.590 align:middle line:84%
who seems to be so disliked from
both sides can't be all bad.

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:02.606 align:middle line:84%
I mean, his message
in the book is

00:50:02.606 --> 00:50:04.855 align:middle line:84%
very much along the line of
what you're talking about.

00:50:04.855 --> 00:50:06.570 align:middle line:90%
A beautifully written book.

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, I guess I'm asking in
a roundabout way, what is this?

00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:14.670 align:middle line:84%
What kind of person-- is he for,
to begin with, that both sides?

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Well, I actually
think the public love Prince

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Charles.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:19.500 align:middle line:90%
Really--

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I never
hear anyone say that.

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Real
respect for him.

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:25.470 align:middle line:84%
But don't forget that
the media in Britain

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:28.835 align:middle line:84%
is owned by the
elite, the corporate--

00:50:28.835 --> 00:50:31.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they're
certainly axing him out

00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:32.310 align:middle line:90%
of the program.

00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:33.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Exactly.

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:36.052 align:middle line:84%
So-- and also, he's
not selling anything.

00:50:36.052 --> 00:50:37.760 align:middle line:84%
So you're not really
going to get anybody

00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.510 align:middle line:84%
to promote his work
to sell their goods.

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:44.970 align:middle line:84%
He's just giving a message,
which is truly benign,

00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:47.770 align:middle line:84%
and he is loved by
the Green Movement.

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I would guess.

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:49.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:49.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:51.424 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: He
is a huge godsend.

00:50:51.424 --> 00:50:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just
shocked that no one, even

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:54.910 align:middle line:90%
people who read a lot.

00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:57.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my very literate
friends in Britain

00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:58.660 align:middle line:90%
had never heard of his book.

00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Rupert Sheldrake's the
one that told me about it.

00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:03.430 align:middle line:84%
He said, Regina, did you know
Prince Charles wrote a book?

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Because he was
saying, you really

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:06.013 align:middle line:90%
should interview Prince Charles.

00:51:06.013 --> 00:51:08.485 align:middle line:84%
He said, did you know he
wrote a book called "Harmony?"

00:51:08.485 --> 00:51:08.780 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:11.279 align:middle line:84%
So I started asking all my more
literate friends in Britain.

00:51:11.279 --> 00:51:12.290 align:middle line:90%
No one had heard of it.

00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:17.180 align:middle line:84%
He got no air time, no
newspaper time, no interviews,

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:18.240 align:middle line:90%
no excerpts.

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.240 align:middle line:84%
It's as though he
hadn't done a thing.

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: Yeah.

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:24.470 align:middle line:84%
I think that he does challenge
the status quo thinking

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:28.300 align:middle line:84%
of growth and
expanding our markets

00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:33.160 align:middle line:84%
and buying new highly processed
very, very cheap-- maybe

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:37.530 align:middle line:84%
they think that he's
appealing to an elite idealist

00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:38.550 align:middle line:90%
way of living.

00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, as far
as I'm concerned,

00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:43.409 align:middle line:90%
unless you look at an ideal--

00:51:43.409 --> 00:51:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's wholesome.

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: --you are
actually compromising

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:48.840 align:middle line:84%
to go along with
the system, which

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:51.048 align:middle line:84%
is going to see the end the
human race on the planet.

00:51:51.048 --> 00:51:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what happens
if he ends up taking power?

00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Will his voice ever
be heard do you think?

00:51:56.070 --> 00:51:57.720 align:middle line:84%
I know everybody--
we see the articles

00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:00.446 align:middle line:84%
in our People Magazines,
too, over there.

00:52:00.446 --> 00:52:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Well, I mean
hopefully when he becomes king,

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:04.862 align:middle line:84%
then everybody will say,
hey, look what he wrote.

00:52:04.862 --> 00:52:06.278 align:middle line:84%
Look what he's--
he's a great man.

00:52:06.278 --> 00:52:06.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: He is a hero.

00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:11.180 align:middle line:90%
He's a Mahatma Gandhi and, ah.

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:14.740 align:middle line:84%
We're so lucky to have him
because he does endorse

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:19.280 align:middle line:84%
a lot of what people who
would be dismissed as not

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:22.410 align:middle line:84%
practical because he is
advocating a way of eating

00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:25.010 align:middle line:84%
which is on your
supermarket shelf,

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:28.860 align:middle line:84%
but you need to be informed of
why you need to choose that.

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And the supermarkets
are very, very bad

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.840 align:middle line:84%
for the image of
organic and alternative

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:37.256 align:middle line:84%
because they up the price
hugely, disproportionately.

00:52:37.256 --> 00:52:40.380 align:middle line:84%
If you go to your farmers market
or you buy through the internet

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:43.510 align:middle line:84%
or you get an able and
call box delivered,

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:45.540 align:middle line:84%
the prices are much
more reasonable.

00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And also, for pork for
example, not only can you

00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:51.220 align:middle line:84%
reduce your meat
intake, but you could

00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:54.890 align:middle line:84%
buy the less popular cuts,
which are much cheaper.

00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you'd still
have the diet that you like.

00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:59.200 align:middle line:90%
And it's delicious.

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.960 align:middle line:84%
It's just not what's
advertised on the telly.

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:02.952 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:02.952 --> 00:53:04.410 align:middle line:84%
We only have a
couple minutes left.

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:05.935 align:middle line:90%
Any final thoughts?

00:53:05.935 --> 00:53:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: Well, I
would the pig pledge

00:53:08.970 --> 00:53:11.160 align:middle line:90%
to roll out globally.

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And therefore people to take
back control of their food

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:18.590 align:middle line:84%
economy and say, I'm not
going to buy from a factory.

00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:21.452 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually going to
buy from somewhere where

00:53:21.452 --> 00:53:23.410 align:middle line:84%
the animal's been looked
after, the money stays

00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:26.760 align:middle line:84%
in the locality, there
is no external pollution

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:29.260 align:middle line:84%
to people's health or
to the environment,

00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:31.030 align:middle line:90%
to the water system.

00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
that I want to protect

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:35.179 align:middle line:84%
my planet for my
children to inherit.

00:53:35.179 --> 00:53:35.845 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mmhmm.

00:53:35.845 --> 00:53:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Just one simple
decision at a time.

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
that awareness,

00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:42.410 align:middle line:84%
generally when people start
searching on the internet,

00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:45.070 align:middle line:84%
that awareness will lead to
another area of awareness,

00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:47.990 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the dairy
industry or whether it's

00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Monsanto and genetically
modified seeds and so forth.

00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:53.410 align:middle line:84%
It takes you from
one to the other.

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:55.450 align:middle line:84%
So that's a really good
starting place, again

00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:56.990 align:middle line:90%
because of the emotions of it.

00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to say,
I initially became

00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:02.550 align:middle line:84%
aware of what you're doing
through a mutual acquaintance

00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:05.970 align:middle line:84%
of ours, James Martinez, who
has to do with cold fusion.

00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:07.342 align:middle line:90%
And that's his area of interest.

00:54:07.342 --> 00:54:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Are there some
other areas that you

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:12.490 align:middle line:84%
might be moving into having
to do with public awareness

00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:14.380 align:middle line:90%
after pigs?

00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:17.070 align:middle line:10%
>>WORCESTER: Well, I think
that I would probably

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:25.240 align:middle line:10%
stay with food because food is
our number one need three times

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:26.050 align:middle line:10%
a day.

00:54:26.050 --> 00:54:30.300 align:middle line:10%
And if we don't get the word
food sovereignty where you take

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:33.780 align:middle line:10%
back control and you make
sure that that food is grown

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:37.510 align:middle line:10%
as close to home as possible by
the skills of people who farm

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:41.239 align:middle line:10%
for years-- you cannot pick
up these skills like that.

00:54:41.239 --> 00:54:41.905 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:41.905 --> 00:54:42.466 align:middle line:90%
It's multi-generational.

00:54:42.466 --> 00:54:42.966 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:54:42.966 --> 00:54:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: So I think
that probably fighting

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:48.110 align:middle line:84%
for local food is
going to see me out.

00:54:48.110 --> 00:54:52.360 align:middle line:84%
But I obviously also
want local energy,

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:55.550 align:middle line:84%
local currencies,
local everything.

00:54:55.550 --> 00:54:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And do your children
live this way as well?

00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:00.340 align:middle line:90%
Having been raised by you?

00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:03.410 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times our kids rebel
and do the exact opposite thing

00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:05.020 align:middle line:90%
their parents are about.

00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: I tell you, my
kids are still quite young.

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:10.220 align:middle line:90%
They are 19, 23, and 26.

00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And they're just
finding their way.

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And as far as I'm concerned,
I want them to be happy first.

00:55:15.490 --> 00:55:18.390 align:middle line:84%
I want them to find
what they're good at.

00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
kind of really

00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:24.030 align:middle line:84%
start thinking who they are,
what the world needs, what they

00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:26.910 align:middle line:84%
want to feel that
they're respected about,

00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:29.720 align:middle line:84%
they might think, I could
do a little bit more

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:33.390 align:middle line:84%
from my past education
from Mom to give back

00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:36.170 align:middle line:84%
and to make sure that the planet
is safe place for my kids.

00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
you're a good mom.

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:42.030 align:middle line:84%
That's-- making sure your child
is happy first is number one.

00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you
so much for your time

00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:46.640 align:middle line:84%
and taking the time to
go out on your bicycle

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:49.320 align:middle line:84%
with your little dog and meet
with me prior to this interview

00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:51.905 align:middle line:84%
so I could get to know you
a little bit better as well.

00:55:51.905 --> 00:55:53.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WORCESTER: My pleasure.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.740 align:middle line:84%
It was very nice to see
you before, actually.

00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:57.402 align:middle line:90%
Sort of feel we're friends.

00:55:57.402 --> 00:55:58.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We knew right away.

00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:00.485 align:middle line:84%
>>WORCESTER: We had
so much in common.

00:56:00.485 --> 00:56:01.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:04.460 align:middle line:90%
