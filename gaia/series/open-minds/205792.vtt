00:00:09.035 --> 00:00:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>>DANIEL SHEEHAN: It
made it clear that there

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.470 align:middle line:90%
was something going on.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.070 align:middle line:84%
There was an uptick in the
appearance of the UFOs.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.470 align:middle line:84%
This needed to be shared
with the people of the world,

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.040 align:middle line:84%
because this was an
extraordinary phenomenon going

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.840 align:middle line:90%
on here.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.880 align:middle line:84%
We have to start preparing
for an ever increasing event.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.190 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed
people who profess

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.830 align:middle line:84%
quite credibly to have
actually been present when

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.590 align:middle line:90%
an ET was being interviewed.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.340 align:middle line:84%
These are two of the
most important events

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.900 align:middle line:84%
that have ever happened
in the entire history

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.890 align:middle line:90%
of our human family.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Yes.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And they don't
appear to be unrelated.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.728 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: We have to develop
a new paradigm human worldview.

00:00:43.728 --> 00:00:48.757 align:middle line:90%


00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:51.090 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: I'm betting there's
not a person among you who

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.210 align:middle line:10%
hasn't heard about the recent
events regarding disclosure

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.030 align:middle line:10%
of the existence of
unidentified flying objects,

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.900 align:middle line:10%
now called unidentified
aerial phenomena.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of the old
players woven together

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.700 align:middle line:84%
with some new in a variety
of governmental and military

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.560 align:middle line:84%
agencies with the
intent to finally

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.200 align:middle line:84%
inform the public of
the presence of visitors

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.670 align:middle line:84%
and their technology
to our planet.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.470 align:middle line:90%
Yikes.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, Danny Sheehan, I'm so
happy you're here with us.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Because you're counsel for
the people that were involved,

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.770 align:middle line:84%
that were behind this and really
stimulated this disclosure

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.100 align:middle line:84%
from the Pentagon, you know
more about the nuts and bolts

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.570 align:middle line:90%
underneath it than anybody.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so grateful
to have you back.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Besides, we haven't had
a chance to sit together

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.290 align:middle line:90%
for a couple of years.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.330 align:middle line:90%
So welcome.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.455 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: I appreciate it.

00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I want to just
start with a couple of things.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.200 align:middle line:84%
First of all, why did they
change it from UFO to UAP?

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.718 align:middle line:90%
I mean, is that--

00:01:42.718 --> 00:01:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: The they
that's involved--

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, the they.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.783 align:middle line:10%
>>SHEEHAN: The they that's
involved is the United States

00:01:47.783 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:10%
Defense Department.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.970 align:middle line:10%
And what they've
been trying to do

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.160 align:middle line:10%
is try to get away from all
of the information about UFOs

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.630 align:middle line:10%
that are so closely connected
to extraterrestrial visitations.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.510 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
sever that connection.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.050 align:middle line:84%
Because there was an element
in the Defense Department

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.640 align:middle line:84%
that has been focusing
since at least July of 1947

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.440 align:middle line:84%
with the Roswell
crash, is trying

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.490 align:middle line:84%
to concentrate on the technology
of the vehicles themselves

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.300 align:middle line:84%
to transform them into
weapons systems for us.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.750 align:middle line:84%
So there's been this momentum
inside the Defense Department

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.260 align:middle line:84%
to focus on the mechanics
of the whole thing,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.830 align:middle line:84%
to get at the technology to try
to develop it into a weapons

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.010 align:middle line:84%
system so they could use it
to the advantage of the United

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.160 align:middle line:84%
States and the western
allies in the Cold War.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And so all of that
was operational up

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.240 align:middle line:84%
until December 31, of 1991, when
the Soviet Union voluntarily

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.000 align:middle line:90%
dissolved with Gorbachev.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And so they've
been really trying

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.700 align:middle line:84%
to figure out since that time,
all of western civilization

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.550 align:middle line:84%
has been basically trying to
figure out from that time, how

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:90%
to get reoriented.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And so what's happened
is the Defense Department

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.230 align:middle line:84%
itself was trying to figure
out how to reorient itself

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.320 align:middle line:84%
from this major confrontation
with the Soviet Union.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, into trying to deal with
one of the early writings

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.680 align:middle line:84%
that took place right at
the end of the Cold War,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.590 align:middle line:84%
and that was with
Samuel P. Huntington.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Samuel P. Huntington wrote a
major article in the "Foreign

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Affairs" magazine,
which is the publication

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:84%
of the Council on
Foreign Relations,

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.080 align:middle line:84%
saying that we had to
reorient ourself now,

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.260 align:middle line:84%
that the Cold War
with Russia was over,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.320 align:middle line:84%
and start to prepare for
an ongoing confrontation

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.500 align:middle line:84%
with China, the new
rising Asian empire.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, and so
what does UAP or UFO, how

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.315 align:middle line:90%
does that fall into it?

00:03:41.315 --> 00:03:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well,
what this did is

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.640 align:middle line:84%
it generated a whole flux
inside the Defense Department.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happened, in the
midst of that process going on,

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Senator Harry Reid sort of in
preparing for his departure

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.870 align:middle line:84%
as the Majority Leader of
the United States Senate

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.170 align:middle line:84%
in the Democratic party
managed, along with Senator

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Inouye from Hawaii and
Senator Stevens from Texas,

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:11.520 align:middle line:84%
to get this bill passed, a piece
of budget to put $22 million

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.920 align:middle line:90%
into the Defense Department.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.637 align:middle line:84%
Now, to try to bring up
to date the UFO issue, OK.

00:04:18.637 --> 00:04:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now, What.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.399 align:middle line:90%
Was their motivation?

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:21.709 align:middle line:90%
Because you kind of know more.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well,
their motivation

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.010 align:middle line:84%
is because they believe that
we have to start preparing

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.170 align:middle line:90%
for an ever increasing event.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.070 align:middle line:84%
They became aware of
the fact that UFOs

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.130 align:middle line:84%
were starting to present
themselves much more regularly

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.637 align:middle line:84%
now, much more
conspicuously now.

00:04:40.637 --> 00:04:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Including in China and
Russia and the United States.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Oh, everywhere,
and our intelligence

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.220 align:middle line:90%
was revealing that.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So it made
it clear that there

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.430 align:middle line:90%
was something going on.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.700 align:middle line:84%
There was an uptick,
a substantial uptick

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.610 align:middle line:90%
in the appearance of the UFOs.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And they were now being able
to be picked up by much more

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.570 align:middle line:90%
sophisticated radar.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.940 align:middle line:84%
We had developed an
entire other technology

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.530 align:middle line:84%
that people don't
know about now.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.350 align:middle line:84%
But the Central
Intelligence Agency

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.310 align:middle line:84%
has set up a thing called the
Electromagnetic Intelligence

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Center, so that
they were developing

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.490 align:middle line:84%
different forms of
electromagnetic discernment

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.350 align:middle line:84%
equipment that was able to track
the electromagnetic signatures

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.760 align:middle line:84%
of vehicles, not just radar that
bounce off of them, et cetera.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And they were picking
up a lot of these UFOs

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.890 align:middle line:90%
with that new technology.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And so the feedback was
coming back into another group

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.180 align:middle line:90%
that you never heard about.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who?

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.072 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: The Geospatial
Intelligence Center.

00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're right, I've
never heard of this one.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.572 align:middle line:90%
Geospatial Intelligence Center.

00:05:42.572 --> 00:05:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Geospatial
Intelligence Center,

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.460 align:middle line:84%
which is another major
group that actually houses

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.020 align:middle line:90%
the information about Roswell.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.510 align:middle line:84%
What they were attempting
to do in trying

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.800 align:middle line:84%
to readjust inside the Defense
Department to the new situation

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.860 align:middle line:84%
that they were in, they started
to take a look at the UFO issue

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.233 align:middle line:84%
as well to say, what
should we do about this?

00:06:02.233 --> 00:06:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And so what they
did is they said,

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.775 align:middle line:84%
we're going to start
calling-- we're going to first

00:06:05.775 --> 00:06:08.800 align:middle line:84%
have this major secret
program inside the Pentagon,

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.940 align:middle line:84%
called the-- and they snuck it
in under the weapons program

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:13.960 align:middle line:90%
planning.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.150 align:middle line:84%
It was originally
came in as a funding

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.720 align:middle line:84%
to the strategic
weapons analysis.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what gave it
this kind of special focus

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.400 align:middle line:90%
on how fast do they go?

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.050 align:middle line:90%
What are their capabilities?

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.010 align:middle line:84%
How can they make these 90
degree turns at 43,000 miles

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.080 align:middle line:90%
an hour inside our atmosphere?

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.380 align:middle line:84%
How can they pull 600
gs all that stuff.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.190 align:middle line:84%
And so they brought it
in and they said, look,

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.200 align:middle line:84%
we're not going
to call them UFOs.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Because if we talk
about these as UFOs

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.480 align:middle line:84%
it's going to bring in
all the baggage of all

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.880 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrial
issues, all the people who

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.537 align:middle line:84%
say I've seen the
flying saucers,

00:06:50.537 --> 00:06:52.120 align:middle line:84%
I've seen the beings
come out of them.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.310 align:middle line:84%
I've had-- all the way back
to Betty and Barney Hill.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:54.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.253 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That whole
other dimension.

00:06:56.253 --> 00:06:58.450 align:middle line:84%
They want to get away
from that, and they

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.250 align:middle line:84%
want to focus just
on the equipment

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.860 align:middle line:84%
itself under the
weapons program.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:84%
So that's how Lue
Elizondo got brought

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.350 align:middle line:90%
in to this back in 2007.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now
we need to establish

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.450 align:middle line:84%
for everyone who
Lue Elizondo is, how

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.190 align:middle line:90%
you became involved with him.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Who Christopher Mellon is, how
you became involved with him.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.130 align:middle line:10%
>>SHEEHAN: Lue Elizondo
is a long time career

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.710 align:middle line:10%
military
counterintelligence officer.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.240 align:middle line:10%
He's the child of Cuban-American
refugees, fled from Cuba back

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.630 align:middle line:10%
in 1959 when Castro took over.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.870 align:middle line:84%
He was raised in that whole
element of the alpha 66

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:40.810 align:middle line:84%
in the 2506 brigade, all of
those hardcore anti-communist

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:41.840 align:middle line:90%
groups.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And so he rose up inside
the military as a bona fide

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle line:90%
counterintelligence officer.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.970 align:middle line:84%
He ended up being brought in
to this special program that

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.210 align:middle line:84%
had been funded by the
special appropriations that

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:56.980 align:middle line:84%
was sponsored by
the three senators.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And he was brought in
originally as a security officer

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:04.185 align:middle line:84%
to maintain the secrecy
of that project,

00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:05.560 align:middle line:84%
because they were
extraordinarily

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.280 align:middle line:84%
sensitive about this being found
out that they were doing this.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And so he was, for
the first two years,

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.450 align:middle line:84%
he was the chief
security officer.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And then he was made
the executive director

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.870 align:middle line:90%
of the whole program.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.560 align:middle line:84%
So his responsibility
shifted from just protecting

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.840 align:middle line:84%
the secrecy of this
program into working

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.803 align:middle line:90%
on the substance of the program.

00:08:24.803 --> 00:08:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What gave
him unique knowledge

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.330 align:middle line:84%
to have put him
in that capacity?

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: It wasn't clear.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.220 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't clear as to why he
was made the executive director

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.919 align:middle line:84%
of it, other than the fact
that he was viewed as extremely

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:40.690 align:middle line:84%
loyal, extremely cognizant of
maintaining secrecy about this.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.909 align:middle line:84%
They trusted him, and
they knew that this

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:45.710 align:middle line:84%
was fraught with
potential exposure.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And so he had a
primary commitment

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.960 align:middle line:90%
to the secrecy of this.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.520 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
is that he started

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.000 align:middle line:84%
discovering when he got into
the executive director position

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.160 align:middle line:90%
that he was being blocked.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.840 align:middle line:90%
He's a true believer.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.470 align:middle line:84%
When he's given an
assignment, he does it.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:07.480 align:middle line:84%
When he was tasked with finding
out about these UAPs, UFOs,

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.390 align:middle line:84%
he did it and started
going after this.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.410 align:middle line:84%
So there were all
kinds of doors that

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.480 align:middle line:84%
were being closed
in his face When

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.170 align:middle line:84%
he would try to get the
information he couldn't get it.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.690 align:middle line:84%
He would go to a major
officers, general officers

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:20.800 align:middle line:90%
in the different services.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is this kind of a
reflection back to Project Blue

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Book where Hynek is tasked with
trying to investigate, only

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.770 align:middle line:84%
to have doors
slammed in his face

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.645 align:middle line:84%
when he found there was
something real to it?

00:09:31.645 --> 00:09:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, yes,
yes, very much so.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And this was sort
of a replay of that.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:35.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: It's the next
generation of that whole Blue

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.280 align:middle line:90%
Book thing.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And so Lue became more and
more frustrated about that,

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:84%
and was pushing back against
it all within the rules, all

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.810 align:middle line:84%
within the security
clearances, trying

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.390 align:middle line:84%
to open up those doors
to find out really

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.020 align:middle line:90%
what's going on here.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Not only how fast do they fly
and how can they pull 600 gs,

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and how can we possibly develop
this into a weapon system.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:01.000 align:middle line:84%
He was curious about
well, whose are these?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And so he probed into this
thing to find out whether or not

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.858 align:middle line:84%
we had really developed
these technologies

00:10:07.858 --> 00:10:09.400 align:middle line:84%
through the back
engineering efforts.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.160 align:middle line:90%
Did we have--

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.993 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Through more
of our shadow monies.

00:10:11.993 --> 00:10:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: The
whole black budget.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, exactly, yeah.

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Trying to find
out whether we actually

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.577 align:middle line:84%
had any of these craft, whether
they were really recovered

00:10:17.577 --> 00:10:20.193 align:middle line:84%
or not, that was
all terribly secret.

00:10:20.193 --> 00:10:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And he said, look,
if I'm supposed

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:24.160 align:middle line:84%
to be investigating
these things,

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.870 align:middle line:84%
and you're not even
revealing to me

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.080 align:middle line:84%
whether we have any of these
things, that's ridiculous.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:29.890 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And he came to realize
that what had happened

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:35.540 align:middle line:84%
is that the National Security
State Bureaucracy had

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.940 align:middle line:84%
sort of locked down
against these senators who

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.020 align:middle line:90%
are the government.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Who said, look, we want to
have a genuine investigation

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.260 align:middle line:90%
of what this is all about.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, they viewed that as
just sort of a brain flick

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.610 align:middle line:90%
of a couple of few senators.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:54.095 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And so that they
locked down against it,

00:10:54.095 --> 00:10:56.950 align:middle line:84%
and they included Lue and
this whole project in that.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:58.580 align:middle line:90%
So they weren't getting access.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.550 align:middle line:84%
So what Lue ended up
doing is while trying

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.130 align:middle line:84%
to get more and more
of this information,

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.810 align:middle line:84%
he was in very
close communications

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.520 align:middle line:90%
with Christopher Mellon.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.100 align:middle line:10%
Christopher Mellon was
the Assistant Secretary

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.960 align:middle line:10%
of Defense for Intelligence.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.850 align:middle line:10%
And you would assume
that the intelligence--

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:14.720 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: He should have access.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.095 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: He
should have access.

00:11:16.095 --> 00:11:19.502 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out he wasn't
being given access either.

00:11:19.502 --> 00:11:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And as they went
around and started

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.330 align:middle line:84%
talking to a lot of people
inside the government who

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.330 align:middle line:84%
should've known, they weren't
being briefed in on this.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And so they became
aware of the fact

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.915 align:middle line:90%
that there were doors closing.

00:11:29.915 --> 00:11:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So what happened is Lue
submitted these three videos.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.230 align:middle line:90%
The go fast--

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which proved
the technological aspects

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.770 align:middle line:90%
of the story.

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:40.415 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:40.415 --> 00:11:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And well proved,
because they're always

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.500 align:middle line:84%
saying how come we don't have
any verified videos of these?

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, there they were.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There they are.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.748 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: There were
verified videos of these.

00:11:48.748 --> 00:11:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And he submitted them to
the proper authorities,

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.120 align:middle line:90%
and they were declassified.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.920 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's a major question.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:55.837 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And now why?

00:11:55.837 --> 00:11:58.003 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Why in the world
were those declassified?

00:11:58.003 --> 00:12:00.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And why, because we'd
been having drips since 2017

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:01.580 align:middle line:90%
through the "New York Times."

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:02.540 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be
vehicle of choice.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Because of those.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Because of those.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:09.830 align:middle line:84%
OK, so when Lue brought
these declassified videos out

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:14.720 align:middle line:84%
and resigned in protest
over the dissembling

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.380 align:middle line:84%
and the disinformation that was
being generated by the Defense

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Department about what was
known about these vehicles,

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.640 align:middle line:84%
he signed a letter
of resignation

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.160 align:middle line:90%
to give to General Mattis.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And his superiors refused
to pass his letter on,

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.150 align:middle line:84%
refused to allow that to go
to the proper chain of command

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.310 align:middle line:90%
and register his protest.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:41.900 align:middle line:84%
So he left and he brought
these three videos

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.100 align:middle line:90%
to the "New York Times."

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And the "New York
Times" very important step.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:47.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: You know I was there.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.437 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
remember that morning.

00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:51.310 align:middle line:90%
It's like finally.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well,
you remember, that I

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.950 align:middle line:84%
represented the "New York Times"
in the Pentagon Papers case.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:56.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So I was the one that
got the call from Jim Goodale.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:01.160 align:middle line:84%
The chief counsel for
the "New York Times"

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.910 align:middle line:84%
called me to let us know
that he had the documents,

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.752 align:middle line:84%
and then got us to represent
him or the "New York Times"

00:13:08.752 --> 00:13:10.460 align:middle line:84%
to get the right to
publish those things.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.790 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that there's
a decision making

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.760 align:middle line:84%
process that goes on in
"New York Times" as well.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:20.442 align:middle line:84%
They don't just publish any
top secret security information

00:13:20.442 --> 00:13:21.650 align:middle line:90%
that they get their hands on.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course not.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: They're very
responsible about this.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.380 align:middle line:84%
That was part of
the element that we

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.760 align:middle line:84%
had to prove to Judge Gurfein
when we were doing that case.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:32.180 align:middle line:84%
So not only was there a
decision made by Lue Elizondo,

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.390 align:middle line:84%
but he was joined
with Chris Mellon

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:38.420 align:middle line:84%
to make this decision, to bring
this to the "New York Times."

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a decision
made by the "New York Times"

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:42.170 align:middle line:90%
to reveal this.

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So that question has
to get answered still.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why?

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Why did the "New York
Times" agree to do this now?

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I
mean one assumes,

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.640 align:middle line:84%
and certainly the
work of some people

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.360 align:middle line:84%
have said they don't do anything
without having essentially

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:84%
the approval of the intelligence
community of this nature.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.047 align:middle line:90%
They work together.

00:14:00.047 --> 00:14:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: But I know
more about that then--

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:02.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell me.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: --whoever
you're quoting.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want you to tell
me, because that's all I know.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.198 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Because
that isn't true.

00:14:07.198 --> 00:14:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Those are people who have
reasonable suspicions,

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:12.420 align:middle line:84%
but they don't really
know about that stuff.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And so what they're doing
is they're speculating.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want you to
inform us about that,

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.070 align:middle line:90%
but can continue on this track.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.362 align:middle line:90%
And then let's talk about that.

00:14:17.362 --> 00:14:19.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So the bottom
line is that Lue and Chris

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Mellon brought out these
videos and gave them

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:23.330 align:middle line:90%
to the "New York Times."

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:26.870 align:middle line:84%
They were published
originally on their internet

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:29.660 align:middle line:90%
on the 16th of December of 2017.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And then on the front
page, above the fold,

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.190 align:middle line:84%
as they say on the 17th
of December of 2017.

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And then
all of a sudden,

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:43.940 align:middle line:84%
the people who wait for some
authority to tell them it's OK

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.670 align:middle line:84%
to believe something, all
of a sudden said, well,

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.170 align:middle line:84%
the "New York Times"
said this is--

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was a big deal.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That these are real.

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.773 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Then all
of a sudden, there

00:14:51.773 --> 00:14:54.200 align:middle line:84%
were all kinds of people who
were saying, wait a second,

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.540 align:middle line:84%
I've been being
told by authorities

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.690 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not supposed to
believe this for all this time.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but
I'll be ridiculed

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and I'll be attacked as
being irresponsible if I even

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.225 align:middle line:90%
talk about this stuff.

00:15:07.225 --> 00:15:09.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out there
was a full conscious program

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.780 align:middle line:84%
operating inside the
Defense Department

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and the Central
Intelligence Agency, which

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:18.050 align:middle line:84%
we know about now, that is
proven they had a policy

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.590 align:middle line:84%
to attack and destroy the
reputation of anybody who

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:22.850 align:middle line:90%
tried to report these things.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Which was all part
of the maintenance of secrecy.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:25.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.205 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So they could
maintain monopoly control

00:15:28.205 --> 00:15:29.080 align:middle line:90%
over this technology.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how did this
get declassified and end up

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:31.950 align:middle line:90%
in the "New York Times?"

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, that's a
question yet to be answered.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.130 align:middle line:84%
That's a question
yet to be answered.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.045 align:middle line:90%
And I need to know--

00:15:39.045 --> 00:15:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've been wondering
about it since it happened.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, I've
been wondering about it

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:43.950 align:middle line:90%
since it happened.

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:47.540 align:middle line:84%
But I was wondering, and then I
got contacted by Lue Elizondo.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And it
moved from wandering

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.700 align:middle line:84%
into being charged with
responsibility for helping

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.020 align:middle line:84%
to find out the answers
to these questions, right.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now, OK--

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So that's
the situation I'm in.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Continue
this and I want

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.690 align:middle line:84%
to ask you one more question
about he and Christopher

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:00.360 align:middle line:90%
Mellon.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.943 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So the
bottom line is that,

00:16:01.943 --> 00:16:04.810 align:middle line:84%
as you know and many
of your listeners know,

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:07.978 align:middle line:84%
that I've been involved
in this particular issue

00:16:07.978 --> 00:16:10.270 align:middle line:84%
since I was general counsel
to the United States Jesuit

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:12.460 align:middle line:84%
headquarters in their
National Social Ministry

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.070 align:middle line:84%
office in Washington
D.C. for 20 years.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And I got contacted back in
1977 when President Carter was

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:20.905 align:middle line:90%
elected in November of 1976.

00:16:20.905 --> 00:16:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You were a kid.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And was denied
access to the program.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.827 align:middle line:84%
And so he went through the
Congressional Research Service,

00:16:27.827 --> 00:16:29.410 align:middle line:84%
their science and
technology division,

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.110 align:middle line:84%
to try to get access to
some of this information.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was contacted by
them as Jesuit counsel

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.500 align:middle line:84%
to see if I could get access
to the Vatican Library

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.560 align:middle line:84%
to get access to what they
knew about UFOs and ETs.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.180 align:middle line:84%
So that's how I became
involved in this to begin with.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.778 align:middle line:84%
And then I was later
contacted by Dr. John Mack,

00:16:46.778 --> 00:16:48.820 align:middle line:84%
the head of the Department
of Clinical Psychiatry

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.130 align:middle line:84%
at Harvard Medical
School, who published

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:54.580 align:middle line:84%
a book about this extraordinary
phenomenon of people

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:58.000 align:middle line:84%
encountering the occupants
of these vehicles

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and going through the
psychological trauma of trying

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.248 align:middle line:84%
to adjust to this
super different reality

00:17:03.248 --> 00:17:04.540 align:middle line:90%
than they had been living with.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.339 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which was
a huge leap of faith

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:08.740 align:middle line:84%
for him, because he was
tortured by Harvard after that.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:09.573 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Oh, yeah.

00:17:09.573 --> 00:17:11.599 align:middle line:84%
It was a major event,
went on for 18 months.

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And so I represented
him during that process.

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And so then I was
contacted by Dr. Steven

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:21.700 align:middle line:84%
Greer with the Disclosure
Project in 2001.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was in charge of vetting
all of the dozens and dozens

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:26.980 align:middle line:84%
and dozens of
potential witnesses

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:31.300 align:middle line:84%
about UFO issues to select
21 of the major people who

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.190 align:middle line:84%
would testify in those hearings
at the National Press Club.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.073 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: To all the
staffs of the major senators

00:17:37.073 --> 00:17:38.410 align:middle line:90%
and congresspeople.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I was also
made general counsel

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.820 align:middle line:90%
to the 2013 citizens hearings--

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, Stephen Bassett.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:44.632 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: --that
Stephen Bassett

00:17:44.632 --> 00:17:46.160 align:middle line:90%
and all the rest of people did.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And so the bottom line is I've
been at this for a long time.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So when Lue Elizondo
reached out and contacted

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:56.610 align:middle line:84%
me to ask me to
represent him, we

00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:00.728 align:middle line:84%
had some very important
conversations about that,

00:18:00.728 --> 00:18:02.520 align:middle line:84%
as to what the nature
of the representation

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.800 align:middle line:84%
would be, what the scope
of it would be, et cetera.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And he, Lue, was
devoted to trying

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:11.850 align:middle line:84%
to get all of the information
that was not legitimately

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:15.240 align:middle line:84%
classified, and was quite
convinced that there was lots

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.330 align:middle line:84%
of information that was
not legally classified,

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:21.600 align:middle line:84%
was not legitimately classified,
that this needed to be shared

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.250 align:middle line:90%
with the people of the world.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Because this was an
extraordinary phenomenon going

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.970 align:middle line:90%
on here.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And he became convinced
that the vast majority

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:84%
of these sightings were not
some super secret technology

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.720 align:middle line:84%
that we had developed to
whatever degree we had,

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.940 align:middle line:84%
and there are some
questions about all of that.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.550 align:middle line:84%
But that the vast majority of
these sightings were not that,

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.220 align:middle line:84%
and was convinced
they were not Russian,

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.630 align:middle line:84%
they were not Chinese, for
two different reasons, three

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:48.430 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:52.160 align:middle line:84%
One is that if in fact
Russia or China possessed

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.390 align:middle line:84%
the technology of this
absolutely extraordinary

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:57.660 align:middle line:84%
nature, they could go
43,000 miles an hour

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.130 align:middle line:84%
inside our atmosphere
without burning to a crisp,

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.210 align:middle line:84%
they could make 90 degree angle
turns at that speed, which

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:07.560 align:middle line:84%
would generate 600 Gs
of centrifugal force,

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.550 align:middle line:84%
and could go under the water
and travel at 200 miles an hour

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.960 align:middle line:84%
under the water, if they
had anything like that

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.497 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't know
all about it, it

00:19:15.497 --> 00:19:17.580 align:middle line:84%
would have been the most
catastrophic intelligence

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.080 align:middle line:84%
failure in the history
of the human family.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.663 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And highly
unlikely to boot.

00:19:20.663 --> 00:19:23.435 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah, and
secondly, very importantly,

00:19:23.435 --> 00:19:25.395 align:middle line:84%
and he told the
Associated Press when

00:19:25.395 --> 00:19:29.730 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting there right with
him, he said that moreover,

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:31.620 align:middle line:84%
we in the government
had been monitoring

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:36.330 align:middle line:84%
this exact type of technology
all the way back to 1947,

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:37.240 align:middle line:90%
he said.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea that China
would have had that when

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.670 align:middle line:84%
China, his term, their
means of transportation

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:46.180 align:middle line:90%
were ox carts with stone wheels.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.158 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: He said
and Russia in 1947

00:19:49.158 --> 00:19:50.700 align:middle line:84%
had just gotten out
of World War Two.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just off the farm.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And they just
lost 20 million people

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:54.330 align:middle line:90%
in World War Two.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:54.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.232 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And were tearing up
the rail lines that went there

00:19:57.232 --> 00:19:58.790 align:middle line:90%
to Europe so they'd have metal.

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.480 align:middle line:84%
So this is
preposterous, he said.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's preposterous.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So he
said so given that--

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:07.260 align:middle line:84%
and then Dan Huff of
the "Associated Press"

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.830 align:middle line:84%
was kind of stunned
that he was eliminating

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:12.220 align:middle line:90%
those possibilities, right?

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: He said,
well what could they be?

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And then Lue told
him, he said, well,

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.710 align:middle line:84%
the most probable thing
that we were looking at

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.600 align:middle line:84%
is that they were
extraterrestrial.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so
now AP has that.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: And there they were.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:24.892 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is recent?

00:20:24.892 --> 00:20:28.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Yes,
that was on May 4th.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, on May
4th so he said that.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:33.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, now I want to ask a
couple of things about Lue.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Did Lue have access to other
archival film besides the three

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:38.880 align:middle line:84%
that ended up, the
tick tack and all that?

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:39.255 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Oh, yes.

00:20:39.255 --> 00:20:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm assuming he did.

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Oh, yes.

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, this is one
of the things that some people

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:48.510 align:middle line:84%
have said, which is why are we
saying we don't know anything

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:51.840 align:middle line:84%
about this when people
certainly at certain levels

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:55.950 align:middle line:84%
of the military
industrial complex

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:58.200 align:middle line:90%
do have an idea of what this is?

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Because they've been
looking into it,

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:03.480 align:middle line:84%
they've housed pieces of it,
it not full craft, for decades.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.960 align:middle line:84%
So this seems like there's
a little disjuncture

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.330 align:middle line:84%
there between we just
want to know if it's real

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:10.200 align:middle line:90%
and what's going on.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Lue must have already
known this is real.

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, now, we have
to exercise some care here.

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Because use of the term we,
what we know or what they did,

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.240 align:middle line:84%
that one of the things
that we discovered

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.430 align:middle line:84%
is that inside the
Defense Department

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:29.790 align:middle line:84%
there is still this
fluid situation where

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:32.370 align:middle line:84%
they haven't really determined
what to do about all this

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:33.170 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:35.253 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and I can
see the sensitivity there.

00:21:35.253 --> 00:21:37.387 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: They had a
very clear idea about it.

00:21:37.387 --> 00:21:38.970 align:middle line:84%
We're going to keep
it totally secret.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:40.230 align:middle line:90%
We're going to lie about it.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.875 align:middle line:84%
We're going to destroy anybody
who tries to report it.

00:21:42.875 --> 00:21:44.250 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
we do if any kind

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:46.650 align:middle line:84%
of a major official
inside the military

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:48.240 align:middle line:84%
wants to make a
report of a UFO--

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Discredit
them, take them down.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.142 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: We'll
discredit, send them

00:21:51.142 --> 00:21:54.030 align:middle line:84%
to get a psychiatric
study, all this stuff.

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:57.480 align:middle line:84%
So there have been
some it's not clear

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.640 align:middle line:84%
whether they had
succeeded in coming up

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.970 align:middle line:84%
with any kind of a
new protocol for what

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:08.250 align:middle line:84%
to do about this once 2007,
once this study was being

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:09.360 align:middle line:90%
undertaken.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.820 align:middle line:84%
It's perfectly clear
that there were elements

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.940 align:middle line:84%
inside the National Security
State infrastructure that

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.980 align:middle line:90%
were blocking Lue's study.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
so tread carefully.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.295 align:middle line:84%
Would you be conservative,
tread carefully.

00:22:20.295 --> 00:22:21.295 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:22:21.295 --> 00:22:22.890 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom line
is there's clearly

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:26.130 align:middle line:84%
elements inside the
defense industry

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:29.280 align:middle line:84%
and inside the National
Security State bureaucracy that

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:33.090 align:middle line:84%
are highly reactionary,
are extremely

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:35.730 align:middle line:84%
possessive of the
information that they've got,

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.100 align:middle line:84%
are still dedicated to
trying to develop this

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.870 align:middle line:84%
into some sort of
a weapon system

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.730 align:middle line:84%
to give us massive
superiority so we

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:43.393 align:middle line:84%
can establish full
spectrum dominance

00:22:43.393 --> 00:22:44.310 align:middle line:90%
over the whole planet.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And are hoping that
eventually someday they

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.540 align:middle line:84%
will be able to get a line of
funding going to the Defense

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Department to protect
our whole planet

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.870 align:middle line:84%
against an extraterrestrial
civilization.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:59.530 align:middle line:84%
There's an element inside
the defense industry

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:02.860 align:middle line:84%
and the National Security
State that are into that.

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.417 align:middle line:90%
Now, but above that group--

00:23:04.417 --> 00:23:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:08.485 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Above that
group is some other group

00:23:08.485 --> 00:23:10.635 align:middle line:90%
that gets this information.

00:23:10.635 --> 00:23:12.677 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk--
Danny, you talk about this

00:23:12.677 --> 00:23:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and the word fascism
comes up, as it should.

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.352 align:middle line:84%
People don't understand
what the word fascism means.

00:23:17.352 --> 00:23:19.060 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
the degree to which

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:22.900 align:middle line:84%
we're already in lockstep
with it, and don't know it.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And I would like you to go
back historically, and then

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.390 align:middle line:84%
at the end of our conversation,
and we'll get to the day.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:30.848 align:middle line:84%
What is it, June 25th this year
where the report came out--

00:23:30.848 --> 00:23:31.648 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah.

00:23:31.648 --> 00:23:34.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --and underwhelmed
everybody, and why that was.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.385 align:middle line:84%
But let's take a few
minutes to talk about who

00:23:36.385 --> 00:23:38.030 align:middle line:90%
these other others are.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:45.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reality is that our
whole human family has almost

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:49.030 align:middle line:84%
always, since the
dawn of our species,

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:55.240 align:middle line:84%
had certain alpha men and women
who assert kind of leadership,

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.610 align:middle line:84%
if not dominion, over the
rest of the community.

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:01.990 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes for better,
sometimes for worse,

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:04.750 align:middle line:84%
they have this kind of
authoritative position

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:06.610 align:middle line:90%
inside the communities.

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And some of them use
it wisely, or used it

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.970 align:middle line:84%
wisely as authoritative
leaders instead

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:14.500 align:middle line:90%
of authoritarian leaders.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Others distorted it and
became authoritarian.

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's gone on all
throughout history.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.860 align:middle line:84%
In our particular country, we
are quite proud of the fact

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:29.870 align:middle line:84%
that we threw off the tyranny of
this elite, the royalist class

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:30.670 align:middle line:90%
of people.

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And those of us, those are the
people who came to the colonies

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.750 align:middle line:84%
and ignored the fact
that there were millions

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:40.600 align:middle line:84%
of Native Indigenous
people here and just

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.790 align:middle line:90%
said oh, we found this.

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And got the institution of the
church, the Catholic church,

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:47.410 align:middle line:84%
through the doctrine
of discovery

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:50.800 align:middle line:84%
to authorize them to claim
the territory despite there

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.320 align:middle line:84%
were all these other
people here, OK.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So there was an elite
European white culture

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:01.600 align:middle line:84%
dominated by the men who
asserted control over all

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.353 align:middle line:90%
of these resources, et cetera.

00:25:03.353 --> 00:25:05.020 align:middle line:84%
So we know right from
the very beginning

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:10.750 align:middle line:84%
in our country there was this
elitist, racialist minority

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:13.840 align:middle line:84%
that asserted the right to
dominate the vast majority

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.580 align:middle line:90%
of people on the continent.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is
the governing structures

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:22.800 align:middle line:84%
that they set up carried
into continuation some

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.740 align:middle line:84%
of the elements of
the royalist class

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:29.520 align:middle line:84%
in Europe, where they had this
elite group of people that

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.510 align:middle line:84%
were white male landowners,
large landowners, who ended up

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:36.130 align:middle line:90%
being in the Senate.

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And then there was this
House of Representatives

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.170 align:middle line:84%
that didn't really
represent the people at all.

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:41.718 align:middle line:90%
Women weren't represented.

00:25:41.718 --> 00:25:43.260 align:middle line:84%
Non-white people
weren't represented.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Landowner white
men were able to vote.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.810 align:middle line:84%
OK, and they were all
represented by Alexander

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:51.270 align:middle line:90%
Hamilton and the Hamiltonians.

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.490 align:middle line:84%
There was this whole element
that were like Tories,

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:57.840 align:middle line:84%
as they referred to them,
that were kind of elitists.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And Alexander Hamilton,
despite the goodwill

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:04.080 align:middle line:84%
he's been generated by the
Broadway play or musical,

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.050 align:middle line:84%
was in fact, the lawyer
for these mercantilists

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:11.850 align:middle line:84%
and these merchant class
people, the financial minority.

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to have a
new government much stronger

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:18.120 align:middle line:84%
than the Articles
of Confederation,

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.550 align:middle line:84%
which was just a
confederation or like

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:23.250 align:middle line:90%
a coalition of the 13 colonies.

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And the sovereignty resided
in the colonies themselves

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:37.770 align:middle line:84%
all the way from 1776 to
1781, that whole thing went on

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:41.400 align:middle line:84%
until you had the
Articles of Confederation.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.500 align:middle line:84%
But it was the
mercantile class that

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.650 align:middle line:84%
wanted to have a much stronger
centralized government,

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:48.720 align:middle line:84%
primarily for the
purposes of benefiting

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.730 align:middle line:90%
their commercial activities.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:52.410 align:middle line:84%
They wanted common
weights and measures.

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:53.790 align:middle line:90%
They wanted common currencies.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:58.440 align:middle line:84%
They wanted common rules
of trade to take place,

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.910 align:middle line:84%
and that was a
lot of the impetus

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:03.300 align:middle line:84%
for the creating of the federal
government on their part.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And they were part
of the Federalists

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.510 align:middle line:84%
that wrote the
Federalist Papers,

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:10.308 align:middle line:84%
and that was Alexander
Hamilton in those.

00:27:10.308 --> 00:27:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
this other element

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:15.173 align:middle line:84%
that was led by
Madison, James Madison.

00:27:15.173 --> 00:27:16.590 align:middle line:84%
They're known as
the Jeffersonians

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:18.840 align:middle line:84%
because he was more
well-known, but the fact

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.210 align:middle line:84%
is that Jefferson and
Madison and Aaron Burr

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:24.330 align:middle line:84%
and those other people
were much more into trying

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:27.660 align:middle line:84%
to maintain a
limited government,

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:30.660 align:middle line:84%
a limited central
government that

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.330 align:middle line:84%
didn't have these kind
of plenipotentiary powers

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:34.240 align:middle line:90%
of any kind.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a tension
right at the very beginning

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:37.770 align:middle line:90%
of our government.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And that went on from 1789, when
they crafted the original three

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:46.270 align:middle line:84%
articles to set up
the legislature,

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:48.210 align:middle line:84%
the executive branch,
and the judicial branch.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And then 1791, when the
Madisonians rose and got

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:58.380 align:middle line:84%
the Bill of Rights put in, which
is infused with the natural law

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:01.170 align:middle line:84%
principles that were
taught to many of them

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.600 align:middle line:84%
by John Witherspoon at
the College of New Jersey,

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.620 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.500 align:middle line:84%
It became Princeton
University that there

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.050 align:middle line:84%
were 39 of the original
Congress people

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.180 align:middle line:90%
were all taught by this one man.

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And they were steeped in
natural law traditions,

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.880 align:middle line:84%
different from
Alexander Hamilton.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.892 align:middle line:84%
And it included not only James
Madison and Aaron Burr, who

00:28:20.892 --> 00:28:22.350 align:middle line:84%
you remember, Aaron
Burr is the one

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:23.070 align:middle line:90%
that killed Alexander Hamilton.

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:24.128 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Killed, yes.

00:28:24.128 --> 00:28:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: It was the
tension between these two--

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was so great.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: --elements
was so intense, OK.

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:30.055 align:middle line:84%
So this element has been
there since the beginning,

00:28:30.055 --> 00:28:32.220 align:middle line:90%
this elitist group of people.

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And when the American
Civil War took place,

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:41.190 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the American Civil
War the elitists won the war.

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:43.385 align:middle line:84%
And they were into a stronger
centralized government

00:28:43.385 --> 00:28:45.760 align:middle line:84%
that would serve the interests
of the major mercantilists

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and the industrialists,
et cetera.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:51.750 align:middle line:84%
They suppressed the agrarian
people in the south.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is from 1868
at the end of the American

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Civil War to 1898,
just a 30 year period,

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a period
that just goes back

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:01.850 align:middle line:90%
to when Reagan was president.

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:02.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Right, in
that 30 year period there

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:09.720 align:middle line:84%
arose this like 25
to 30 families led

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:14.220 align:middle line:84%
by major hard-charging
alpha males that monopolized

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.680 align:middle line:90%
various aspects of our economy.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Took over the
agricultural industry,

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:23.040 align:middle line:84%
took over the shipping lanes,
took over the railroads,

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.860 align:middle line:84%
took over the production
of steel and metal,

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.400 align:middle line:84%
pharmaceuticals, they
rose into monopolizing

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.892 align:middle line:90%
these portions of our society.

00:29:30.892 --> 00:29:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Banking, of course.

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:33.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: And banking.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And so all of that took
place in a 30 year period,

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:40.710 align:middle line:84%
came to it's full fruition
with McKinley in 1898

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:45.180 align:middle line:84%
with Mark Hanna, who was
his kind of promoter.

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And what they did
is they basically

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.360 align:middle line:84%
took over the instrumentalities
of the federal government.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And they put them
all at the disposal

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:55.260 align:middle line:84%
of the interests
of this new entity,

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:58.470 align:middle line:84%
this new business entity
called corporation.

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:02.160 align:middle line:10%
The corporations didn't
exist like this until 1872,

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.390 align:middle line:10%
into this process.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.880 align:middle line:10%
And what they did is
these mercantilists

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.770 align:middle line:10%
that owned these big
monopoly interests

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:12.000 align:middle line:10%
in the areas of the economy
devised this new instrument

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.290 align:middle line:10%
by means of which you could
own the shares of a company

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:19.480 align:middle line:10%
and be completely immunized
against any liability

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.980 align:middle line:10%
for whatever the company did.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And so then you
would task people

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.490 align:middle line:84%
you hired to run
your corporation

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:26.770 align:middle line:84%
to just simply maximize
the profits in any way

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:28.100 align:middle line:90%
that they possibly could.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And they too were
immunized personally

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:33.820 align:middle line:84%
of any liability for
whatever wrongdoing they did.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And only the assets
of the corporation

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:38.500 align:middle line:84%
were subject to
common law lawsuits.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So what you had done is you
created this sinful structure,

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:45.760 align:middle line:84%
right, in 1872 that was the
vehicle of the elite that

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.560 align:middle line:84%
actually figured
out how to control

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.780 align:middle line:90%
the resources of the country.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And what they did is they took
over all the instrumentalities

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:53.200 align:middle line:90%
of the government.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.168 align:middle line:84%
They started bribing the
United States senators

00:30:55.168 --> 00:30:57.460 align:middle line:84%
and congressmen, paying for
their elections, et cetera.

00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.155 align:middle line:84%
And they've continued
that kind of control--

00:30:59.155 --> 00:30:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Today.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: They continued
that kind of control.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:01.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And they came to
kind of full manifestation

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:10.570 align:middle line:84%
in a private investor
group of these 30 families

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:15.100 align:middle line:84%
that held a chair in a group
called Brown Brothers Harriman.

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And the Brown Brothers Harriman
was a private investment group.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.740 align:middle line:84%
They had a staff,
the CEO of which

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.980 align:middle line:90%
was George Herbert Walker.

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And that sounds familiar
to you because he

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:28.120 align:middle line:84%
was the grandfather of
George Herbert Walker Bush,

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.630 align:middle line:84%
and he was the CEO
of that operation.

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:34.510 align:middle line:90%
The lawyer was Allen Dulles, OK.

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And the law firm
that represented him

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:37.840 align:middle line:90%
was Sullivan and Cromwell.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And this alliance between
Sullivan and Cromwell,

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:43.720 align:middle line:84%
this major law
firm, Cromwell being

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.870 align:middle line:84%
the guy who took over Panama
so they could build the Panama

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:48.610 align:middle line:90%
Canal, again, for the merchants.

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: OK, this
whole group basically

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.970 align:middle line:84%
seized complete control
virtually over our government,

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:55.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:55.870 --> 00:32:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And so they ended up drafting
The Versailles Treaty.

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.180 align:middle line:84%
They ended up creating
the Union Bank

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:06.370 align:middle line:84%
of New York, which
financed the rise

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:07.760 align:middle line:90%
of the fascists in Germany.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And it came into it,
that was the first time that

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:13.600 align:middle line:90%
this fascist--

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.240 align:middle line:84%
fascism, there's
a major treatise

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.940 align:middle line:84%
that was written by
Benito Mussolini on this,

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.827 align:middle line:84%
that fascism is a theory
of economic development.

00:32:21.827 --> 00:32:24.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and this is
what I want you to explain.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.180 align:middle line:90%
People don't understand this.

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:25.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a--

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
what we relate to.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:29.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: It's
not what we think.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.170 align:middle line:84%
We've been subjected to the
propaganda from World War Two

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:35.500 align:middle line:84%
that all the fascists
are these goosestepping

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Nazis with the monocle
and saber scar,

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and six league boots with
the riding crop and all that.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
Nazis, they're all

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:47.150 align:middle line:84%
characterized in
movies, et cetera.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:50.050 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is,
fascism is an economic theory

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:53.020 align:middle line:84%
pursuant to which the
owners of industry

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:56.050 align:middle line:84%
and the major
corporations get control

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:58.390 align:middle line:84%
of the instrumentalities
of the government.

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
instrumentalities

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:03.232 align:middle line:84%
of the government are put at
the disposal of the interests

00:33:03.232 --> 00:33:04.315 align:middle line:90%
of the major corporations.

00:33:04.315 --> 00:33:04.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Corporations.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And the short
of it is, what's good

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:08.410 align:middle line:84%
for General Motors is
good for the country.

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, John
Perkins, I don't

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.135 align:middle line:84%
know if he's the one that
coined the term corporatocracy,

00:33:12.135 --> 00:33:14.020 align:middle line:84%
but that is exactly
what fascism is.

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That's
exactly what it is.

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:16.245 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
that's what we are.

00:33:16.245 --> 00:33:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And that's what had
taken control of the United

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:19.050 align:middle line:90%
States government.

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, this went on all the
way through World War One.

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:26.650 align:middle line:84%
When World War One broke out
in Europe and the United States

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:30.970 align:middle line:84%
came in and became part of
this thing, up until 1917.

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Then in 1918, there was
the Versailles Treaty

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.770 align:middle line:90%
that was signed.

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:38.830 align:middle line:84%
People don't know this,
but the Versailles Treaty,

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:41.410 align:middle line:84%
the Versailles Treaty was
supervised by a fellow

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:45.340 align:middle line:90%
by the name of Robert Lansing.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Robert Lansing was the
Secretary of State under Wilson.

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Robert Lansing was the
son-in-law of John W Foster.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.200 align:middle line:84%
John W Foster was the
grandfather of John Foster

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.260 align:middle line:90%
Dulles and Allen Dulles.

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.300 align:middle line:84%
This linkage is
extremely powerful,

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:04.030 align:middle line:84%
because Robert Lansing, who
is the Secretary of State

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:07.120 align:middle line:84%
for the United States under
Wilson at the end of World War

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.630 align:middle line:84%
One, brought in his two nephews,
John Foster Dulles and Allen

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:13.399 align:middle line:84%
Dulles, to sit with him in the
negotiations of the Versailles

00:34:13.399 --> 00:34:14.199 align:middle line:90%
Treaty.

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And they drafted into the treaty
the reparations requirements--

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: --that they
imposed on Germany.

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which ended
up in World War Two.

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And what happened, very
importantly, those reparations

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.910 align:middle line:90%
were imposed upon Germany.

00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:26.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:28.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And Allen
Dulles, who was

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:32.920 align:middle line:84%
the drafter, along with his
brother John Foster Dulles,

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:37.690 align:middle line:84%
of these provisions was
made the lawyer for Germany

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:40.520 align:middle line:84%
by the American Secretary of
State at the end of the war.

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And he was also the attorney
for Brown Brothers Harriman.

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:46.989 align:middle line:84%
So what they did is they
organized a series of loans

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:49.360 align:middle line:84%
from the individual
wealthy families that

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.010 align:middle line:84%
were members of Brown
Brothers Harriman

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:56.080 align:middle line:84%
to give loans to Germany to
pay the reparations to pay

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.800 align:middle line:84%
to corporations that had been
injured during World War One.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And so
that what they did

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.650 align:middle line:84%
is they took stock in
those companies in Germany.

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And what they did,
very importantly,

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:06.730 align:middle line:84%
the CEO of Brown
Brothers Harriman,

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:12.760 align:middle line:84%
who was George Herbert Walker,
stepped out in 1924 as the CEO

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.680 align:middle line:84%
and turned it over
to his son-in-law,

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:18.990 align:middle line:90%
who was Prescott Bush.

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Prescott Bush became the CEO
for Brown Brothers Harriman.

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:24.990 align:middle line:84%
George Herbert
Walker stepped out,

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:26.880 align:middle line:84%
formed the Union
Bank of New York,

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:30.570 align:middle line:84%
capitalized by the financiers
in the Brown Brothers Harriman,

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.060 align:middle line:84%
created that Union
Bank of New York.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Set up a subsidiary in Germany
known as the Bank of Shipping

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:39.390 align:middle line:84%
and Commerce with
this guy Thyssen that

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:42.210 align:middle line:84%
ran that, and
started giving loans

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:45.220 align:middle line:84%
to Germany and to
the Nazi movement.

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.728 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: They financed
the construction

00:35:47.728 --> 00:35:50.310 align:middle line:84%
of the international
headquarters of the Nazi party,

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:52.330 align:middle line:90%
that bank system did.

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to set
them up as the bulwark

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:55.968 align:middle line:90%
against Bolshevism.

00:35:55.968 --> 00:35:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Because what had happened
is, right at the end of War--

00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They prefer fascism.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Because at the end of World
War One, the people in Russia

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.580 align:middle line:90%
rose up and threw out the czar.

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:07.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Who had been
joined in World War One

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:12.270 align:middle line:84%
and were depleting the
resources of Russia.

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:15.990 align:middle line:84%
So they threw the czar out and
set up a People's Socialist

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:17.040 align:middle line:90%
Republic there.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And Robert Lansing
immediately sent a US

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:23.250 align:middle line:84%
military expeditionary
force into Russia

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:25.967 align:middle line:84%
to try to crush the
Bolsheviks, which people

00:36:25.967 --> 00:36:28.300 align:middle line:84%
99.9% of anybody listening
doesn't even know about that.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, we don't know.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.503 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: They sent in a whole
foreign military expeditionary

00:36:31.503 --> 00:36:33.780 align:middle line:84%
force to try to crush
the Russian Revolution

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:34.890 align:middle line:90%
in the cradle.

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's what started that
hostility toward the west, OK.

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And so that thing has been
going on since 1917, October.

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:45.092 align:middle line:84%
There's been this effort on
the part of the elite, who

00:36:45.092 --> 00:36:47.550 align:middle line:84%
are represented by the Brown
Brothers Harriman and Sullivan

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:49.258 align:middle line:84%
and Cromwell, the
Union Bank of New York,

00:36:49.258 --> 00:36:53.700 align:middle line:84%
and that whole element to crush
the Social Democratic movement

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:54.500 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which happened
in recent elections.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Oh, that's right.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:58.500 align:middle line:90%
So what I'm--

00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:59.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Same thing
is happening again.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: What I'm
saying is historically

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:05.280 align:middle line:84%
what happened is that this
began right after the Treaty

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.710 align:middle line:84%
of Versailles, they
were setting up

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:11.820 align:middle line:84%
this fascist set of
governments in Germany

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.850 align:middle line:84%
to be the bulwark
against Bolshevism,

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:19.380 align:middle line:84%
as they called it in Europe,
has wedded this elite

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.940 align:middle line:84%
to the whole economic
theory of fascism.

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So fascist capitalism
is a lot different than just

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:27.830 align:middle line:90%
a free trade.

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:30.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot different than
just entrepreneurial spirit

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.230 align:middle line:90%
or free business.

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:33.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody has
a right if they engage

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:36.990 align:middle line:84%
in bringing some people together
and setting up a business

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:40.140 align:middle line:84%
and making shoes or making cars
or whatever they want to do,

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:42.300 align:middle line:84%
as long as they're willing
to accept responsibility

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:43.740 align:middle line:90%
for anybody they damage.

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:45.765 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but not rigging
the entire game in your favor.

00:37:45.765 --> 00:37:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: No.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.653 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Without our knowledge.

00:37:47.653 --> 00:37:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And that's
what's happened.

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're saying here is
that that element has been here

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:54.640 align:middle line:90%
since the beginning.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened is that,
for example, immediately

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:02.280 align:middle line:84%
at the end of World War
Two, for example, when

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:06.000 align:middle line:84%
the G2, the head of
US Army Intelligence

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.620 align:middle line:84%
in the Philippines,
Edward Landsdale,

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:15.030 align:middle line:84%
discovered the Japanese had
buried billions-- trillions,

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:18.870 align:middle line:84%
actually, dollars worth
of gold and platinum

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:21.630 align:middle line:84%
and silver and stuff all
through the Philippines,

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:23.310 align:middle line:90%
they uncovered a bunch of it.

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:25.990 align:middle line:90%
And they told Truman about this.

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And rather than
turn this over back

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:34.290 align:middle line:84%
to the people who Japan had
stolen it from all through Asia

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:39.840 align:middle line:84%
from 1926 to 1940, that
whole thing, what they did

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:45.060 align:middle line:84%
is they took the gold
12 troughs of it,

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:48.513 align:middle line:84%
which totaled $1.2
trillion, and--

00:38:48.513 --> 00:38:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Those wars are
still going on today.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:52.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: --and put it
into a private trust.

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And
MacArthur was told

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.230 align:middle line:90%
about this by Ed Landsdale.

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And MacArthur sent Landsdale
and MacArthur's G2,

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:06.300 align:middle line:84%
a guy named Charles Willoughby,
sent him to meet with Truman.

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And they set up the meeting,
brokered by his chief of staff,

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:13.620 align:middle line:90%
and they met.

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as
they realized what

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:19.232 align:middle line:84%
they had with this $1.2
trillion in gold, what they did

00:39:19.232 --> 00:39:21.440 align:middle line:84%
is they didn't tell the
American government about it.

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.010 align:middle line:84%
They didn't tell the
American people about it.

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:25.440 align:middle line:84%
What they did is they got two
partners from Brown Brothers

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Harriman to become
the trustees for this.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.460 align:middle line:90%
And then they--

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did that go into black
ops projects from that point?

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, the
first thing it did

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.220 align:middle line:84%
is start funding
fascists around the world

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:37.890 align:middle line:90%
to defeat the partisans.

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:40.170 align:middle line:84%
The partisans that had
fought in World War Two

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:43.080 align:middle line:84%
in all the different European
countries against the fascists,

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.870 align:middle line:84%
the elitists in
the United States

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:48.720 align:middle line:84%
didn't want them to be
elected to be mayors

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.340 align:middle line:90%
or governors or anything else.

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:52.800 align:middle line:84%
They wanted those people
out, because most of them

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.370 align:middle line:90%
had become social Democrats.

00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:55.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:57.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And the Lincoln
Brigade and that whole crowd.

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.540 align:middle line:84%
But what they wanted to do is
they wanted to suppress them.

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And they brought Nazis,
fascists, they financed them,

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:07.860 align:middle line:84%
got them new identities,
new names and everything,

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:10.290 align:middle line:84%
and got them elected,
financed their elections

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:12.510 align:middle line:84%
by issuing gold
certificates based

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:15.000 align:middle line:84%
upon this trove of
treasure that they had.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.730 align:middle line:84%
So this elite operation
has been going on.

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And what that did is that
represented the model--

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.990 align:middle line:84%
now, that's 1945, that
was December 1945.

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:28.520 align:middle line:84%
In July of 1947, less
than two years later,

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:30.050 align:middle line:84%
when they discovered
this crashed

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:33.860 align:middle line:84%
saucer in Roswell,
what they did is

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.960 align:middle line:84%
they brought it to Wright
Field, which was a US government

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:37.760 align:middle line:90%
installation.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.302 align:middle line:84%
But what they did
is they established

00:40:39.302 --> 00:40:42.050 align:middle line:84%
this other elite group
very similar to what

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:44.330 align:middle line:90%
they call the Anderson Trust.

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Two of the trustees for that
were Robert Anderson and Robert

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Lovett, both of whom were senior
partners at Brown Brothers

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:52.330 align:middle line:90%
Harriman.

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And then John Jay
McCloy was the third guy

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:57.810 align:middle line:84%
that became the head of the new
government of the United States

00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:58.610 align:middle line:90%
in Germany.

00:40:58.610 --> 00:40:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
did this elite group

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.158 align:middle line:90%
do in response to the crash?

00:41:01.158 --> 00:41:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well,
this is interesting.

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.160 align:middle line:84%
So what they've
done, obviously, is

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:07.250 align:middle line:84%
they've taken custody
of this technology

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:10.010 align:middle line:84%
and they've brought
in major corporations,

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Lockheed Martin, Boeing, others,
swore them to complete secrecy.

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And they've started
making technology

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.283 align:middle line:84%
available to them
to try to figure out

00:41:18.283 --> 00:41:19.760 align:middle line:90%
how to back engineer the stuff.

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:24.440 align:middle line:84%
They set up these
skunkworks, S4 at Area 51,

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.888 align:middle line:84%
Ben Rich and all those people
that ran that operation.

00:41:26.888 --> 00:41:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And what they've
been doing is trying

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:32.540 align:middle line:84%
to monopolize this
new technology

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:35.360 align:middle line:84%
and monopolize all
the information

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:39.080 align:middle line:84%
about who the occupants are
and where they come from

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.580 align:middle line:84%
and what they're
up to, et cetera.

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:43.190 align:middle line:84%
We don't know yet
the degree to which

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:46.130 align:middle line:84%
they've had any kind of
diplomatic relations with them.

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:48.710 align:middle line:84%
We have different people
who have testified.

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:52.940 align:middle line:84%
I've interviewed people who
profess quite credibly to have

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:56.780 align:middle line:84%
actually been present when
an ET was being interviewed,

00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.620 align:middle line:84%
and that they have little notes
and stuff from the interview,

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:03.890 align:middle line:84%
talking about what they were
doing, what their purposes were

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:05.220 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:06.560 align:middle line:90%
And so I've seen a lot of that.

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And because I know all
about that stuff that's

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.660 align:middle line:84%
one of the reasons that
Lue Elizondo reached out

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:14.360 align:middle line:90%
to me to have me represent him.

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Because he was really
upset about the fact

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:20.210 align:middle line:84%
that the Defense Department was
continuing to lie about this.

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Continued to lie,
say they didn't

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.070 align:middle line:90%
have any secret programs.

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:25.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So each level
is serving their master?

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well,
it's interesting.

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:30.620 align:middle line:84%
The topography of
this particular issue

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:37.070 align:middle line:84%
is still to be resolved,
but I'm on the job now.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:39.500 align:middle line:84%
This is what I did with
the Pentagon Papers stuff.

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:42.013 align:middle line:84%
This is what I did with
Karen Silkwood case.

00:42:42.013 --> 00:42:43.430 align:middle line:84%
is how we stopped
the construction

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:45.805 align:middle line:84%
of all private nuclear power
plants in the United States.

00:42:45.805 --> 00:42:47.780 align:middle line:84%
This is how we did
the Iran-Contra case

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:49.580 align:middle line:84%
to drill down and
find out about Oliver

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.140 align:middle line:90%
North and the whole operation.

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:52.555 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You've got
all the boring stuff.

00:42:52.555 --> 00:42:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah.

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:54.267 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the reasons why

00:42:54.267 --> 00:42:56.600 align:middle line:84%
I did the case that established
the right of journalists

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.460 align:middle line:84%
to protect our
confidential news sources,

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:00.410 align:middle line:84%
because that's so
important to be able to get

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:01.520 align:middle line:90%
at this kind of stuff.

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:05.690 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm doing now is
I'm trying to bring together

00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:10.400 align:middle line:84%
everyone who has an interest in
knowing what's really going on

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:11.420 align:middle line:90%
with the UFOS.

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Everybody who has a
legitimate interest

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:15.137 align:middle line:84%
in knowing who the
occupants are, everybody

00:43:15.137 --> 00:43:17.720 align:middle line:84%
who has a legitimate interest
in knowing what their agenda is,

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.860 align:middle line:90%
what they're up to here.

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Why is it they're not
telling us about themselves?

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:25.040 align:middle line:84%
That's a bit suspicious,
so what's really going on?

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And what we have is a community,
the so-called UFO community.

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is
not a community.

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:33.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, it's a--

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is so shattered.

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:36.950 align:middle line:90%
So much in-fighting.

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:38.117 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: But the reality--

00:43:38.117 --> 00:43:39.742 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Loosely
speaking, they're all

00:43:39.742 --> 00:43:41.250 align:middle line:90%
interested in the same thing.

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:43.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: They're all
interested in the same issues.

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And aside from the
turfing and ego problems

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:49.173 align:middle line:84%
that exist in almost any
organization of human beings--

00:43:49.173 --> 00:43:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:54.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: But the reality is
is that we have been devoted

00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:57.110 align:middle line:84%
for 75 years into trying
to convince people

00:43:57.110 --> 00:44:00.770 align:middle line:84%
that UFOs were real,
and convince people

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:03.200 align:middle line:90%
that they're extraterrestrial.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And so now we're
right on the brink

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:08.880 align:middle line:84%
of being able to get
that confirmed by what

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.180 align:middle line:84%
average people have been
trained to understand

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:13.093 align:middle line:90%
are authoritative sources.

00:44:13.093 --> 00:44:15.260 align:middle line:84%
One of which is the Defense
Department, one of which

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:16.260 align:middle line:90%
is the "New York Times."

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:18.305 align:middle line:84%
Another one is "60
Minutes" and CBS.

00:44:18.305 --> 00:44:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're in
the process of doing now

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.180 align:middle line:84%
is they're trying to get more
and more authoritative sources

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:26.540 align:middle line:84%
to come in behind Lue
Elizondo and Chris Mellon

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.430 align:middle line:84%
and the others, who are
trying to say, look,

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:33.270 align:middle line:84%
the time has come to get our
people of our planet educated

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:34.070 align:middle line:90%
about this.

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And we also have
the Catholic church.

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Strangely enough,
the Vatican has

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:41.750 align:middle line:84%
issued an official
public statement

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:44.720 align:middle line:84%
saying that in light of
the discovery of more

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:48.080 align:middle line:84%
and more of these
new exoplanets,

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.960 align:middle line:84%
the time has now arrived much
sooner than had been previously

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.680 align:middle line:84%
anticipated when we are going to
discover the existence of life

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:56.420 align:middle line:90%
elsewhere in the universe.

00:44:56.420 --> 00:45:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, that was a statement
issued on November 11th of 2009,

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:06.350 align:middle line:84%
some time ago, by Dr.
Jose Gabriel Funes, who

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:09.020 align:middle line:84%
was the director of the
observatory, the Pontifical

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:10.010 align:middle line:90%
Observatory.

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:12.350 align:middle line:84%
I, because of my
previous incarnation

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:14.630 align:middle line:84%
as the legal counsel of
the Jesuit Headquarters

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:16.730 align:middle line:84%
in the Social Ministry
office, I reached out

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:20.052 align:middle line:84%
to him and within 24 hours I was
sitting with him face to face.

00:45:20.052 --> 00:45:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And within the
first two minutes he

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:23.220 align:middle line:84%
confirmed to me
that well, we're not

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.680 align:middle line:84%
talking about just
discovering single cell

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.550 align:middle line:84%
life underneath some frozen lake
on some distant moon somewhere.

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:32.710 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
another highly intelligent,

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:35.790 align:middle line:84%
highly technologically
developed, but distinctly

00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:37.390 align:middle line:90%
non-human species.

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Right here
in our galaxy, OK.

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:42.870 align:middle line:90%
And now that is profound.

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And so that we have now
these various institutions,

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.230 align:middle line:84%
all of what you see though is
both the Defense Department

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:51.180 align:middle line:84%
and the Catholic
church are trying

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:54.930 align:middle line:84%
to ignore the entire
history of direct contact.

00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And thousands of people who
have had these contacts,

00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and who have sat with
the beings and had

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:01.710 align:middle line:90%
these different experiences.

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:03.360 align:middle line:84%
They call them
abduction experiences,

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.120 align:middle line:84%
but they've had direct
contact, face-to-face contact.

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And all the
institutions are trying

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.410 align:middle line:84%
to keep that away
right now, which

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:13.920 align:middle line:84%
means that there is
some combined will

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:17.040 align:middle line:84%
to conceal whatever
it is that's known

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:21.550 align:middle line:84%
about the agenda of the
extraterrestrial civilization.

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Because as I've said before,
they could come and just talk

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:27.090 align:middle line:84%
to us and tell us what they're
here for, but they aren't.

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
be, in my judgment,

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:35.680 align:middle line:84%
we need to be more circumspect
than many of the people who've

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:39.670 align:middle line:84%
been laboring in the
vineyard for 75 years,

00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:42.400 align:middle line:84%
those of us who are still
alive at that age, who

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.175 align:middle line:84%
have been saying oh look,
let's find out about the UFOs.

00:46:45.175 --> 00:46:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's prove that they're
extraterrestrial,

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:50.245 align:middle line:84%
and let's all just
assume they're OK.

00:46:50.245 --> 00:46:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's all assume they're
going to be helpful.

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's all assume they're
going to be friendly.

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And I have every hope in the
world of that being true.

00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:00.700 align:middle line:90%
I can absolutely guarantee that.

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:03.490 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm saying is
that we don't know yet.

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And what I, as a
lawyer, and having

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:09.580 align:middle line:84%
to prepare cases to
present to a court of law

00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:13.360 align:middle line:84%
and to present to a jury, I have
to exercise much greater care

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.310 align:middle line:84%
than just assuming
it's what I hold.

00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:17.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's true, you
can't speak off the cuff.

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: No you can't.

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:19.337 align:middle line:90%
You can't just make it up.

00:47:19.337 --> 00:47:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But most
of people involved,

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:24.580 align:middle line:84%
when you speak with them
privately, will say no,

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:26.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm not assuming these
people are a threat.

00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:28.900 align:middle line:84%
We just want to know
what's going on.

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:30.910 align:middle line:84%
When you speak to
others who study more

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:34.390 align:middle line:84%
from an ancient historical
perspective and Indigenous

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:36.410 align:middle line:84%
perspective, they've
always been here.

00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:38.530 align:middle line:84%
They've always been a
part of the culture.

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:40.580 align:middle line:84%
They've helped cultures
through difficult times.

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:41.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah.

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:43.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So to presume
that they're dangerous,

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:44.650 align:middle line:90%
that's the bad.

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's a bad thing.

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That would
be a bad thing.

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:47.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's a bad thing.

00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:50.405 align:middle line:84%
That's a bad thing, and that's a
function of a reactionary world

00:47:50.405 --> 00:47:51.205 align:middle line:90%
view.

00:47:51.205 --> 00:47:51.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That's being
trapped in the second chakra.

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And there's all kinds
of members of our human family

00:47:57.550 --> 00:48:02.080 align:middle line:84%
who are at differing levels
of conscious evolution.

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.290 align:middle line:84%
In that they all react
to the phenomenon

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:08.530 align:middle line:84%
from the particular chakra
that they're rooted in.

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have
to do is we have

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:13.360 align:middle line:84%
to address our people
ourselves to try

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.930 align:middle line:84%
to get some sort of a common
collective process underway.

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:16.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And that's what the
Catholic church said in 2009.

00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Because of this,
he said, the time

00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:27.610 align:middle line:84%
has now arrived to begin a
very serious conversation

00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:31.600 align:middle line:84%
among the citizens of
our planet to ascertain

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.960 align:middle line:84%
the answers to the profound
philosophical and theological

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:39.160 align:middle line:84%
questions that are posed to
us now with the discovery

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.380 align:middle line:84%
that we are not only
not in the center

00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:43.840 align:middle line:84%
of the physical universe,
we are no longer

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:47.530 align:middle line:84%
at the apex of a pyramid of
conscious life in the universe.

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:50.500 align:middle line:84%
The universe does
not exist as a stage

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:54.130 align:middle line:84%
upon which to play out the
drama of the evolution of one

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:58.240 align:middle line:84%
single species in the
universe, from primordial life

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.580 align:middle line:90%
up into starfury.

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:03.290 align:middle line:84%
That's not what the
universe is about.

00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have to
go through a process

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:11.360 align:middle line:84%
of a diminished sense of our
importance in the universe.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is a social
psychological process.

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is.

00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: We have to come
to grips with the people who

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:21.280 align:middle line:84%
are afraid of anything new
or different, who attempt

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:25.540 align:middle line:84%
to lash out with violence
and military repression,

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:27.020 align:middle line:90%
of anything like that.

00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:29.080 align:middle line:84%
There are a whole series
of factors that we

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.490 align:middle line:90%
have to take into account here.

00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:32.950 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
keep going forward.

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You do.

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: You can't
get stalled out on all

00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:36.440 align:middle line:84%
that oh, it's so complex
we can't figure out

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:36.640 align:middle line:90%
what we're doing here.

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.932 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, I agree with you.

00:49:37.932 --> 00:49:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And you take that kind of
that's what you're living for.

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.697 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is to take these
things on and take them forward

00:49:43.697 --> 00:49:44.768 align:middle line:90%
to some, not conclusion--

00:49:44.768 --> 00:49:45.685 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Resolution.

00:49:45.685 --> 00:49:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Resolution.

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Functional
resolution.

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:47.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So now, here you are.

00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:49.180 align:middle line:84%
The resolution,
quote, "The resolution

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:52.150 align:middle line:84%
from a public point of
view," happened on June 25,

00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:54.490 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was, when the
Pentagon put their statement

00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:58.840 align:middle line:84%
out, which was as I called
it a nondisclosure agreement.

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:01.510 align:middle line:84%
You said a nothing sandwich
is what a lot of people felt.

00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Nothing burger.

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nothing burger.

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like
a nothing burger.

00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Almost nothing was
acknowledged but one thing.

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: It didn't, until
you look at it a little more

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.600 align:middle line:90%
closely.

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:08.892 align:middle line:90%
If you look at it more closely.

00:50:08.892 --> 00:50:11.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the only
thing I saw, I saw one thing.

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:14.260 align:middle line:84%
OK, so yeah, we
looked at 144 cases.

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:15.520 align:middle line:90%
We can't explain 143 of them.

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:16.320 align:middle line:90%
Huh?

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:17.140 align:middle line:90%
What, what?

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:18.100 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole story.

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:19.390 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else mattered to me.

00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah.

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But to you,
what's actually going on?

00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: It's interesting.

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:24.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you're
coming from the inside.

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:26.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, the most
important thing to understand

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:31.030 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a classified
annex to that report, which

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:34.390 align:middle line:90%
is not 73 pages, but 400 pages.

00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:36.915 align:middle line:84%
There's a 400 page classified
annex to that report.

00:50:36.915 --> 00:50:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But yet, when do
we get to hear that one?

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:40.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well
by definition you

00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:44.680 align:middle line:84%
don't, unless we start treating
it like the Pentagon Papers.

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:45.823 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:50:45.823 --> 00:50:46.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: The reason that--

00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you going
for the gold, Danny?

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Well, the
reason the reason

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:51.940 align:middle line:84%
that we made the decision
at the "New York Times"

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:55.420 align:middle line:84%
to publish all 47 volumes
of the Pentagon Papers

00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:58.990 align:middle line:84%
is that we came to a conclusion,
which I was involved in,

00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:00.860 align:middle line:84%
that these were not
legitimately classified.

00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:04.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That this was the use
of the classification process

00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:10.600 align:middle line:84%
to conceal wrongdoing and
duplicity and dissembling.

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And so what we need
to do is we need

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:15.010 align:middle line:84%
to get a look at these 400
pages to really understand

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:19.480 align:middle line:84%
what percentage of
this is, if it is any,

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:23.080 align:middle line:84%
legitimately classified,
and why that would be.

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Which I tend to disagree
with unless you're

00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:28.810 align:middle line:84%
looking at how to make a
hydrogen bond or something.

00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:33.040 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
what's to be done

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:36.130 align:middle line:84%
if a substantial portion
of that information

00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:38.530 align:middle line:84%
is very much in the public
interest to know about.

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:40.837 align:middle line:84%
And that's what Lue
Elizondo and Chris Mellon

00:51:40.837 --> 00:51:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and the other people
that have been involved

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:46.180 align:middle line:84%
in this, a lot of them, are
very interested in trying

00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:48.400 align:middle line:90%
to discern that right now.

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's what's happening
at the present time.

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:55.210 align:middle line:84%
I am perceiving the
400 pages as being

00:51:55.210 --> 00:51:58.870 align:middle line:84%
something analogous to the 47
volumes of the Pentagon Papers.

00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:01.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm the one that was
one of the lawyers that

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:04.090 align:middle line:84%
engaged in the discussions
with Judge Murray Gurfein back

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:09.210 align:middle line:84%
in 1971 over the principles that
are operational in this area.

00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:11.975 align:middle line:84%
I've established some
relationships with people

00:52:11.975 --> 00:52:14.350 align:middle line:84%
in the "New York Times" to be
able to dialogue with them.

00:52:14.350 --> 00:52:17.780 align:middle line:84%
They know who I am and what
role I played at that time.

00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:20.878 align:middle line:84%
And so that set of
conversations has got to go on.

00:52:20.878 --> 00:52:22.670 align:middle line:84%
So there's a process
that's happening here.

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:26.065 align:middle line:84%
I'm not one that's going to
ground out just in process,

00:52:26.065 --> 00:52:29.230 align:middle line:84%
and say oh, well, this is
going to go on forever.

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:31.300 align:middle line:84%
We've got to maintain
the forward thrust

00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:34.490 align:middle line:84%
of this process of bringing
this information out.

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:36.020 align:middle line:84%
But we have to
stay focused also.

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:40.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm extraordinarily focused
on this issue of why is it

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:44.200 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrial beings
are not revealing themselves

00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.337 align:middle line:90%
in a different way?

00:52:45.337 --> 00:52:47.170 align:middle line:84%
They're quite clearly
revealing themselves--

00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, many people say
they are revealing themselves.

00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: They're,
I was going to say,

00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:51.790 align:middle line:84%
they're revealing themselves
in a particular way,

00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:55.160 align:middle line:84%
and there's this process
that's underway here.

00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And so those of us who may not
be as on the inside of what all

00:52:59.470 --> 00:53:02.200 align:middle line:84%
that's about, we keep saying
well, that's not the right way

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:03.225 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:53:03.225 --> 00:53:04.600 align:middle line:84%
You should just
come and tell us.

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:05.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And
what we need to do

00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:07.835 align:middle line:84%
is be more discerning
about that.

00:53:07.835 --> 00:53:11.740 align:middle line:84%
So I'll be engaged in
conversations with people

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:13.803 align:middle line:90%
like Cardinal Peter Turkson.

00:53:13.803 --> 00:53:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Cardinal Peter Turkson is
the head of the Pontifical

00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:17.620 align:middle line:90%
Commission on Social Justice.

00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:20.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole social justice
dimension to this whole thing.

00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:22.450 align:middle line:90%
He's number two to Francis.

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:25.672 align:middle line:84%
Francis is the first Jesuit
who's ever been made a pope,

00:53:25.672 --> 00:53:27.880 align:middle line:84%
so we have a certain lines
of communication with him.

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:31.090 align:middle line:84%
I get to stay at the doma
there in Rome when I'm there.

00:53:31.090 --> 00:53:32.770 align:middle line:90%
That's where Francis lives.

00:53:32.770 --> 00:53:36.310 align:middle line:84%
We have dinner together
in the same room.

00:53:36.310 --> 00:53:39.190 align:middle line:84%
We've got some potential
access to that discussion.

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:40.990 align:middle line:84%
We've got access to
the Defense Department

00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:42.328 align:middle line:90%
now in representing Lue.

00:53:42.328 --> 00:53:44.620 align:middle line:84%
We sit down with the Inspector
General's staff monthly.

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
basically setting

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:50.140 align:middle line:84%
the stage and your place at
the table, along with others,

00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:52.840 align:middle line:84%
to move forward to
not become overwhelmed

00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:54.160 align:middle line:90%
with the enormity of the task?

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:56.210 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely right.

00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:58.100 align:middle line:90%
And this has to be done.

00:53:58.100 --> 00:53:59.905 align:middle line:84%
It has to be done
now, because we're--

00:53:59.905 --> 00:54:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Carefully,
responsibly.

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Very
carefully, in the same way

00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:05.433 align:middle line:84%
that we're working on the
global climate change problem.

00:54:05.433 --> 00:54:08.540 align:middle line:84%
Our office in California is
drafting the California Green

00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:09.340 align:middle line:90%
New Deal.

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:11.650 align:middle line:90%
We have a 350 page draft bill.

00:54:11.650 --> 00:54:12.910 align:middle line:90%
We have a 50 page summary.

00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:14.600 align:middle line:84%
We're in meetings
with John Laird, who's

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:15.820 align:middle line:90%
the top guy in the Senate.

00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:18.520 align:middle line:84%
We're meeting with Rob
Rivas in the State Assembly.

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:20.920 align:middle line:84%
We're working on getting the
legislation pushed forward.

00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:22.780 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with
Governor Newsom.

00:54:22.780 --> 00:54:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: He's got
his recall going on.

00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:26.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
not going to happen.

00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: We're trying
to-- that's right.

00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to get
him to establish a climate

00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:34.120 align:middle line:84%
emergency in California, because
the place is burning down

00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:34.945 align:middle line:90%
around their ears.

00:54:34.945 --> 00:54:35.745 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:54:35.745 --> 00:54:37.780 align:middle line:84%
116 in Sacramento on
the road the other day.

00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah.

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:38.580 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Never seen
anything like it.

00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: So what
I'm saying is,

00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:44.920 align:middle line:84%
that we're dealing we're dealing
with two major events, two

00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:45.860 align:middle line:90%
huge major events.

00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:46.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Huge.

00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:49.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: That the threat
in global climate change

00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:52.180 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most catastrophic
events in the history

00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:53.530 align:middle line:90%
of our human family.

00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:56.740 align:middle line:84%
It's analogous to the
crashing of the asteroid that

00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:58.180 align:middle line:90%
wiped out the dinosaurs.

00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:01.395 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is threatening
human civilization itself,

00:55:01.395 --> 00:55:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and people are
not aware of that.

00:55:02.770 --> 00:55:04.312 align:middle line:84%
No matter how many
times they've been

00:55:04.312 --> 00:55:09.280 align:middle line:84%
told the ice caps are melting,
billions of tons of water

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.850 align:middle line:84%
every day pouring into the
oceans, and the dissolving

00:55:12.850 --> 00:55:15.820 align:middle line:84%
of our ice caps, the
lowering of the salination

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:18.190 align:middle line:84%
levels in the ocean, the
lowering of the density

00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:20.980 align:middle line:84%
of the water, threatening to
have the underwater currents,

00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:23.170 align:middle line:84%
the warm water currents
rise and dissipate.

00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:26.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're looking at
huge planetary catastrophe

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.413 align:middle line:90%
coming down the line here.

00:55:28.413 --> 00:55:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Some of it is not
even going to be

00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:32.110 align:middle line:84%
able to be avoided
this late in the game.

00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:34.780 align:middle line:84%
We have to start getting
prepared for that, OK.

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:39.400 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, we have this
major uptick in the visitation

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.640 align:middle line:90%
of these UFOs that are coming.

00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:46.570 align:middle line:84%
There was an entire carrier
group tasked out in the Pacific

00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:51.423 align:middle line:84%
Ocean off Baja, the USS Nimitz,
to monitor these things coming

00:55:51.423 --> 00:55:52.590 align:middle line:90%
and going, coming and going.

00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:54.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and this is not
coincidental I've interviewed

00:55:54.490 --> 00:55:56.260 align:middle line:84%
many people over
the last 20 years

00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:57.850 align:middle line:84%
who have said they've
had visitations,

00:55:57.850 --> 00:55:59.267 align:middle line:84%
and they're always
shown something

00:55:59.267 --> 00:56:01.030 align:middle line:90%
of an ecological nature.

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:02.250 align:middle line:90%
Over and over, be aware.

00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:04.833 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Understand
what's happening.

00:56:04.833 --> 00:56:07.850 align:middle line:84%
They're always projecting
these pictures into the--

00:56:07.850 --> 00:56:09.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: The
two major warnings

00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:11.740 align:middle line:84%
that have been conveyed
consistently, you've

00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:13.420 align:middle line:84%
got to get rid of
the nuclear weapons.

00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And
private nuclear power.

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Because of the rising sea levels
you're going to have dozens

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:19.670 align:middle line:90%
of Fukuyama's.

00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:23.000 align:middle line:84%
There's over 200
nuclear power stations

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.850 align:middle line:84%
all within one mile of the
sea coast around the world.

00:56:25.850 --> 00:56:28.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and with the
rising global sea levels--

00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You got to back up and
look at the big picture here.

00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:31.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: You've got to
look at the big picture.

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.740 align:middle line:84%
So that is going
on at the same time

00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:37.470 align:middle line:84%
this major new uptick in these
visitations are going on.

00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: These are two of
the most important events that

00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:42.590 align:middle line:84%
have ever happened in the entire
history of our human family.

00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:43.110 --> 00:56:45.152 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And they don't
appear to be unrelated.

00:56:45.152 --> 00:56:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And so
what we have to do

00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:50.030 align:middle line:84%
is move very cautiously
on this, but we

00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:52.920 align:middle line:84%
have to move with
expedition on this.

00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:54.860 align:middle line:84%
We can't sit around
and twiddle our thumbs

00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:57.800 align:middle line:84%
and wait for government to
solve these things for us.

00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:01.040 align:middle line:84%
That's why the whole citizens'
initiative is so important.

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And Steven Greer has
played a very vital role

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:04.790 align:middle line:90%
in this with his CE5.

00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Mark Sims is in the process now
of generating this new paradigm

00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:10.250 align:middle line:84%
institute, a virtual
new paradigm institute

00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:12.650 align:middle line:84%
to gather people together,
the world experts together

00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:14.250 align:middle line:84%
to talk about all
of these things

00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:16.980 align:middle line:84%
so they don't have to fly them
in and put them up and feed

00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:17.780 align:middle line:90%
them all.

00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:18.580 align:middle line:90%
This is the--

00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:20.163 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's one thing COVID

00:57:20.163 --> 00:57:21.530 align:middle line:90%
gave us is virtual gatherings.

00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah,
well, and Mark is now

00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:27.920 align:middle line:84%
financing and putting together
this the virtual new paradigm

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:28.820 align:middle line:90%
institute.

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:31.070 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be able to
bring people to sit actually

00:57:31.070 --> 00:57:33.173 align:middle line:84%
literally at a table
together from any place

00:57:33.173 --> 00:57:34.340 align:middle line:90%
in the world, come together.

00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
you and I were part

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:36.800 align:middle line:84%
of that with something
called the observation deck.

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Yeah, that's right.

00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's amazing
new technology.

00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: That's right.

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.822 align:middle line:90%
And Mark has just purchased.

00:57:39.822 --> 00:57:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yes, amazing.

00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And he's
going to gin that up

00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:44.480 align:middle line:90%
into a whole new generation.

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's exciting.

00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:47.427 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: And we're going
to gather people starting

00:57:47.427 --> 00:57:51.980 align:middle line:84%
on the 18th of August
through the 22nd of August,

00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:54.230 align:middle line:84%
major players to
bring to the table

00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:57.170 align:middle line:84%
to discuss the
philosophical implications,

00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:59.270 align:middle line:84%
the theological
implications of this.

00:57:59.270 --> 00:58:02.540 align:middle line:84%
What are the
cosmological implications

00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:05.310 align:middle line:90%
and the onological implications.

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:07.880 align:middle line:84%
These are all sophisticated
subcomponent elements

00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:08.900 align:middle line:90%
of a philosophy.

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:12.060 align:middle line:84%
We have to develop a new
paradigm human worldview.

00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:12.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We do.

00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:15.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: A new post
contact human worldview

00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:18.350 align:middle line:84%
to integrate ourselves
into the greater community.

00:58:18.350 --> 00:58:20.343 align:middle line:84%
We have to be
cognizant of the fact

00:58:20.343 --> 00:58:22.760 align:middle line:84%
that there are questions that
we don't know the answer to.

00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Very importantly, we need to
be careful about speculating

00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:29.997 align:middle line:84%
wildly about answers, and
then convincing ourselves

00:58:29.997 --> 00:58:30.830 align:middle line:90%
that those are true.

00:58:30.830 --> 00:58:31.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: When it's
just a speculation.

00:58:32.930 --> 00:58:35.360 align:middle line:84%
We need to figure out what
all the different options are

00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:38.090 align:middle line:84%
and explore the probabilities
of each of them,

00:58:38.090 --> 00:58:42.260 align:middle line:84%
and try to go forward with a
careful decision tree analysis,

00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:44.300 align:middle line:84%
applying Bayes' theorem
to the probabilities

00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:46.700 align:middle line:84%
so that we can come to
some logical conclusions

00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:49.700 align:middle line:84%
about the next steps
we need to take.

00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:51.560 align:middle line:90%
All that's going on now.

00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:54.350 align:middle line:84%
We have to stop bickering
among ourselves about this.

00:58:54.350 --> 00:58:58.100 align:middle line:84%
We have to have people
not attacking each other.

00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:01.970 align:middle line:84%
I know that a lot of
people who have been out

00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:07.190 align:middle line:84%
in the wasteland for 50
years are resentful of people

00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:09.800 align:middle line:84%
who come from inside the
National Security Bureaucracy

00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:11.930 align:middle line:84%
that they haven't
told us earlier,

00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and they must still be engaged
in some nefarious kind of-- we

00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:17.180 align:middle line:84%
have to try to step
back a little bit

00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:18.950 align:middle line:90%
and be grown ups about this.

00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:24.140 align:middle line:84%
We're not kids in a schoolyard
anymore arguing about who's

00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:26.540 align:middle line:90%
going to get the basketball.

00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:27.575 align:middle line:90%
We've got to back up.

00:59:27.575 --> 00:59:28.700 align:middle line:90%
We've got to join together.

00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:32.630 align:middle line:84%
We've got to form a major
coalition, first within the UFO

00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:36.590 align:middle line:84%
community, and then with
people that have come out

00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:39.290 align:middle line:84%
of the National Security
State Bureaucracy

00:59:39.290 --> 00:59:42.160 align:middle line:84%
to evaluate whether or
not they're credible.

00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:44.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm playing some role in that.

00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:46.610 align:middle line:84%
I believe Lue Elizondo
to be incredible.

00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:50.600 align:middle line:90%
I believe Chris to be credible.

00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:52.993 align:middle line:84%
I believe Eric Davis
to be credible.

00:59:52.993 --> 00:59:54.410 align:middle line:84%
There are some of
these people I'm

00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:56.900 align:middle line:84%
starting to encounter now to
determine how credible they

00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:57.700 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:59:57.700 --> 00:59:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Now a lot of them
have to get over

00:59:59.750 --> 01:00:02.488 align:middle line:84%
the habit of being
secretive about--

01:00:02.488 --> 01:00:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, they do because
that makes people suspicious.

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: Because
that's their life.

01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:06.800 align:middle line:90%
It makes people suspicious.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're going to
assign the worst value to them.

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:09.897 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Absolutely right.

01:00:09.897 --> 01:00:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And so everybody
has to be grown ups

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.700 align:middle line:84%
about understanding
what people believe

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:15.980 align:middle line:84%
or what they think about
things so that there's

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.880 align:middle line:84%
a sophisticated
process going on.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.160 align:middle line:90%
But all of this is training.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:23.090 align:middle line:84%
All of this is
training to qualify

01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:25.700 align:middle line:84%
to have direct communication
with the extraterrestrial

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:26.540 align:middle line:90%
beings.

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, as Larry the
Cable Guy would say,

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:31.345 align:middle line:84%
it's time to put our
big boy underbritches on

01:00:31.345 --> 01:00:33.320 align:middle line:90%
and big girl underbritches on.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's true, maturity,
we're not there yet.

01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:37.880 align:middle line:84%
But I really appreciate
the due diligence

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.830 align:middle line:84%
that you bring to
the planet, really,

01:00:39.830 --> 01:00:43.670 align:middle line:84%
and constantly pursuing these
values and seeing them through.

01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Because you're really
oftentimes the glue

01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:49.260 align:middle line:84%
that holds us together when so
many parties could fall apart.

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:51.980 align:middle line:84%
So I just thank you for
your lifelong dedication

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:54.590 align:middle line:84%
to this, and to
disclosure itself, no less

01:00:54.590 --> 01:00:55.850 align:middle line:90%
the rest of what you've done.

01:00:55.850 --> 01:00:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: So far, so good.

01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:59.488 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any final thought
before we sign off here, Danny?

01:00:59.488 --> 01:01:02.060 align:middle line:10%
>>SHEEHAN: Just keep
your eye on the skies.

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:04.940 align:middle line:10%
Reach out, try to establish
direct communication

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.380 align:middle line:10%
with the extraterrestrial
beings themselves.

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:09.770 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to rely upon
our government institutions

01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:11.437 align:middle line:84%
to tell us what's
true, what's not true.

01:01:11.437 --> 01:01:13.062 align:middle line:84%
They've got a bad
track record on that.

01:01:13.062 --> 01:01:14.812 align:middle line:84%
We've got to find out
the truth ourselves.

01:01:14.812 --> 01:01:16.837 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, CE group
is a good way to go.

01:01:16.837 --> 01:01:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: CE5 is
the right way to go.

01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, CE5.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:19.860 align:middle line:90%
I've done that.

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:20.790 align:middle line:90%
I've been out there.

01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: It's the
right way to go.

01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:22.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
fascinating what I saw.

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:23.340 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:24.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SHEEHAN: It's the
right way to go.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's the way to go.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Take the responsibility
ourselves.

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Put our big boy,
big girl undies on.

01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:30.610 align:middle line:90%
OK, thank you so much.

01:01:30.610 --> 01:01:31.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:01:31.410 --> 01:01:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Terrific.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So wonderful to
sit with you again, Danny.

01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SHEEHAN: Thank you, Meredith.

01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:34.350 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:01:34.350 --> 01:01:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Always a pleasure
having Danny Sheehan with us.

01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:38.550 align:middle line:10%
To look deeper into the
mission of Danny's work

01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:40.380 align:middle line:10%
you'll find an
illuminating body of work

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:42.450 align:middle line:10%
at newparadigminstitute.org.

01:01:42.450 --> 01:01:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:52.000 align:middle line:90%
