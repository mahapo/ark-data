>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Why the Sphinx?

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.920 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.840 align:middle line:90%
Were you looking for something?

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Somebody with
this name of three

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.450 align:middle line:84%
knows information
about the Sphinx.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.610 align:middle line:84%
It was an
extraterrestrial presence

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.150 align:middle line:84%
that would come down on Earth to
try to help humanity before it

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.310 align:middle line:90%
destroyed one another.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Much of the evidence
in many of the Great Pyramids

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.570 align:middle line:84%
are long buried under
the sand, and we have yet

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:90%
to rediscover them.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.390 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.690 align:middle line:90%
It holds our true history.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.823 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: The Sphinx.

00:00:39.823 --> 00:00:44.300 align:middle line:84%
This Sphinx was being built
on this very special rock.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.340 align:middle line:90%
It had like a generator almost.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.640 align:middle line:84%
It was a very special rock that
came almost like an asteroid

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.000 align:middle line:84%
from a different planet,
and it's basically

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.310 align:middle line:90%
an extraterrestrial presence.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
this different voice

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.070 align:middle line:84%
came through Yana and said, we
have to interrupt this session

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.880 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.910 align:middle line:84%

>>REGINA: I've been
saying for years

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.090 align:middle line:84%
that it's going to take the
work of talented, intuitive, and

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.050 align:middle line:84%
hypnotherapy subjects to flesh
out our real human history.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Artifacts on the
ground are not enough.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.500 align:middle line:90%
We need deep memory.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Sarah Breskman Cosme's work
is key in working together

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.940 align:middle line:90%
toward this end.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.510 align:middle line:10%
I previously interviewed her
here on "A Hypnotist's Journey

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.410 align:middle line:10%
to Atlantis."

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to go
to the mysterious Sphinx.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.240 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Sarah.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Thank you so
much for having me.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.592 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's good
to see you again.

00:01:37.592 --> 00:01:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And I read the new book, loved
it, just like the previous one.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And I have such respect for
the way this is happening.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Before we go any further
and into this story--

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.930 align:middle line:90%
and there's a lot here--

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.660 align:middle line:84%
did you ever guess when
you became a hypnotherapist

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.190 align:middle line:84%
that you were going to
end up in this position?

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Never.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.480 align:middle line:10%
I had no idea at all that
this would ever happen to me.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.250 align:middle line:90%
It was such a wild ride.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
because you were trying

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.889 align:middle line:84%
to help people overcome some
of our poor habits in life

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.830 align:middle line:84%
and get better sleep and
lose weight and all that,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.010 align:middle line:84%
and here we are talking about
Atlantis and the Sphinx.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: I know.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.720 align:middle line:90%
It's just incredible.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.628 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:02:18.628 --> 00:02:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
just started popping

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.450 align:middle line:84%
through the most
unlikely sources that

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.400 align:middle line:90%
really had no interest.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Same is going to go for
today's story, by the way.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.248 align:middle line:84%
That had no interest in these
subjects and no knowledge.

00:02:31.248 --> 00:02:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: I had such a
different background.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.250 align:middle line:84%
I had a scientific background,
so I got into all of this stuff

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.683 align:middle line:90%
by accident.

00:02:37.683 --> 00:02:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yep, and
one of them was

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Jen Sullivan, who she's carrying
forward into this story.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.940 align:middle line:84%
But we also have a
couple of other people

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.680 align:middle line:84%
that you were working with whose
stories start crossing over.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.920 align:middle line:10%
And I think it seems
that Jen shows up

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.050 align:middle line:10%
so prominently because she's
really lucid and very easy to--

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.340 align:middle line:10%
very easy for her to
reflect back information

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.140 align:middle line:10%
that she's seeing, and
it's very detailed.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.910 align:middle line:10%
She's a really good subject.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: She's
such a good subject

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.960 align:middle line:84%
because she doesn't
know about this stuff.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.700 align:middle line:84%
She didn't know
about this at all.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.240 align:middle line:84%
She was a teacher at the school
where my kids went to school,

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.300 align:middle line:84%
and I knew that she didn't
know anything about this stuff

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.640 align:middle line:84%
because we were
friends for 10 years.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And I would try to
bring up little things--

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.465 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:21.465 --> 00:03:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Here and there
about spirituality,

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.550 align:middle line:84%
but she wasn't into
any of that stuff.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's why she was just
such a fantastic subject

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.100 align:middle line:84%
because I know that she didn't
know this stuff previously.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, just as you
had not known it previously.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Until you started
writing bumping into it

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.590 align:middle line:84%
and getting some
exposure along the way.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.480 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, we already know
what happened with Atlantis.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who wants to watch can go
back and look at that interview

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.230 align:middle line:84%
I did with you on Atlantis,
so kind of sets this up.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.340 align:middle line:90%
Why the Sphinx?

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.450 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Were you looking for
something, or what happened?

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: You know, I
never lead these sessions,

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
makes it so exciting.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't write these books.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.200 align:middle line:84%
These books are written by
the higher consciousness

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.790 align:middle line:84%
that comes through
my clients when

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.530 align:middle line:90%
they're deep under hypnosis.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.420 align:middle line:90%
So there's an agenda there.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.850 align:middle line:84%
There's information that
these higher consciousness

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.190 align:middle line:84%
want to get out,
and I had no idea

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.450 align:middle line:90%
it would be about the Sphinx.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Everything just kept
leading us to the Sphinx,

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and it was so exciting to learn
all this amazing information.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is, and we're
going to get into that.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.730 align:middle line:90%
But I feel inclined--

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.980 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't planning on it,
but I feel inclined to say,

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.150 align:middle line:84%
you and I did our own
session yesterday.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
was you and I were

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.610 align:middle line:84%
talking on the phone
just prep for this,

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.300 align:middle line:84%
and I suddenly
got this hit, gee,

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:84%
I haven't had a regression
since Dolores Cannon now 22

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:44.920 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.298 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I should have
Sarah regress me.

00:04:47.298 --> 00:04:48.590 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have anything in mind.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.110 align:middle line:90%
It just hit me out of nowhere.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.317 align:middle line:84%
So I said, Sarah,
how would you feel

00:04:52.317 --> 00:04:54.400 align:middle line:84%
about doing a regression
when you come to Boulder.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And you started
laughing because--

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Because the day before
my regression subject said,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Delores just came
through and said,

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.670 align:middle line:84%
you've got to see if
you can regress Regina.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what was so funny
was that we did the regression,

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.800 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have
any expectation.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.020 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing
specific I wanted to see.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out,
I really think

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:84%
that was Dolores guiding
that entire thing because it

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.570 align:middle line:84%
was more information that
ties these stories together

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.633 align:middle line:90%
on a lot of levels.

00:05:23.633 --> 00:05:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Gave you
the goose bumps.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it definitely
ties it all together.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, so a bunch
of information flowed out.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And some of it I was aware of,
some of it I was not aware of,

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.410 align:middle line:84%
and some of it I can't
remember right now.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.560 align:middle line:84%
But it just showed that
these other forces--

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.578 align:middle line:84%
and Dolores is not
embodied right now.

00:05:40.578 --> 00:05:42.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure she's here
with us at this moment.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.110 align:middle line:90%
She passed away a few years ago.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And she wanted to see
that certain information

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.980 align:middle line:84%
that certain people
hold comes forward.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.250 align:middle line:84%
So in say, Jen's case,
she might come forward

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.350 align:middle line:84%
because she wants to
work on whatever issue

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.380 align:middle line:84%
she came to you for, not
knowing that she's being

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.730 align:middle line:90%
guided from the other side.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And I will say, when
you're doing a session,

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.465 align:middle line:84%
you're not asking
leading questions at all.

00:06:02.465 --> 00:06:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yeah, never.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
nothing leading.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:90%
There's no subject matter.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.393 align:middle line:84%
It all has to come
out of the being.

00:06:08.393 --> 00:06:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And that's why I
really didn't write these books.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.585 align:middle line:90%
I'm just the humble messenger.

00:06:12.585 --> 00:06:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, you
just edit them together,

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.730 align:middle line:90%
put a nice cover on them.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.310 align:middle line:84%
OK, so first of all,
another thing that

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.190 align:middle line:84%
kept coming out of clients
is they kept saying,

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.310 align:middle line:90%
someone named Three is here.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And at other times the word
"thrice" and "Hermes" came up.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out
that this was Thoth.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Now Thoth is an
archetypal entity who

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:40.060 align:middle line:84%
as the scribe from the
Egyptian gods and culture.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:84%
You didn't know
anything about Thoth.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.750 align:middle line:90%
They didn't.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting,
thrice trismegistus,

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.230 align:middle line:90%
which is thrice, thrice, Thoth.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.000 align:middle line:84%
So in three different
incarnations.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.648 align:middle line:84%
So Thoth is three times
this entity incarnating

00:06:55.648 --> 00:06:56.690 align:middle line:90%
three different entities.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's known as
thrice trismegistus,

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.928 align:middle line:84%
and he just shortened it-- he
just shortened it to three.

00:07:01.928 --> 00:07:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Because they wouldn't even
be able to pronounce--

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.020 align:middle line:90%
I can barely pronounce it.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.320 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.778 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'm not
pronouncing it right.

00:07:06.778 --> 00:07:12.190 align:middle line:84%
But he came through and
gave a simplification

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.650 align:middle line:84%
of what he's known as
to each of these people,

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.990 align:middle line:84%
and they're seeing this entity
calling themselves three.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.790 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: And when--

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With ancient
Egyptian knowledge.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.710 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: We didn't know
anything about thrice--

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:24.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Trismegistus.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, OK.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And nobody's heard of
this, none of my subjects had.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.450 align:middle line:84%
But they kept saying, somebody
with this name of Three

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.970 align:middle line:84%
knows information
about the Sphinx,

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.250 align:middle line:84%
and multiple clients
kept saying that.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, that's a
really strange name, Three.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Why do you call
this being Three?

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And they said because this
being doesn't go by he or she.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.200 align:middle line:84%
It's androgynous,
and it's basically

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.900 align:middle line:90%
an extraterrestrial presence.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you
could say that, yeah.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So here is Thoth, who
is the great scribe

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:84%
throughout Egyptian history,
and one might argue even

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.480 align:middle line:84%
into Atlantean history,
coming to share

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.810 align:middle line:84%
through innocent people
information that has

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.870 align:middle line:90%
been withheld from humanity.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Right, because
the time is right for it

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.900 align:middle line:90%
to come back to humanity.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
go to Jen first,

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.210 align:middle line:84%
and Jen was the
primary subject we were

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.500 align:middle line:90%
speaking about a moment ago.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And she was talking about when
she started looking at it,

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.130 align:middle line:84%
she said, it was an
outpost, so let's talk

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.789 align:middle line:84%
about where she was,
what she was looking at,

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:36.880 align:middle line:84%
where it was an outpost from,
and what she started seeing.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.559 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So I was
regressing Jen,

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.929 align:middle line:84%
and I took her back to
that lifetime in the '70s,

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:43.360 align:middle line:84%
or that's where her higher
self brought her to.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.095 align:middle line:84%
And we were finding
out information

00:08:45.095 --> 00:08:45.970 align:middle line:90%
about that lifetime--

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where she
committed suicide,

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.090 align:middle line:84%
was putting in an
insane asylum basically.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Jumped off a bridge when
she got out for a minute.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.137 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she came back
not too long after that.

00:08:54.137 --> 00:08:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right, exactly.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And back during
that lifetime, she

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.580 align:middle line:84%
had been regressed earlier
by a different hypnotist.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And during that time, they
were uncovering information.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And some of this information
that they uncovered

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:08.840 align:middle line:84%
was about the Sphinx, and we
didn't know this previously.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.470 align:middle line:84%
But as I was regressing
her, she realized this.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And she went to the time
where she saw it being built,

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:19.420 align:middle line:84%
and she saw from an
observer point of view

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:24.220 align:middle line:84%
that this Sphinx was being
built on this very special rock.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.290 align:middle line:90%
It had like a generator almost.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.560 align:middle line:84%
It was a very special rock that
came almost like an asteroid

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.060 align:middle line:90%
from a different planet.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't know
exactly where it was,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.070 align:middle line:84%
but this was a very special
rock because it could harness

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.930 align:middle line:90%
and hold and magnetize energy.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And so the colonizers
that came to this planet

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.100 align:middle line:84%
chose that rock to
build the Sphinx on it

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.160 align:middle line:84%
because they knew it could
act as a time capsule,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.670 align:middle line:84%
a generator almost to keep
certain things active so

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.590 align:middle line:84%
that they could have
it stored there.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And when Jen was
seeing it being built,

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.480 align:middle line:84%
she saw that the
extraterrestrials that built it

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.150 align:middle line:84%
didn't have bodies at the
time because they didn't

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:02.980 align:middle line:90%
need to interact with humans.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
interesting because

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.900 align:middle line:84%
many different
extraterrestrials will say,

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:11.290 align:middle line:84%
they don't need a body unless
they're interacting with humans

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:15.220 align:middle line:84%
or unless they're going to
be on this Earth for a while.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.100 align:middle line:84%
So at the time, it was easier
for them to build the Sphinx,

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and they use these laser-like
tools to chisel out the Sphinx.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time was spent
digging the tunnels underneath.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.400 align:middle line:84%
It was a short amount
of time for them

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:32.080 align:middle line:84%
to build the jungle,
catlike facade on top

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.435 align:middle line:90%
that now looks different.

00:10:33.435 --> 00:10:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
she almost called

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.060 align:middle line:90%
it a kind of human hard drive.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.350 align:middle line:84%
So it has our human
history in it.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: It does.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.150 align:middle line:90%
It has our full history.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it also appears
to have our human future in it.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:45.680 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: It does.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.231 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In terms of what
we're capable of, what we are,

00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:53.020 align:middle line:84%
what we were
hybridized from, right?

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.180 align:middle line:90%
It holds our true history.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: In this Sphinx.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And it broadcasts
out, so everything

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:03.840 align:middle line:84%
that's happening around us today
is being stored in the Sphinx

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.760 align:middle line:84%
and broadcast out
to other planets

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.600 align:middle line:90%
so they can keep track of us.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it wasn't
just she, but others also--

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:10.005 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Others.

00:11:10.005 --> 00:11:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Also saw the
same function happening.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.100 align:middle line:84%
But you touched on
something there,

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:18.030 align:middle line:84%
and I found it interesting
in the book was the tunneling

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.200 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Because she went on to say--
she also spoke of Antarctica

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:27.360 align:middle line:84%
and said that was really one
of the cradles of civilization

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.630 align:middle line:84%
where she and her people,
from wherever they came from,

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.770 align:middle line:90%
were colonizing.

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.730 align:middle line:84%
They were doing that in the
Antarctica area, Arctic area.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And she said throughout
all over the Earth

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.820 align:middle line:90%
are massive tunnel systems.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:42.898 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh definitely.

00:11:42.898 --> 00:11:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us about
the tunnel systems.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Well--

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.345 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How she
described them.

00:11:46.345 --> 00:11:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: She described--
especially the ones that

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.190 align:middle line:90%
were underneath the Sphinx.

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:53.790 align:middle line:84%
They went from large
and boxy to small--

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.560 align:middle line:90%
not small, but narrow.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.440 align:middle line:84%
So basically it would create
something within the mind

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.790 align:middle line:90%
when you would go through them.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:03.600 align:middle line:84%
It would create almost
like a transcendence.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.150 align:middle line:84%
This feeling of going
from a wide area

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.180 align:middle line:90%
into this small narrow spot.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was basically,
what it was supposed

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.240 align:middle line:84%
to do is to go from the
scattering of the mind

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.690 align:middle line:84%
into focus, to bring you back to
that state where you can really

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:90%
focus and get information.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.350 align:middle line:84%
It was all done for a
very specific purpose.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:22.110 align:middle line:84%
But there were
also tunnel systems

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.390 align:middle line:84%
built all over throughout the
Earth before the Ice Age--

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:26.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Under the oceans.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.320 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Mm-hmm.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.290 align:middle line:90%
Before the Ice Age.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And during that time,
before the Ice Age,

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.160 align:middle line:90%
there was a lot of warning.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And so the extraterrestrials
that were seeding this planet

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:40.200 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to lose their
experiment, so they came down

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.355 align:middle line:84%
and they helped everybody build
these tunnels intricately.

00:12:43.355 --> 00:12:45.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's many other
reasons for the tunnels,

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.740 align:middle line:90%
but that's one of them.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.282 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are some of the
other reasons for the tunnels?

00:12:49.282 --> 00:12:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Oh my gosh,
well, I've heard

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.350 align:middle line:84%
they were different
joining mechanisms

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:55.850 align:middle line:84%
for different
extraterrestrials that

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:57.800 align:middle line:90%
would inhabit the Inner Earth.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And so they would
use the tunnels

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.960 align:middle line:84%
as a way of meeting up with
one another and going to--

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.853 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Perhaps civilizations
or tribes of people.

00:13:05.853 --> 00:13:06.770 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right, right.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.240 align:middle line:90%
So they could go unnoticed.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Also another reason
for the tunnel systems

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.090 align:middle line:84%
were for extraterrestrials
to work on the soil.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Because it was said that if
they didn't, we wouldn't really

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.710 align:middle line:90%
be able to live here.

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:23.363 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so the
different experiences--

00:13:23.363 --> 00:13:25.280 align:middle line:84%
each of these people had
different experiences

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.750 align:middle line:90%
of the tunnel system.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And as you pointed to a
moment ago, one of them

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:33.560 align:middle line:84%
included what happened when
humans had to go underground

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.760 align:middle line:90%
during the Ice Age.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk from
memory, if you can,

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.300 align:middle line:84%
because there's so
much information--

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't like to
throw things at you

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:41.660 align:middle line:84%
because you have to
go into your data bank

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and remember what someone said--
but can you explain what it was

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:49.010 align:middle line:84%
like for the people that had
to go underground during an Ice

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:50.510 align:middle line:90%
Age, how they lived?

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Because they were assisted
by ET technologies

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.330 align:middle line:84%
for physical
survival as I recall.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well you know,
it was interesting

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.900 align:middle line:84%
because there was a lot
of revolting going on

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.610 align:middle line:84%
because some people just wanted
to go back to the surface

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:06.890 align:middle line:84%
but they couldn't, so there
was a huge divide in the minds

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:08.430 align:middle line:90%
of the people at the time.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And then when they finally
could come to the surface,

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:14.360 align:middle line:84%
some didn't want to
and some have stayed.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, so
there's still humans

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.290 align:middle line:90%
in those tunnels living there?

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:18.290 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, definitely.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But as I
recall, some of them

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:22.230 align:middle line:84%
became weakened and
did not make it.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what was that
a result of, as you recall?

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Just from
lack of sunlight,

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.660 align:middle line:84%
and they couldn't
really do very much.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.610 align:middle line:84%
There was this specific
thing that they

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.250 align:middle line:84%
would do to create energy
within the tunnels.

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.370 align:middle line:84%
They would make
these big circles

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:40.950 align:middle line:84%
and just try to run in
one circle many times,

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and it would create
like a type of energy

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.450 align:middle line:84%
that they would try to
bathe themselves in.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.692 align:middle line:84%
And then some really enjoyed
to just sit in the crevices

00:14:48.692 --> 00:14:50.150 align:middle line:84%
deep in the tunnels,
and they would

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.040 align:middle line:90%
feel the energy of the Earth.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.710 align:middle line:84%
My subjects all had
different experiences

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.860 align:middle line:84%
during this time, the ones that
remembered this experience deep

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.745 align:middle line:90%
under hypnosis.

00:14:59.745 --> 00:15:02.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All in all, it wasn't
a particularly satisfying

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.050 align:middle line:90%
experience for them.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.400 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: I don't
want to remember it.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
I'm thinking-- yeah,

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:09.890 align:middle line:84%
interesting why anyone would
even choose to incarnate during

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:10.887 align:middle line:90%
those times where--

00:15:10.887 --> 00:15:13.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's always something
to learn, something new

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.220 align:middle line:90%
if you're an adventurer.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.430 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't sound
like a quality of life

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:17.597 align:middle line:90%
that most humans would want.

00:15:17.597 --> 00:15:19.263 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, I think
for some of them,

00:15:19.263 --> 00:15:20.780 align:middle line:84%
it gave them great
purpose to create

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.910 align:middle line:90%
this energy within the tunnels.

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Because by doing these circles
and creating this energy,

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.860 align:middle line:84%
they were also
benefiting the Earth.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And so they felt very
connected deep in the tunnels,

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.120 align:middle line:84%
and that was their
sense of purpose.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Instead
of just survival.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, because I mean,
your creativity is somewhat

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:41.570 align:middle line:90%
limited in its expression.

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:43.160 align:middle line:90%
Not a lot of resources.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Also they
can connect deeply

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:46.340 align:middle line:90%
with the Earth in that way.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
makes sense, yeah.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, well we're going
to move on past that.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned
before that when

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.040 align:middle line:84%
the face was originally
built and Jen

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.170 align:middle line:84%
was watching it
being built, you were

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.320 align:middle line:90%
looking at a feline, a cat.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Now why was that,
and then what's

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.080 align:middle line:84%
the story of how the cat
ultimately became the pharaoh?

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And what kind of timeline are we
looking at in terms of the age

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:14.210 align:middle line:84%
as far as can be determined
in a regression of the Sphinx?

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, the Sphinx
was first the jungle-like cat

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:22.070 align:middle line:84%
facade because that was the
apex predator in the area.

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:24.380 align:middle line:84%
There's other
Sphinx-like structures,

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:28.400 align:middle line:84%
and they would also have the
apex predator of that area

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.320 align:middle line:90%
as the facade there.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:35.660 align:middle line:84%
But it was changed
with the symbolically

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:39.350 align:middle line:84%
with a takeover of the
masculine energy and control.

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.170 align:middle line:84%
So symbolically, there
are so many symbols

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:43.800 align:middle line:90%
in our world today.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:48.200 align:middle line:84%
So symbolically, when they
just totally changed the face,

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:53.780 align:middle line:84%
it was to symbolize that
takeover of greed and this--

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dominance and control.

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right, exactly.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, did
she have any sense

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:03.140 align:middle line:84%
of the age of when it was
originally constructed

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.510 align:middle line:90%
in its original feline form?

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: That was
before civilization.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:11.630 align:middle line:84%
That was when they were
starting to colonize Antarctica.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:16.670 align:middle line:84%
So Antarctica, at that period of
time, had green rolling hills,

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:18.770 align:middle line:84%
and it was really
peaceful to live there,

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:20.819 align:middle line:90%
and everybody was very excited.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:24.020 align:middle line:84%
They were so excited about this
project they were creating,

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and they had many
children hybrids,

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:27.710 align:middle line:90%
and they were so happy.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:29.750 align:middle line:84%
My clients just
describe Antarctica

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.348 align:middle line:84%
during that time
as just amazing.

00:17:31.348 --> 00:17:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A kind of Eden.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And then even when Jen would
have difficulties in her life,

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.550 align:middle line:84%
she would be taken
back to a memory

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:44.660 align:middle line:84%
just to see Antarctica because
it gave her such great peace.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.780 align:middle line:84%
So it was during that
time, way before Antarctica

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.248 align:middle line:90%
went under the ice.

00:17:49.248 --> 00:17:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're looking at
hundreds of thousands of years.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, definitely.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the Sphinx
would be much older than even

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Robert Schoch suggested, who
outraged everyone saying it

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.650 align:middle line:90%
was 11, 12,000 years old.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:03.990 align:middle line:90%
Way, way.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you look at other
esoteric systems that say

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.520 align:middle line:90%
the pyramid is at least 85--

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.690 align:middle line:84%
at least 100,000 years old,
those are speculations.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:20.790 align:middle line:84%
They could be even
further back than that.

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And much of the evidence and
many of the Great Pyramids

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.670 align:middle line:84%
are long buried under
the sand, and we have yet

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:27.870 align:middle line:90%
to rediscover them.

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:30.100 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, yeah, and
it's not his fault. I mean,

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.350 align:middle line:90%
it's really hard to know.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, no,
no, he was trying

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.400 align:middle line:84%
to be as conservative
as he could on it,

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.467 align:middle line:84%
and that was outrageous
in the time though.

00:18:37.467 --> 00:18:40.050 align:middle line:84%
It got him in a lot of trouble
to stick his neck out that far.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Wow.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He'd deviate from the
original Egyptians antiquities

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:47.410 align:middle line:84%
department version of the story,
which is a whole other thing.

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:48.840 align:middle line:84%
So this is what's
nice about this

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.540 align:middle line:84%
because it's coming through
intuitive and regressed

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:52.500 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:58.768 align:middle line:84%
It can't tick off any members
of any kind of institutions.

00:18:58.768 --> 00:19:00.560 align:middle line:84%
It's just that they
can make what they want

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.120 align:middle line:90%
of it, which is why I love it.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:08.130 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now looking at the
Sphinx from Jen's point of view,

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.420 align:middle line:84%
there was information planted
there under, I believe,

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.220 align:middle line:90%
the left paw.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Many, many people
have seen this.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.070 align:middle line:84%
That there's something for
us to access under the paw.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.900 align:middle line:90%
What did she see?

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.540 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So she saw
that there were crafts.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.480 align:middle line:84%
There were extraterrestrial
crafts, technology there,

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.440 align:middle line:90%
stored under there.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And just like a treasure trove
of different information.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.600 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about
this information

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.870 align:middle line:84%
under the Sphinx that's still
there that's important to know

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.180 align:middle line:84%
is you can only
see it when you've

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:39.400 align:middle line:84%
reached a certain level
in your existence.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.210 align:middle line:84%
So you can't see it
at the current level

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:46.710 align:middle line:84%
in this, I guess you could
call it plane of existence,

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:49.830 align:middle line:84%
in this 3D reality
with our mindset now.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:52.350 align:middle line:84%
You have to raise
your vibration enough

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:55.520 align:middle line:84%
to receive certain
information within the Sphinx.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
my understanding too,

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:01.680 align:middle line:84%
even from my own guides that
that information will not

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.990 align:middle line:84%
be revealed until we've
reached a certain level

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.810 align:middle line:90%
of understanding.

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what's
interesting about it

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:13.170 align:middle line:84%
is in talking with Marco
Vigato, for example, and others

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:16.140 align:middle line:84%
about the technological
progress of Atlantis

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:20.730 align:middle line:84%
and the destructions
that ultimately occurred

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.340 align:middle line:84%
as a result of heavy
reliance on materialism

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:27.330 align:middle line:84%
over our spiritual, mental
matrix and faculties,

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:29.010 align:middle line:84%
I wonder about that
with the Sphinx.

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:31.260 align:middle line:84%
When you have to be a
certain vibration to see it,

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:36.180 align:middle line:84%
that means it must be going back
into spiritual technologies,

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.390 align:middle line:84%
not just technological
spacecraft and such.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Exactly.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:43.290 align:middle line:84%
You have to be able to use your
mind in order to access it.

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and
that's what she was saying.

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And you have
to be ready for it.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Like even me, for example,
before I was into spirituality,

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.620 align:middle line:84%
someone gave me an Esther Hicks
book, "Ask and It Was Given"--

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.740 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Something,
which is a great book,

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.900 align:middle line:84%
but I took one look at
it and threw it out.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.690 align:middle line:84%
I was so mad that we
create our own reality

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:01.710 align:middle line:90%
because I wasn't ready.

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:03.640 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be ready
for this information.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.648 align:middle line:84%
And Yana is another
one of your clients.

00:21:06.648 --> 00:21:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little
bit about-- we're

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:10.255 align:middle line:84%
going to go into a couple
of Yana's journeys.

00:21:10.255 --> 00:21:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And there was another
woman named Mary,

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.500 align:middle line:90%
I want to talk about hers too.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.010 align:middle line:90%
That was really interesting.

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:17.910 align:middle line:84%
But Yana was saying that
the Sphinx was actually

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:22.110 align:middle line:84%
developed in another
dimension initially before it

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:24.270 align:middle line:90%
became the physical Sphinx.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:25.710 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that a bit?

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: So Yana discovered
that the Sphinx was connected

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:32.970 align:middle line:84%
to her home and back in
this one past life in Egypt,

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.580 align:middle line:84%
she would go to the Sphinx
so that she could connect

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.670 align:middle line:84%
to her home planet and she
could receive information

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:39.750 align:middle line:90%
through the Sphinx.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And she noticed that
you can still do this.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:47.130 align:middle line:84%
You can tune in to the kind of
frequency that the Sphinx emits

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:50.010 align:middle line:84%
and just communicate back
with your own home planet

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:51.900 align:middle line:90%
if you feel a calling to do so.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.055 align:middle line:84%
Almost like tuning
the radio dial.

00:21:54.055 --> 00:21:55.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
interesting for anyone

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.750 align:middle line:84%
watching who's planning
to go on a tour of Egypt.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, definitely.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.885 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And who
has a chance to touch

00:21:59.885 --> 00:22:02.370 align:middle line:84%
the base of the Sphinx,
that would be amazing.

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh my gosh, definitely.

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.360 align:middle line:84%
One of my clients actually
did channel the Sphinx,

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.190 align:middle line:90%
and it was so fascinating.

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:10.092 align:middle line:84%
We were asking it
questions and--

00:22:10.092 --> 00:22:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tell us about that.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Well, it was Fred.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.840 align:middle line:90%
And I asked Fred--

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:21.010 align:middle line:84%
well, Fred said, hey, I can
channel the Sphinx right now.

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:24.030 align:middle line:84%
So of course, as curious as
I am, I said, well, go ahead.

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:25.660 align:middle line:90%
What does it want to say?

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.420 align:middle line:90%
And it said, I am you.

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Because basically it's tapped
into universal consciousness,

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.250 align:middle line:90%
so it is us.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.620 align:middle line:84%
So essentially we
are also the Sphinx

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.870 align:middle line:84%
as well, which I thought
was really interesting.

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the hard drive
human awareness, consciousness,

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:40.740 align:middle line:90%
and history.

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:41.970 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Exactly, exactly.

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:43.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
else did Fred see?

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
Fred for a moment.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.200 align:middle line:10%
>>COSME: Oh my gosh, Fred is
such an interesting character

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:10%
because my client--

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.390 align:middle line:10%
my other two clients kept saying
that this being named Three

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:55.410 align:middle line:10%
will show up.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
Fred's session,

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:02.160 align:middle line:84%
when I asked who I was speaking
with, he said, I am Three.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't even know that I
had been learning about Three.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:10.350 align:middle line:84%
But Fred was very connected
with that being that you

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.570 align:middle line:90%
would call Thoth, "toth."

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:13.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Three, yeah.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Mm-hmm, and Three
was this bringer of light.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:18.990 align:middle line:84%
It was an
extraterrestrial presence

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:22.530 align:middle line:84%
that would come down on Earth to
try to help humanity before it

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:23.880 align:middle line:90%
destroyed one another.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And basically Three was
just sharing information

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:31.230 align:middle line:84%
about how we're all fractal
of universal consciousness

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:34.950 align:middle line:84%
and how we all create
from the spiritual heart.

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.290 align:middle line:84%
So the frequency of
the spiritual heart

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.090 align:middle line:90%
can help you create anything.

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And Three was basically sharing
this information about how just

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:46.350 align:middle line:84%
being kind to another can
really help you dust off

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:48.570 align:middle line:84%
the cobwebs of your
spiritual heart,

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:49.960 align:middle line:90%
and you can create that way.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:53.850 align:middle line:84%
So being kind to one another
can actually help you manifest.

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I loved that
part of the book, honestly.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:24:00.960 align:middle line:84%
He had some really lovely
testimony, so to speak.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.153 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right, definitely.

00:24:02.153 --> 00:24:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Anything
else from Fred?

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:05.737 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to go back
to Yana for a bit and what

00:24:05.737 --> 00:24:07.557 align:middle line:84%
happened when your
session was interrupted.

00:24:07.557 --> 00:24:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh my gosh.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:12.517 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, that has never
happened to me before ever.

00:24:12.517 --> 00:24:13.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So OK, let's go to it.

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:15.535 align:middle line:84%
You're with Yana,
OK, and you guys

00:24:15.535 --> 00:24:17.910 align:middle line:84%
are in the middle of a session
and tell us what happened.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: It was just a
regular session, so I thought.

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was regressing
Yana to that past life,

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and she wanted to go
see her home planet.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So I asked her
higher consciousness

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:32.450 align:middle line:84%
to take her to her
home planet that she

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:33.950 align:middle line:90%
wanted to see so badly.

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
this different voice

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:39.110 align:middle line:84%
came through Yana, and
said we have to interrupt

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:40.580 align:middle line:90%
this session right now.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.695 align:middle line:84%
You're getting too close to
confidential information.

00:24:43.695 --> 00:24:44.495 align:middle line:90%
I thought, why?

00:24:44.495 --> 00:24:46.100 align:middle line:90%
Why is it confidential?

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And they said because it would
be too confusing for humanity

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.040 align:middle line:84%
to understand, and
you're getting too close.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, what would
happen if you just tell me?

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.630 align:middle line:84%
If you just tell me this
confidential information.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.750 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, it would
cause too much confusion.

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:05.600 align:middle line:84%
It's very classified
information.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.990 align:middle line:84%
You're getting too close to the
energy from Yana's home planet

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:12.740 align:middle line:84%
that will be free energy in
the future for this planet.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And there was other information
that they couldn't divulge.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.410 align:middle line:84%
So my session was
interrupted, and then

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:23.660 align:middle line:84%
they said, OK, now
we'll bring Yana back,

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.810 align:middle line:84%
and we'll show her
this other scene

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:29.840 align:middle line:84%
and let you go on with
your session again.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.005 align:middle line:84%
And any time I got too
close, they interrupted us,

00:25:33.005 --> 00:25:34.793 align:middle line:90%
they interrupted the session.

00:25:34.793 --> 00:25:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And again,
when you say "too close,"

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:41.000 align:middle line:84%
it was to a type or a source
of energy that they said we're

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.365 align:middle line:90%
not to know about yet.

00:25:42.365 --> 00:25:43.880 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Not to
know about it yet.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.172 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I assume because
we don't have the wisdom

00:25:46.172 --> 00:25:48.020 align:middle line:90%
to use it for right purpose.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Right, for the
right purpose, exactly.

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:54.410 align:middle line:84%
But I've had other clients
go to this same home planet.

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:56.150 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was the
same because they

00:25:56.150 --> 00:26:00.980 align:middle line:84%
describe it the same way with
these kind of spires on it.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And when they see
this home planet,

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.130 align:middle line:84%
they get overwhelmed and
very emotional because it

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.650 align:middle line:84%
seems for many humans
walking the planet today,

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:10.770 align:middle line:90%
it's in their blood.

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:14.940 align:middle line:84%
It's in their DNA to want to
go back to this home planet.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.960 align:middle line:84%
So even a glimpse of
it affects them deeply,

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.690 align:middle line:90%
and they remember instantly.

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:22.490 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's where I'm from.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:23.450 align:middle line:90%
That's my home.

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:24.360 align:middle line:90%
I want to go back.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.568 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do they remember
any of the characteristics

00:26:26.568 --> 00:26:29.250 align:middle line:84%
of the people or the
civilization or anything?

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:32.780 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: All they know is
that their home had to die,

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:36.050 align:middle line:84%
had to lay fallow for a while
until it could be rebuilt.

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:38.450 align:middle line:84%
That it had finished
its life cycle.

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:42.950 align:middle line:84%
I guess if you could imagine
this Earth and this Earth

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.320 align:middle line:84%
finally finishing
its life cycle,

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.240 align:middle line:84%
the connection you
have to this Earth,

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.340 align:middle line:84%
if you are going to
a different planet

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.890 align:middle line:84%
to stay while this
Earth is being rebuilt,

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:53.900 align:middle line:84%
it would be in
your DNA probably.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.600 align:middle line:84%
You would remember this Earth
and the beauty and everything

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.590 align:middle line:90%
and want to go back.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.763 align:middle line:90%
So that's kind of how I feel--

00:26:59.763 --> 00:27:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.097 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: It happens
for my clients

00:27:02.097 --> 00:27:05.120 align:middle line:84%
or how they feel about
that other home planet.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.780 align:middle line:84%
That once they see it,
they just want to go back.

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now that crosses
over into the subject of Mars

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.780 align:middle line:84%
because Mars started coming
up in this story as well.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:16.580 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Talking about a
planet that had a catastrophe

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:24.030 align:middle line:90%
and lost its inhabitability.

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So can we talk about
that for a moment?

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Sure.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
they were saying

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:29.382 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people that
are curious about Mars

00:27:29.382 --> 00:27:31.860 align:middle line:84%
are curious because that's
where they once were.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Exactly.

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:33.993 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So tell us that story.

00:27:33.993 --> 00:27:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: There's always a
reason why you have a curiosity

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:37.670 align:middle line:90%
to something anyway.

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:40.400 align:middle line:84%
It's your intuition
leading you to something.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.620 align:middle line:84%
So for many, just
hearing this story

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.140 align:middle line:84%
will help them so
much because they

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:48.450 align:middle line:90%
have that curiosity about Mars.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.170 align:middle line:84%
So apparently there were
many beings living on Mars

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:53.960 align:middle line:84%
when there was a collision
in the atmosphere,

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:57.798 align:middle line:84%
and it blanketed Mars,
and it turned cold,

00:27:57.798 --> 00:27:59.340 align:middle line:84%
and they couldn't
live there anymore.

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.780 align:middle line:84%
So they asked for help, and
some beings didn't make it.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:04.970 align:middle line:84%
There were many people
that perished on Mars

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:06.840 align:middle line:84%
and many that were
rescued as well.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.820 align:middle line:84%
But for some, just seeing the
civilization being rebuilt

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.820 align:middle line:84%
would really help them so
much in their life right now.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about the notion
of being underground on Mars?

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: They had
tunnels within Mars

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.510 align:middle line:84%
where they would transport
their food and stuff like that.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:27.650 align:middle line:84%
They were basically
vegetarian in nature.

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:28.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So--

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And they went
underground during--

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
why I was asking.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:34.240 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: During the cataclysm
when they waited for help.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.630 align:middle line:84%
But they couldn't really support
themselves and sustain life

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:40.380 align:middle line:90%
there under the ground there.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, because
there were some people,

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:49.120 align:middle line:84%
like Robert Dean who was a
lovely man in the military

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.760 align:middle line:84%
for many years who
had been shown--

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.490 align:middle line:84%
and many say that they've
seen these maps of Mars,

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and that it's being
inhabited right now

00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:00.610 align:middle line:84%
and that they're actually
colonies of Earth people

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:03.440 align:middle line:84%
that are living there
right now but underground.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.690 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, I heard that too.

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:05.560 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did any of that
come up in any regressions?

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Just that, that there
are humans living there now.

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:15.375 align:middle line:84%
That's what I heard with
my clients under hypnosis.

00:29:15.375 --> 00:29:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
you're saying--

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And that
there's life on Mars.

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:19.533 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
what you're saying

00:29:19.533 --> 00:29:23.350 align:middle line:84%
is making me think that the
people that might be living

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:25.990 align:middle line:84%
on Mars, as far as
some accounts say,

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:29.020 align:middle line:84%
might very well be those
who lived there once before

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:30.437 align:middle line:84%
and their planet
was lost to them.

00:29:30.437 --> 00:29:31.437 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, definitely.

00:29:31.437 --> 00:29:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
they're back and just

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:36.510 align:middle line:84%
trying to re-establish in a
place they're more comfortable.

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:37.310 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:38.727 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So did
they say anything

00:29:38.727 --> 00:29:40.420 align:middle line:84%
about the future
of Mars in terms

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:43.570 align:middle line:84%
of the habitability
and the ability

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:45.850 align:middle line:84%
to survive there more
easily in the future?

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Yes, they said
it will be rebuilt,

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:52.440 align:middle line:84%
and people will live
there in the near future.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What about Venus?

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Does anything ever come
through from Venus?

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: No, but I'll ask.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's
interesting because I

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:02.860 align:middle line:84%
didn't read that in any of
these, and I was thinking,

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:04.540 align:middle line:84%
I bet Venus will
start popping through.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:04.900 align:middle line:90%
Anyway--

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: You never know.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe it's
planting a seed.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:10.120 align:middle line:90%
So another thing that came up--

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:13.150 align:middle line:90%
and this is a big one for me--

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:14.770 align:middle line:90%
and this message came through--

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.830 align:middle line:84%
I think Jen, it
came through Fred,

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and it may have
come through Yana.

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:22.600 align:middle line:84%
You remind me, and
that was when people

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.070 align:middle line:90%
were looking at Earth's future.

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.170 align:middle line:84%
When they were looking
at Earth's future,

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:29.980 align:middle line:84%
they would go into these
progressions as well,

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and it's not what
we're being told.

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh my gosh, not at all.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, so
I would like you

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:37.150 align:middle line:84%
to tell that story of
what they're seeing

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:38.350 align:middle line:90%
about the future of Earth.

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:40.840 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well first of
all, none of these people

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.480 align:middle line:84%
know one another,
and they don't know

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.380 align:middle line:90%
what the other person said.

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.470 align:middle line:84%
So I do that just
to keep this valid.

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And they all say the
same things, all of them,

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:52.750 align:middle line:90%
including--

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:55.510 align:middle line:84%
I do this job almost
every day, that Earth is

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:58.090 align:middle line:90%
moving into an amazing place.

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:01.120 align:middle line:84%
That this will be a
kinder, gentler Earth.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.670 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be an
amazing place to live,

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:05.960 align:middle line:84%
that everything
is right on track.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.390 align:middle line:90%
The Earth is ascending.

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Basically what they
say is the Earth

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.660 align:middle line:90%
is on a trajectory of planets.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.450 align:middle line:84%
There are many
other Earth planets,

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:16.573 align:middle line:84%
and they move up like the
rungs of like a ladder--

00:31:16.573 --> 00:31:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But dimensionally.

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:18.540 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And so once the Earth
hits a certain frequency,

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.380 align:middle line:90%
it will become a light planet.

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Right now, Earth is
classified right now

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.310 align:middle line:90%
as a manifestation planet.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:28.610 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't before.

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:30.940 align:middle line:84%
So you can manifest
a lot easier now,

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:33.200 align:middle line:84%
but everything is
right on track.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.250 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials that
speak through my clients

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:39.160 align:middle line:84%
are very happy with the
progress and happy with the way

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.270 align:middle line:90%
everything's going.

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:45.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yes, there's chaos,
but the future looks amazing.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when they each
spoke of it, the question was,

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:51.550 align:middle line:84%
well, is there a time when
Earth will become extinct?

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:53.675 align:middle line:84%
And you must have been the
one asking the question.

00:31:53.675 --> 00:31:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: I'm curious.

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:56.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Of these
people out of curiosity.

00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And every time, they said no,
not for millions of years.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:03.430 align:middle line:84%
When it goes through
its own natural cycle,

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:05.360 align:middle line:84%
that's millions
of years from now.

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.720 align:middle line:84%
That is not for us
to be even thinking

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.152 align:middle line:90%
about, nor concerned with.

00:32:09.152 --> 00:32:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: We're nowhere close.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the notion of
people and mass extinction

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:16.805 align:middle line:84%
of humanity and life forms, tell
us what they said about that.

00:32:16.805 --> 00:32:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Yeah, I was
curious about that

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:22.780 align:middle line:84%
too because it seemed like we
were repeating the Atlantis

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:23.710 align:middle line:90%
cycle.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And no, we're actually doing
things so much better, so

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:31.150 align:middle line:84%
much differently, and there's
so much help on the planet.

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:34.810 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
extraterrestrial volunteers

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:37.960 align:middle line:84%
embodied in a human
body right now helping.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:40.050 align:middle line:84%
There's extraterrestrials
helping from--

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
interdimensional beings.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.883 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: They're all over.

00:32:42.883 --> 00:32:45.092 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're saying
extraterrestrials is anything

00:32:45.092 --> 00:32:46.695 align:middle line:84%
that's not human,
but it's actually--

00:32:46.695 --> 00:32:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: It's everybody.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You refer to
every kind of entity.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interdimensional,
angelic, et cetera.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.190 align:middle line:90%
They're all here helping us.

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:56.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of curious,
when you look

00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:59.560 align:middle line:84%
at the Atlantean times in the
stories that are emerging,

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:03.310 align:middle line:84%
the competition and
overreliance upon technology

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:05.960 align:middle line:84%
seem to be a bit of a
downfall for humanity.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now we're reaching
those same decision points.

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:13.390 align:middle line:84%
It must be that
these beings feel

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:16.180 align:middle line:84%
we are making decisions
that will ultimately

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:19.610 align:middle line:90%
avert that same trajectory.

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:23.515 align:middle line:84%
So something's helping wise
us up a little bit over what

00:33:23.515 --> 00:33:24.315 align:middle line:90%
we've been before.

00:33:24.315 --> 00:33:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, definitely.

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's this special
light hitting the planet

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:30.490 align:middle line:84%
right now that
many of my clients

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:31.540 align:middle line:90%
have been talking about.

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:35.140 align:middle line:84%
It's like this bluish
white light that's

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.060 align:middle line:90%
just blanketing the Earth.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:38.500 align:middle line:90%
It's been blanketing the Earth.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.610 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it.

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:43.330 align:middle line:84%
It's raising the frequency of
the inhabitants and the Earth

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:47.410 align:middle line:84%
as well, and it's a very
healing light all over.

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:49.210 align:middle line:84%
Just trying to
remove things that

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:54.260 align:middle line:84%
are unwanted from people
and the Earth as well.

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At the same time,
when you remove things,

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.610 align:middle line:84%
we have a tendency
to cling a bit,

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:00.590 align:middle line:84%
and we don't like
change too much.

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So the chaos comes in
our reaction to the fact

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:07.760 align:middle line:84%
that our own higher
essence, our own higher self

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.500 align:middle line:84%
is trying to remove
these things from us,

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.949 align:middle line:84%
and that's being
drenched in that light.

00:34:12.949 --> 00:34:15.380 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right, right.

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:16.739 align:middle line:90%
It's a very exciting time.

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:20.060 align:middle line:84%
But as far as the technology,
this is really exciting

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.489 align:middle line:84%
because during
Atlantis, we moved

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:27.350 align:middle line:84%
too far in our technology,
and we didn't have compassion.

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:29.389 align:middle line:84%
See, what's different
about these times

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:31.460 align:middle line:84%
is that we're holding
compassion now,

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.530 align:middle line:84%
and we're moving
with the technology.

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:34.767 align:middle line:90%
We're creating balance.

00:34:34.767 --> 00:34:36.350 align:middle line:84%
It's all about the
balance, and that's

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:39.889 align:middle line:84%
what we were striving to do
before, but we didn't do it.

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:41.420 align:middle line:90%
This time we're doing it right.

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:44.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It does seem
like the it factor

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:49.400 align:middle line:84%
now that may have become
dampened back then

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.660 align:middle line:90%
is the energy of the heart.

00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you talk about
that a little bit like--

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:57.139 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Like what
Three was talking about,

00:34:57.139 --> 00:35:01.520 align:middle line:84%
just the frequency, the
spiritual heart and being

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.080 align:middle line:90%
compassion, holding--

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.230 align:middle line:84%
being compassionate and holding
compassion for one another.

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:07.130 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:08.660 align:middle line:90%
It helps you so much.

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And especially doing the
job I do when I take people

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:14.330 align:middle line:84%
to the afterlife and they
do their life review,

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:15.950 align:middle line:84%
they realize that
every single thing

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:19.010 align:middle line:84%
they did to help somebody
else comes back to them.

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:22.230 align:middle line:84%
They feel it greatly
every single thing.

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:25.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's an incredible thing
to be kind to another person.

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:28.040 align:middle line:84%
It helps you just
as it helps them.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's
also a frequency.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: It is.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
frequency ultimately

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:34.970 align:middle line:90%
is what creates change.

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:36.770 align:middle line:84%
The Earth's ascension,
our ascension

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:40.790 align:middle line:84%
into reconnecting with the
spiritual aspect of life

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:42.740 align:middle line:90%
itself, cosmos, et cetera.

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.270 align:middle line:90%
To me, that's ascension.

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:46.605 align:middle line:90%
It's reconnecting with spirit.

00:35:46.605 --> 00:35:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: I love that.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.022 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, in
the simplest form,

00:35:49.022 --> 00:35:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and we're all in the
process one way or another.

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Did they talk at all
in any of these about

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.590 align:middle line:84%
artificial intelligence in that
being developed on the planet

00:35:58.590 --> 00:35:59.390 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Yes, there's
been a lot of talk

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.770 align:middle line:90%
through my clients about that.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about it.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, they were
saying that it's only

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:08.000 align:middle line:90%
beneficial in the right hands.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.230 align:middle line:90%
It's divine.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:10.940 align:middle line:90%
It's divine planning.

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:12.530 align:middle line:84%
That's the way we're
supposed to move.

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:17.150 align:middle line:84%
This is our future, but as
long as the right people

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:18.560 align:middle line:90%
hold the key.

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.020 align:middle line:84%
But there's so much
help right now.

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.510 align:middle line:84%
There's so much help to
make sure things go well,

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:28.132 align:middle line:84%
so I'm not worried as far
as the trajectory right now.

00:36:28.132 --> 00:36:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, well,
I mean, they're all

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:32.090 align:middle line:84%
seeing the same outcome,
so I'm not either.

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:35.030 align:middle line:84%
But I find this point where
we're making decisions

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.740 align:middle line:90%
absolutely fascinating.

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Not only the chaos because
of our human nature

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:43.040 align:middle line:84%
of clinging to the familiar
when it's time to let go.

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.090 align:middle line:84%
That causes chaos
and discomfort.

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:45.890 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:48.903 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But also the
imagination of what's

00:36:48.903 --> 00:36:50.570 align:middle line:84%
happening in the world
of entertainment.

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:52.520 align:middle line:84%
I pay close attention
to entertainment

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:56.090 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of it's predictive
programming, and some of it

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:58.130 align:middle line:90%
is also showing potential.

00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:00.440 align:middle line:90%
And there is this series--

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.960 align:middle line:90%
I think it's on Amazon Prime--

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.970 align:middle line:90%
called "Humans."

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And what it's about is we've
reached a point where AI

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:10.820 align:middle line:84%
and robotics that are
synthetic humans--

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:12.530 align:middle line:90%
they're called synths--

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:15.320 align:middle line:84%
robotic humans now
live alongside humanity

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.690 align:middle line:84%
to help us with the
more mundane tasks

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:20.960 align:middle line:84%
so that life actually becomes
easier so we have more time

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:24.800 align:middle line:84%
to do what we wish contemplate,
have a more ease on planet

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.410 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:29.500 align:middle line:84%
But then the notion of
human consciousness merging

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:33.010 align:middle line:84%
with synthetic consciousness
enters the story,

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:41.170 align:middle line:84%
and that's where all of these
incredible philosophical types

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:43.480 align:middle line:90%
of questions start rising.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And very direct emotional
kinds of responses people

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:51.040 align:middle line:90%
have to this.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:56.370 align:middle line:84%
This perfected being that
has now human consciousness

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:58.025 align:middle line:90%
that's self-organizing.

00:37:58.025 --> 00:38:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And so you look at it and
think, where are we going

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:02.130 align:middle line:90%
to end up on this trajectory?

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And they ask the question,
is that the human trajectory?

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Is remaining carbon-based
but awake and aware

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:14.220 align:middle line:84%
and truly sentient, is that our
trajectory with the aid of AI,

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.700 align:middle line:84%
which is what you're
talking about.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.992 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, you look at
other planets, the ones that

00:38:17.992 --> 00:38:21.540 align:middle line:84%
have evolved themselves,
like the Arcturians say,

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.040 align:middle line:90%
they have technology.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.420 align:middle line:84%
They have any kind
of technology.

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: And they're
very compassionate,

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:29.280 align:middle line:84%
so they just chose
to keep balance.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
what's being exemplified

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:36.280 align:middle line:90%
in this series, British series.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.660 align:middle line:84%
It seems that the ones with the
highest levels of compassion

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:43.440 align:middle line:84%
often end up being AI, but
they may also be human.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:48.540 align:middle line:84%
So you're looking at the
declined intelligence,

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:51.150 align:middle line:84%
emotional intelligence
on both sides

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:54.390 align:middle line:84%
and the elevated emotional
intelligence on both sides,

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:59.760 align:middle line:84%
but compassion is a huge
keyword in that series.

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's, I think, the heart
and compassion is going to--

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:06.900 align:middle line:84%
I agree with you--
be the key to the way

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:10.262 align:middle line:84%
we choose to interface
with AI in the future.

00:39:10.262 --> 00:39:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: It is the key.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just
being put on us

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.790 align:middle line:84%
in ways we don't
appreciate at the moment.

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:15.590 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and we have
to call the shots on that.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:18.680 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the
kinder, gentler world,

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:21.930 align:middle line:90%
same thing my guide's told me.

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:23.340 align:middle line:90%
Looks just like Earth.

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:25.020 align:middle line:84%
It's like the
Earth you have now.

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful, but you are
living amongst more

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:31.110 align:middle line:84%
like-minded people, more
collaborative people.

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:35.790 align:middle line:84%
It's a more beautiful way of
living on and with the Earth.

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Right, you'll be able
to communicate with the Earth.

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:39.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:42.110 align:middle line:90%
And so now let's go to Mary.

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:43.520 align:middle line:90%
Red crystals pop up.

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:46.590 align:middle line:84%
They popped up in Jen's story
of Atlantis and so forth.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:50.870 align:middle line:84%
But Mary in the fairy realm,
because I think that realm

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:54.860 align:middle line:84%
is really prominent right
now on a lot of levels.

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:58.220 align:middle line:84%
They're really making themselves
more known to earthlings.

00:39:58.220 --> 00:39:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Right, it
was so fascinating

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:02.660 align:middle line:84%
how these fairies were
using these mirrors.

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And she kept saying,
humans think they are wands

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:08.120 align:middle line:84%
but they're mirrors,
and we use them

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.100 align:middle line:84%
to access different dimensions
by shining this mirror

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.530 align:middle line:90%
or reflecting the light.

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:14.567 align:middle line:90%
It would open the dimension.

00:40:14.567 --> 00:40:16.400 align:middle line:84%
That they would take
the different crystals,

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.160 align:middle line:84%
and they would place some
different places to help people

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:22.070 align:middle line:84%
with time travel and just
whatever they needed.

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Because these crystals
are so sought after.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Humans can't have any of
these crystals at the moment.

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're keeping them
away from-- hidden from humans.

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: They are.

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:33.055 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, until we
reached the level.

00:40:33.055 --> 00:40:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not a
chance until we--

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:35.420 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Exactly.

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:36.878 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us
a little bit more

00:40:36.878 --> 00:40:38.990 align:middle line:84%
about the nature of the
elemental kingdom that she

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:42.260 align:middle line:84%
was-- she went back into a time
where she was part of that.

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:45.102 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Right, and she could
remember all her past lives.

00:40:45.102 --> 00:40:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Did tell us about--

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:48.200 align:middle line:84%
everyone's fascinated
with elementals.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit more
about Mary and her experiences.

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:51.740 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: It was so cute.

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:54.330 align:middle line:84%
She said it was like a
dollhouse where she lived,

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:56.570 align:middle line:84%
and she was just
laughing so much.

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And she had access to
all of her past lives.

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:03.950 align:middle line:84%
There was no forgetting
in that realm.

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And they were just beautiful
little light beings

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:08.775 align:middle line:90%
that just wanted to help and--

00:41:08.775 --> 00:41:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did
they work with Earth,

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.760 align:middle line:90%
with Mother Nature with humans?

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:14.870 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:15.680 align:middle line:90%
In what ways?

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.763 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: That's their job.

00:41:16.763 --> 00:41:21.530 align:middle line:84%
That's their role to work
with humans and Mother Nature

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:24.680 align:middle line:84%
and to basically just to
work with both of them

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:26.870 align:middle line:84%
and to help them in
whatever way they can.

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Just beautiful little light
beings that seem so happy.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Because she said there's
so much laughter here.

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Just constantly
laughing and playing.

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think we
all want to go there.

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Next life.

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm going to
be a fairy next lifetime.

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right, right.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Not an
evil dwarf, right?

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Yeah.

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you talked about
the blue light a moment ago,

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.520 align:middle line:84%
it's something that's
happening right now.

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.180 align:middle line:84%
But some of the people this
information came through, said,

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.560 align:middle line:90%
it's not just right now.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.630 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
continuing for a while.

00:41:56.630 --> 00:42:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Right, and it's OK if
you're not ready for it yet.

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.060 align:middle line:90%
There's so many opportunities.

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.730 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is
accept it basically.

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:06.410 align:middle line:84%
You can just put your
feet on the Earth

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:09.410 align:middle line:84%
and have it be absorbed
through your body.

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:11.690 align:middle line:84%
There's so many ways
to use this light

00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:13.370 align:middle line:90%
or to bathe yourself in it.

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:14.378 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't take much.

00:42:14.378 --> 00:42:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
else did they have

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:20.810 align:middle line:84%
to say about what we can
all do right now to progress

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:23.960 align:middle line:84%
without the same level
of pain, insanity,

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.970 align:middle line:84%
and so forth we've
been going through?

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Because I know
different information

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.480 align:middle line:84%
is coming through
different people.

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.707 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
tools we have here?

00:42:31.707 --> 00:42:32.540 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh my gosh.

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, just to go inwards,
just to quiet your mind.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And I would always ask, what
about for the people that

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.610 align:middle line:90%
don't know how to meditate?

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh, well,
just going out into nature

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:45.080 align:middle line:90%
is good enough.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.360 align:middle line:90%
Being around like-minded people.

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Speaking freely
with another person

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:53.090 align:middle line:84%
that you feel you can just
speak freely with is so healing.

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And besides nature and swimming,
just all different things.

00:42:58.280 --> 00:42:59.780 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
different things you

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.840 align:middle line:84%
can do to raise your
vibration or to connect

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.910 align:middle line:84%
with another person,
connect with the Earth,

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:06.800 align:middle line:84%
or connect with
yourself basically.

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.158 align:middle line:90%
Just listen deeply--

00:43:08.158 --> 00:43:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about connecting
with all the beings besides--

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and especially our higher
self, but everything

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:15.740 align:middle line:84%
in this other realm
that is trying

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:17.892 align:middle line:90%
to help us along the way?

00:43:17.892 --> 00:43:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: That's
really interesting.

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:20.990 align:middle line:84%
So they don't give
me the future,

00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:25.160 align:middle line:84%
but they said the most
predominant future potential

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.630 align:middle line:84%
is that how you
know how everybody

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:28.760 align:middle line:84%
talks about connecting
with the other side.

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.640 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be very
commonplace to connect

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:35.300 align:middle line:84%
with the higher
version of yourself.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.820 align:middle line:84%
If you want to call it an
extraterrestrial version.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:39.050 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has that version--

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA:
Multi-dimensional version.

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:41.510 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Exactly.

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to be
commonplace to connect

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:45.650 align:middle line:90%
with that part of ourselves.

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And everybody will
understand how to do this.

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:49.850 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be easy.

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And just to
add to that, in the most

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:56.570 align:middle line:84%
ancient of Atlantean times, it
was very easy for those realms

00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:58.790 align:middle line:84%
to communicate
between themselves

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:01.580 align:middle line:84%
when they were in not as
dense a physical reality

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and not reliant yet upon
technology but more spiritual

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:05.780 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe it's just
us remembering our way

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:11.840 align:middle line:84%
back to when we used to be able
to communicate that way too.

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:12.920 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, I love that.

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:13.782 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:44:13.782 --> 00:44:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Any final thoughts?

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:17.090 align:middle line:84%
We just have a minute
or so left about tying

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:19.760 align:middle line:84%
this huge subject of the
Sphinx and everything else

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:20.900 align:middle line:90%
we talked about together.

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:22.567 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Well, I would
just love to say,

00:44:22.567 --> 00:44:25.040 align:middle line:84%
because I do this job
almost every single day,

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.140 align:middle line:84%
that the beings that
come through my clients--

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:29.630 align:middle line:84%
you could call them the
extraterrestrials or higher

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:32.270 align:middle line:84%
consciousness-- they
always say that it's

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:34.610 align:middle line:84%
so funny that humans
are always trying

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:36.470 align:middle line:90%
to be when they already are.

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:middle line:84%
They're always trying
to get something

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.800 align:middle line:90%
when they already have it.

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:43.835 align:middle line:84%
That basically a human's job
is to be messy, not perfect.

00:44:43.835 --> 00:44:45.210 align:middle line:84%
We're not supposed
to be perfect.

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:48.050 align:middle line:84%
We're here to be messy,
and we come to this Earth

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:49.820 align:middle line:90%
to have these experiences.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Because when you go back to
in between, then all is known.

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:55.220 align:middle line:90%
You've just forgotten.

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:58.110 align:middle line:84%
That's why there's
chaos and pain.

00:44:58.110 --> 00:44:59.960 align:middle line:84%
But when you go
back to in between,

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:02.070 align:middle line:84%
everything is
known to you again.

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:04.670 align:middle line:84%
So while you're here,
just make a mess.

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:05.750 align:middle line:90%
Don't be perfect.

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Leave the stupid jerk and
have as much fun as possible.

00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:13.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Sarah, that couldn't
be more beautifully said.

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:15.020 align:middle line:90%
Let's just get messy.

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Not beat ourselves
up for being messy

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.417 align:middle line:84%
might even be a
better way to put it.

00:45:18.417 --> 00:45:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And enjoy this and
learn everything we

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.470 align:middle line:90%
can while we have it this way.

00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:22.345 align:middle line:90%
Thank you once again.

00:45:22.345 --> 00:45:23.845 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to see
what you come up

00:45:23.845 --> 00:45:25.910 align:middle line:84%
with next, because
undoubtedly new information is

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:29.220 align:middle line:84%
going to start streaming
through your clients.

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: It already has.

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:31.340 align:middle line:90%
Super exciting.

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:33.855 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to
tease us a little?

00:45:33.855 --> 00:45:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>>COSME: Oh my gosh,
well a lot of what

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:38.450 align:middle line:84%
I've been getting recently
is tribal information

00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and it's been coming
through like crazy.

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:43.340 align:middle line:84%
All these different subjects
that don't know one another.

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Because they said, the
time is right for justice.

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:49.160 align:middle line:10%
Not justice in the
way that something bad

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.890 align:middle line:10%
will happen to somebody
else, but justice in the fact

00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:53.750 align:middle line:10%
that people will
finally be heard.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's mirrored also
by Sheila Gillette and the THEO

00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:58.100 align:middle line:90%
group.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Oh, interesting.

00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes,
people will be heard.

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:03.350 align:middle line:84%
That we're moving to a time
where, believe it or not,

00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:06.960 align:middle line:84%
governments will be serving
the people, not the other way

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:07.760 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>>COSME: Right, right.

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.500 align:middle line:84%
That's what I've
been hearing too.
