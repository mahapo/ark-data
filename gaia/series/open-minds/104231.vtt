Manchurian Candidate,
even Eternal Sunshine

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.630 align:middle line:10%
of the Spotless Mind.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:10%
All of these Hollywood
films depict a future as one

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.110 align:middle line:10%
in which our minds can be
altered without our permission.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.070 align:middle line:84%
But what if the future
also holds the possibility

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.770 align:middle line:84%
to alter our own consciousness,
collectively and personally,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.480 align:middle line:90%
with technology as well?

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Adam Curry is one of the bright
young ones out there today

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.200 align:middle line:84%
who is bringing forth really
astounding information

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.132 align:middle line:90%
in technology.

00:00:55.132 --> 00:00:56.840 align:middle line:84%
He's here with us to
tell us a little bit

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.600 align:middle line:90%
about what our future may hold.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.410 align:middle line:84%
So Adam, it's great
to have you here.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.785 align:middle line:84%
It's so nice to
have a little bit

00:01:01.785 --> 00:01:03.210 align:middle line:84%
younger face than
I usually have,

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.500 align:middle line:84%
and that's just because
you're a genius.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.720 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what can you say?

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.287 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who knows,
maybe had conscious media

00:01:09.287 --> 00:01:11.370 align:middle line:84%
been around in the time
of some of my other guests

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.369 align:middle line:84%
I would have been
interviewing them at your age.

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:14.490 align:middle line:90%
But it's a pleasure.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>>ADAM CURRY: It's a
pleasure for me, too.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.580 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.512 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I wanted to find
out, first of all-- there's

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:20.720 align:middle line:90%
another Adam Curry out there.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.247 align:middle line:84%
Just clear this
up so people don't

00:01:22.247 --> 00:01:24.330 align:middle line:84%
go online and say, Adam
Curry, and they're already

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.975 align:middle line:90%
doing a search.

00:01:24.975 --> 00:01:25.600 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Right.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.800 align:middle line:10%
It's before my time, but I
think in the '80s the first MTV

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.980 align:middle line:10%
VJ was a guy named Adam Curry.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And so the more famous
Adam Curry, of course,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.592 align:middle line:90%
is the MTV VJ.

00:01:37.592 --> 00:01:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
talk about you now,

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.100 align:middle line:90%
the Adam curry that's here.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.510 align:middle line:90%
You were born in Boulder, right?

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.645 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Born in Colorado.

00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:45.811 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, in Colorado.

00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And at a very early
age you started

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.250 align:middle line:84%
having some epiphanies
having to do with gravity,

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:84%
which probably started setting
you apart from your playmates,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.180 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.900 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Unless you were all doing
Dungeons and Dragons together.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.180 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about your
epiphany regarding gravity,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.949 align:middle line:84%
just to kind of let
people start knowing

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:06.240 align:middle line:90%
a little bit about who you are.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to make you talk
about your accomplishments,

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.600 align:middle line:84%
if you don't mind, in
some depth because we

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.036 align:middle line:84%
want to see what kind of
mind we're looking at here.

00:02:14.036 --> 00:02:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: I'll oblige.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.470 align:middle line:10%
>>CURRY: So I grew up tinkering.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.136 align:middle line:10%
I was always taking things apart
and putting them back together,

00:02:20.136 --> 00:02:22.240 align:middle line:10%
and I loved building things.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of mine,
an older friend kind of

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.060 align:middle line:90%
got interested in science.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And he showed me a
badly-xeroxed research report

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.050 align:middle line:84%
by a scientist named
Gregory Hodowanec who worked

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.940 align:middle line:90%
for RCA back in the '70s.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And he found that small
electronic circuits

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.274 align:middle line:84%
called capacitors behave in
strange ways that can't really

00:02:43.274 --> 00:02:43.815 align:middle line:90%
be explained.

00:02:43.815 --> 00:02:45.398 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, hm,
that's interesting.

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:47.210 align:middle line:84%
I was building
electronics at that time,

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.390 align:middle line:84%
so I thought I'd take them
out and start testing it.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.860 align:middle line:84%
I got the idea that whatever's
happening in this capacitor

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.050 align:middle line:84%
might be related to what's
happening on the planet.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.700 align:middle line:84%
You have these giant mass shifts
happening under the earth,

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.116 align:middle line:84%
and maybe there's
some connection.

00:02:59.116 --> 00:03:03.500 align:middle line:84%
So I built a device that
converted these capacitors

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.150 align:middle line:84%
into signals and compared
it to seismic data, so

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.820 align:middle line:90%
earthquake data.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was very lucky, in the
sense that it correlated.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And what that
meant was that this

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.080 align:middle line:84%
is a potentially basic
new technology that

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.740 align:middle line:84%
could help scientists
forecast earthquakes.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.830 align:middle line:90%
So it did really well.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.350 align:middle line:84%
It won lots of awards, and I
got to travel around and talk

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.850 align:middle line:90%
about--

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Were you
17 at this time?

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Yes.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Yeah.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.442 align:middle line:84%
And lobby for building a global
network of these devices.

00:03:34.442 --> 00:03:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
communicate with each other?

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.240 align:middle line:84%
The devices communicate
with one another,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.222 align:middle line:90%
or did they operate singularly?

00:03:40.222 --> 00:03:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: They
operated singularity.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I unfortunately was not able
to build a global network,

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.500 align:middle line:84%
but I did kind of
punt it to some people

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.460 align:middle line:84%
at the USGS who-- I haven't been
in touch with them for awhile,

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.150 align:middle line:84%
but they were looking
into it as well.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
it's interesting

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.570 align:middle line:84%
because off camera I
said, you know, when

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.210 align:middle line:84%
I look at your life-- your
life, your early life reminds me

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.480 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of ways of
Patrick Flanagan,

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.550 align:middle line:84%
who I just-- I
just adore Patrick.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
he became known

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.180 align:middle line:84%
for at 14 years old-- and
this was a long time ago,

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.100 align:middle line:84%
at the science fair
in high school--

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.029 align:middle line:84%
was that he had built a nuclear
detonation detection device.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.846 align:middle line:90%
And he built it for about $15.

00:04:18.846 --> 00:04:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile
there was a project

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.639 align:middle line:84%
going on in Alaska-- I don't
even remember-- 20 million.

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:23.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.130 align:middle line:84%
They spent a lot of money
trying to do the same thing.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.960 align:middle line:84%
So the men in the coats just
came and stole his technology

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.940 align:middle line:90%
and there you go.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.335 align:middle line:90%
That's how his life went.

00:04:32.335 --> 00:04:34.470 align:middle line:84%
But the two of you have
kind of a similar mind

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and a type of-- if
I may say-- there is

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.930 align:middle line:84%
seems kind of an
intellectual purity,

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:84%
but there's also heart involved
in a lot of what you do.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.225 align:middle line:84%
It's not just
intellectual curiosity,

00:04:45.225 --> 00:04:49.080 align:middle line:84%
but you bring an
integrated being behind it.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: Well kids have
the enviable position

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.590 align:middle line:84%
of being able to do
science to the extent

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.180 align:middle line:84%
that they care about it,
and that excites them.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.366 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe that's why you
have young people exploring

00:05:01.366 --> 00:05:02.990 align:middle line:84%
these things that
other people are not.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.531 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're
interested in, but they

00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:06.862 align:middle line:84%
can't do because they
have to put career first.

00:05:06.862 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, they do.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:08.680 align:middle line:90%
And then it gets corrupted.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Then you have to
worry about tenure.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.956 align:middle line:84%
Then you have to worry
about feeding your kids

00:05:11.956 --> 00:05:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and losing that job
at the University.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.690 align:middle line:90%
It all starts coming in.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: Well, maybe with
some of these discoveries

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.670 align:middle line:84%
that will change, and we'll
have a new sort of gold rush

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.310 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to the more
exotic things to research.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.520 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.077 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk
about the year 2002.

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:29.160 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like that was a
really big year for you.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Again, you were in the
spotlight, similar to Patrick,

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.600 align:middle line:90%
with all these accolades.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Talk about what happened,
some of the accolades

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.940 align:middle line:84%
that were awarded to you,
because they were substantial.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: Well, related to the
earthquake device-- let's see,

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.440 align:middle line:84%
MIT gave me the Ceres
Connection prize,

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.910 align:middle line:84%
which is where they name an
asteroid in our solar system

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:54.410 align:middle line:90%
after you.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:55.576 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I read that.

00:05:55.576 --> 00:05:57.712 align:middle line:84%
At 17 you have an
asteroid named after you.

00:05:57.712 --> 00:05:59.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: Yeah, unfortunately
you don't get any, like,

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.904 align:middle line:84%
satisfying statuette
or anything,

00:06:01.904 --> 00:06:03.320 align:middle line:84%
you just kind of
know that there's

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.420 align:middle line:84%
an asteroid floating
around up there in space,

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.550 align:middle line:90%
which is kind of cool.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.883 align:middle line:84%
And then there were some other
scientific accommodations

00:06:08.883 --> 00:06:10.570 align:middle line:90%
from the US Navy and so forth.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.010 align:middle line:84%
But more significantly
perhaps, at that time

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.530 align:middle line:84%
I give a talk at a conference at
the University of Virginia that

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:24.120 align:middle line:84%
was concerning scientific
study of anomalies in general.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And I had gone there
because the capacitor

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.790 align:middle line:84%
stuff that I was looking
at was an anomaly itself.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And having looked at
anomalies, at things

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.080 align:middle line:84%
that can't be explained,
I was able to find

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:41.060 align:middle line:84%
something that really benefited
the science of seismicity.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.560 align:middle line:84%
so when you look at things that
can't be explained sometimes

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.442 align:middle line:84%
you can find new
areas where there's

00:06:46.442 --> 00:06:47.650 align:middle line:90%
a lot of potential to be had.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.300 align:middle line:84%
So I went to this
conference, and it

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.800 align:middle line:84%
was a three-day
conference and there

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.640 align:middle line:84%
were many other
scientists there,

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.410 align:middle line:84%
professional scientists,
research scientists

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.910 align:middle line:84%
and professors as
well who, in each

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.250 align:middle line:84%
of their different disciplines,
had encountered anomalies,

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.830 align:middle line:84%
things that were not explained
by the prevailing theories

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.860 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes dogma,
but that nonetheless

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.940 align:middle line:84%
could revolutionize what
is known in their field.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they were the
ones who had discovered it,

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.290 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes the anomalies
had been sort of "known"

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:19.740 align:middle line:84%
and either overlooked or
intentionally ignored.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.560 align:middle line:84%
But I think to the
detriment of those fields--

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.680 align:middle line:84%
and I was blown away
because I realized

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.560 align:middle line:84%
that this is a systematic
problem in science.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, science it does a
very good job when it concerns

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.830 align:middle line:84%
itself with things
that are OK to study,

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.550 align:middle line:84%
but there are some
things that don't

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.440 align:middle line:84%
fit within our body of
knowledge, and they're ignored.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.790 align:middle line:84%
But that's where
you can find, like,

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.400 align:middle line:90%
the really big discoveries.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.130 align:middle line:84%
That's where you need to look
if you want to take things

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:46.880 align:middle line:90%
to the next level.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.754 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:07:47.754 --> 00:07:50.060 align:middle line:84%
So you were seeing,
as a collective,

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.950 align:middle line:84%
it was not just dogging
what you were doing,

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.170 align:middle line:90%
it was dogging everyone.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:53.753 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Yeah.

00:07:53.753 --> 00:07:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
oftentimes at that level

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.880 align:middle line:84%
it's chosen to be
swept under the rug

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.130 align:middle line:84%
because now you have to stretch
beyond scientific materialism.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:03.885 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: Well, that's
a big-- there's

00:08:03.885 --> 00:08:04.885 align:middle line:90%
a lot to say about that.

00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:05.593 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Say it.

00:08:05.593 --> 00:08:06.300 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: OK.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We can always have
you back if we don't get

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:09.790 align:middle line:90%
through everything on my list.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.295 align:middle line:84%
I want to hear what
you have to say.

00:08:11.295 --> 00:08:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Right.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.265 align:middle line:90%
Well, you mentioned materialism.

00:08:13.265 --> 00:08:16.990 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Scientists don't like
to think that they

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.890 align:middle line:84%
have metaphysical
assumptions, but they do.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And the metaphysical assumption
that scientists, in general,

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.330 align:middle line:84%
these days have is what
we call materialism.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Materialism is the idea that
the only thing that exists

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.919 align:middle line:84%
is physical stuff,
and everything

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.350 align:middle line:84%
that exists in
every phenomena can

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:45.560 align:middle line:84%
be explained-- from small
particles up to our bodies

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.160 align:middle line:84%
and our minds up to
the cosmos-- they

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:84%
can all be explained
by the known properties

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.100 align:middle line:90%
of the physical world.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's an interesting story
about how we got here in.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:09:00.290 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient world, sort of
the physical world and the mind

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.230 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality were
thought to be all integrated.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.931 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: OK.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And that metaphysic
back then was

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.180 align:middle line:84%
what we might today
call the supernatural,

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.819 align:middle line:90%
or sort of the magical realms.

00:09:09.819 --> 00:09:12.360 align:middle line:84%
But that was the metaphysic that
underlied the belief systems

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.310 align:middle line:90%
back then.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And that persisted up to
about the 17th century,

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:19.580 align:middle line:84%
when the people who were
trying to do science,

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.430 align:middle line:84%
scientists at that time,
were starting to threaten

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.990 align:middle line:90%
the power of the church.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.137 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:26.137 --> 00:09:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: And that didn't
bode well for them,

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.420 align:middle line:90%
as you can imagine.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
is, a philosopher

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.600 align:middle line:84%
named Renee Descartes
came our with this idea

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.070 align:middle line:84%
that you could separate
the natural world

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and the spiritual
world, which to his mind

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.450 align:middle line:84%
included the mind
or consciousness.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And then a short while after
him came this Englishman

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:52.170 align:middle line:84%
with this Adam Curry,
MTV-VJ-looking hair

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.434 align:middle line:84%
called Isaac Newton
who codified some

00:09:54.434 --> 00:09:55.850 align:middle line:84%
of the first
scientific principles

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.580 align:middle line:90%
in math, Newtonian mechanics.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And that was what we call
the classical period.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And the metaphysical assumption
of the classical period

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.110 align:middle line:84%
was dualism, it
was called dualism.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And that persisted up
until about the end

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:13.127 align:middle line:84%
of the 19th century when
Einstein, with relativity,

00:10:13.127 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:84%
suggested that this
isn't really true.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.242 align:middle line:84%
But it really ended the
end of the last century

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:18.200 align:middle line:90%
with quantum mechanics.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And with quantum mechanics
the metaphysical assumptions

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.980 align:middle line:84%
of dualism were replaced
with our current metaphysical

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.330 align:middle line:84%
assumption, which
is materialism.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, I would suggest that,
going all the way back

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.540 align:middle line:84%
to what you'd said before,
one of the problems

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.370 align:middle line:84%
that we see when a certain group
of scientists look at anomalies

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:40.370 align:middle line:84%
and they're
summarily ignored, is

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:44.610 align:middle line:84%
that we're encountering
the precipice

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:49.220 align:middle line:84%
of the end of the metaphysical
assumption of materialism.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And we don't yet have the
new metaphysical assumption

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.089 align:middle line:90%
to replace it.

00:10:57.089 --> 00:10:58.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
it would be called,

00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:59.660 align:middle line:84%
but I can tell you
that it's going

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:00.910 align:middle line:90%
to have a few characteristics.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.284 align:middle line:84%
One is that it's
going to do away

00:11:02.284 --> 00:11:04.380 align:middle line:84%
with this strict
notion of materialism,

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.630 align:middle line:84%
that the only thing that
exists are physical things,

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and the only way they can
behave is through the laws

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.160 align:middle line:84%
that we somehow
know 100 percent of.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.310 align:middle line:90%
That's over.

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing
that it's going to do

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.250 align:middle line:84%
is it's going to
integrate consciousness.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.455 align:middle line:84%
It's going to integrate the
last big mystery of-- well,

00:11:22.455 --> 00:11:23.830 align:middle line:84%
the last big
mystery that we know

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:28.670 align:middle line:84%
of now, which is the nature
of our minds and what mind is.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So we're in this liminal period
right now between materialism

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.540 align:middle line:90%
and whatever comes after it.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's interesting
because, as you noticed,

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.860 align:middle line:84%
for many years I've been reading
about various technologies

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.250 align:middle line:84%
and various studies
and all of this.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And again, this anomaly
keeps popping up, right?

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.633 align:middle line:84%
And I just keep thinking,
it's consciousness, stupid.

00:11:51.633 --> 00:11:53.850 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.826 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But why is there
such a great-- I mean,

00:11:56.826 --> 00:11:57.950 align:middle line:90%
we already know the answer.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:59.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a
rhetorical question.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Why is there such great
fear of tippy-toeing

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:06.800 align:middle line:84%
beyond the boundaries of what
someone's mentor or professor

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.867 align:middle line:90%
once passed down to one?

00:12:09.867 --> 00:12:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: Some people have
said that science advances one

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:12.866 align:middle line:90%
death at a time.

00:12:12.866 --> 00:12:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.710 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: But it's a
complicated answer.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's
fascinating that we

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:24.220 align:middle line:84%
seem to know more about things
that lie very far beyond us--

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.610 align:middle line:84%
the behavior of black
holes and galaxies

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.354 align:middle line:84%
and so forth-- than we know
about the thing that is most

00:12:29.354 --> 00:12:31.270 align:middle line:84%
close to us, which is
our subjective awareness

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.065 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:12:32.065 --> 00:12:34.190 align:middle line:84%
I can break down that
question in a number of ways,

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:35.179 align:middle line:90%
but I'll pick three.

00:12:35.179 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.380 align:middle line:90%


00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: Why hasn't
consciousness

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.470 align:middle line:84%
been an obvious anomaly
that we've looked at before?

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, one is that,
as I mentioned,

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.990 align:middle line:84%
the metaphysical assumptions
belying it-- materialism--

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:53.770 align:middle line:84%
would tell us that we don't
even need to look there,

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:59.380 align:middle line:84%
because our brains are
composed of particles

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:04.990 align:middle line:84%
and therefore our minds are
nothing more than an illusion

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:06.830 align:middle line:90%
produced by the brain.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.980 align:middle line:84%
So we really need
concern ourselves

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.090 align:middle line:84%
with physics and
chemistry and biology,

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.300 align:middle line:84%
but that mind stuff,
that consciousness stuff,

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.980 align:middle line:90%
is just a ghost.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.640 align:middle line:84%
It's just an illusion,
not important.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a tiny
revolution that's

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:24.260 align:middle line:84%
been happening in philosophy,
and that's philosophy of mind.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And to provide the
world's shortest summary,

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.000 align:middle line:90%
it goes something like this.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.090 align:middle line:84%
If consciousness is an
illusion, the question

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.290 align:middle line:90%
becomes, an illusion to whom?

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.270 align:middle line:84%
So you see, you
need consciousness

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:40.890 align:middle line:84%
to be able to experience
anything including illusions.

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:41.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:42.580 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: And that seems
very obvious, right?

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.650 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually--
it hasn't really

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:51.600 align:middle line:84%
dawned so much-- it hasn't
really been taken seriously

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.190 align:middle line:90%
in science yet.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.970 align:middle line:84%
As we've done away
with philosophy

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:56.950 align:middle line:84%
and focused only on
the hard sciences,

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.590 align:middle line:84%
the obvious-- which would be
a teaching from philosophy--

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:01.957 align:middle line:84%
is only starting
to gain traction.

00:14:01.957 --> 00:14:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps people
are starting to see

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.740 align:middle line:84%
that, if you say consciousness
is an illusion you're actually

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.680 align:middle line:84%
presupposing the existence
of the very thing

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.220 align:middle line:90%
you say doesn't exist.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:14.135 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: So it's taken
us awhile to acknowledge

00:14:14.135 --> 00:14:15.843 align:middle line:84%
that philosophy has
something to teach us

00:14:15.843 --> 00:14:16.370 align:middle line:90%
about the hard sciences.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the things
that's just devastating

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:23.125 align:middle line:84%
about the current paradigm is
that a person, say, graduates

00:14:23.125 --> 00:14:25.410 align:middle line:84%
with a degree in philosophy,
maybe it's her Ph.D.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:27.090 align:middle line:84%
In philosophy,
which is considered

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.710 align:middle line:84%
by Wall Street or
the outside world

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.530 align:middle line:90%
as some kind of toilet paper.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:35.120 align:middle line:84%
You might as well toss it and
then get a job as a waiter.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.110 align:middle line:90%
There's no place.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:39.570 align:middle line:84%
There's been no place
made in modern times

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:44.280 align:middle line:84%
for philosophical thought, which
is at the root of everything

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.980 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about here.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.640 align:middle line:84%
So what you just
said is encouraging

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.260 align:middle line:84%
because you see that there is a
place for philosophy beginning

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.160 align:middle line:84%
to emerge again, particularly
as applies to science.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.402 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: There's a huge
place for philosophy,

00:14:56.402 --> 00:14:58.360 align:middle line:84%
especially as it applies
to science, especially

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.022 align:middle line:84%
as it applies to
science right now.

00:15:00.022 --> 00:15:01.980 align:middle line:84%
I talked about how we're
in this liminal period

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.070 align:middle line:84%
between shuffling off the
old metaphysical assumptions

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.450 align:middle line:90%
and taking on something new.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, whenever that happens in
history, what you need to do

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.500 align:middle line:84%
is you need to get your
first principles correct.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.510 align:middle line:84%
So philosophy-- one of the
tool kits from philosophy

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:18.660 align:middle line:84%
is that you can reason
from first principles,

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.350 align:middle line:90%
and you can reason from effect.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.280 align:middle line:84%
So reasoning from
a first principle

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.710 align:middle line:84%
would be getting your
fundamental assumptions

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.490 align:middle line:90%
true and correct.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And if you can
accomplish that, then you

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:33.300 align:middle line:84%
can make little logical
leaps from those fundamental

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.270 align:middle line:84%
assumptions, and
your thinking is

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.800 align:middle line:84%
going to be true and correct
from that point forward.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.880 align:middle line:84%
What happens a lot when
people are incorrect

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.387 align:middle line:90%
is that they reason from effect.

00:15:45.387 --> 00:15:47.720 align:middle line:84%
So they'll look at effects
of something and they'll say,

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.490 align:middle line:84%
well, this is the
fundamental, and they'll

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:50.832 align:middle line:90%
make these category errors.

00:15:50.832 --> 00:15:52.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's more empirical

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Exactly.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And what we think
are first principles

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.100 align:middle line:90%
seems to evolve over time.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.710 align:middle line:84%
In this case, our
first principle

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:08.050 align:middle line:84%
could be synonymous
with whatever

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:11.290 align:middle line:84%
new metaphysical assumption
is coming down our way.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very imperative
that philosophical thinking

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.855 align:middle line:90%
enter our calculations--

00:16:16.855 --> 00:16:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: If you
will, at this point,

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.695 align:middle line:90%
in order to keep us honest.

00:16:20.695 --> 00:16:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:22.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad to
hear you say that.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:23.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.100 align:middle line:84%
We're going to jump
back again to the time

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.780 align:middle line:84%
when you met-- I was asking how
to pronounce his name-- Robert

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.750 align:middle line:90%
Jahn and Brenda Dunne.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about how your
life shifted at that point.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:33.459 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Right.

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:35.750 align:middle line:84%
So actually it was at that
same conference, about which

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:40.590 align:middle line:84%
I was speaking earlier,
that a handful of scientists

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:43.410 align:middle line:84%
approached me and
one was Bob Jahn who

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:47.100 align:middle line:84%
was the dean emeritus of
the engineering school

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.090 align:middle line:84%
at Princeton, very
famous rocket scientist.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:54.110 align:middle line:84%
The man who had created
the whole field, generally,

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:55.324 align:middle line:90%
of plasma physics.

00:16:55.324 --> 00:16:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole generation
of spacecraft flying around

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.510 align:middle line:84%
in space that are essentially
his brain children.

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And his ever-present lab
manager, Brenda Dunne.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.319 align:middle line:84%
And these two were from
the PEAR lab at Princeton.

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:08.859 align:middle line:84%
And PEAR is an
acronym that stands

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:11.210 align:middle line:84%
for Princeton Engineering
Anomalies Research lab.

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:12.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a mouthful.

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:16.810 align:middle line:84%
But basically what it is-- it
was a rigorous parapsychology

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.579 align:middle line:84%
laboratory that existed
at Princeton University

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:23.280 align:middle line:84%
from the '70s up
until the mid 2000s.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.030 align:middle line:84%
It differed from the sort
of classical parapsychology

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:29.650 align:middle line:84%
labs of Duke and so
forth in certain ways.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.290 align:middle line:84%
One, of which is that it took
a very rigorous engineering

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:37.090 align:middle line:84%
perspective to the question
of, what is consciousness

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.150 align:middle line:90%
and what can it do?

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Is it an illusion
encapsulated in the brain,

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.220 align:middle line:90%
or is it something more?

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:48.020 align:middle line:84%
If it's something more, then
presumably we can look to see

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.740 align:middle line:84%
if consciousness can interact
with the physical world in ways

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.940 align:middle line:84%
that cannot be explained
by materialist assumptions.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.760 align:middle line:84%
So the PEAR lab was famous for
setting up these experiments

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.258 align:middle line:90%
to test that.

00:17:59.258 --> 00:18:00.716 align:middle line:84%
Before we get into
that-- you know,

00:18:00.716 --> 00:18:03.380 align:middle line:84%
they told me these stories
when I met Bob and Brenda

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:07.820 align:middle line:84%
and either they took
some sympathy on me

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.730 align:middle line:84%
or it was a cunning
ruse to recruit

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.580 align:middle line:90%
fresh blood as unpaid interns.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There's always that.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:15.660 align:middle line:90%
Then you guys go for it.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.210 align:middle line:90%
We all do.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.960 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: Exactly But
we became fast friends

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and I ended up eventually
spending my summers

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.910 align:middle line:84%
at the PEAR lab at Princeton
participating in various ways

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:26.060 align:middle line:90%
with the laboratory.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.420 align:middle line:84%
In some cases research,
but also just various--

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about some
of the kind of experimentation

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:30.880 align:middle line:90%
that was going on?

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Yeah.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.310 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating stuff.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:35.390 align:middle line:84%
So the PEAR lab was well known
for experiments involving

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:37.530 align:middle line:90%
random number generators.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.660 align:middle line:84%
So a random number generator
is just what it sounds like.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.380 align:middle line:84%
It measures some type of
physical thing in the world--

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.780 align:middle line:84%
so usually it's a
quantum phenomena,

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.700 align:middle line:84%
like electron tunneling
or quantum tunneling--

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.300 align:middle line:84%
and it converts
those measurements

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:57.540 align:middle line:90%
into random numbers, 1s and 0s.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Because of the way that
quantum mechanics works,

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:04.420 align:middle line:84%
the numbers can't be predicted
based on the numbers that

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.460 align:middle line:84%
came after it, so
you end up with this,

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.782 align:middle line:84%
like, fundamentally-- or
intrinsically random bit

00:19:08.782 --> 00:19:09.300 align:middle line:90%
stream.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.410 align:middle line:90%
100110011.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens
that if you look

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:17.740 align:middle line:84%
at the bit stream of this
random number generator

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.460 align:middle line:84%
you get even numbers
of 1s and 0s.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.130 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Everything is right
with the world.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Until you get
somebody to attempt

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:29.600 align:middle line:84%
to affect the machine or the
output of the machine using

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.600 align:middle line:84%
only their intention, only their
consciousness, if you will.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.910 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.580 align:middle line:84%
It produces more 1s or more 0s
depending on their intention.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And it does so in a way that's
statistically significant.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:46.582 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very simple
experiment that's just--

00:19:46.582 --> 00:19:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But profound.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: But profound.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:49.870 align:middle line:90%
But very profound.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:52.680 align:middle line:84%
It's profound because it
flies in the face of all

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.430 align:middle line:84%
the materialist
assumptions at that point,

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and suggests that there is--
we don't know how exactly,

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.380 align:middle line:84%
but there's a very
deep relationship

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.920 align:middle line:84%
between consciousness, between
our subjective reality,

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.320 align:middle line:84%
and the behavior of the
physical world outside of us.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:12.094 align:middle line:84%
At least at those quantum, or
at least those uncertain levels.

00:20:12.094 --> 00:20:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What I find
interesting about that--

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.950 align:middle line:84%
many years ago, probably
about the time you were born,

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.550 align:middle line:84%
I was interviewing Russell
Targ the first time.

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.610 align:middle line:84%
He'd just come back
in the Soviet Union

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:26.030 align:middle line:84%
where they were doing
experiments in remote viewing,

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:29.050 align:middle line:84%
and they were dealing
with random generators,

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:31.550 align:middle line:84%
but the generators were
actually using imagery, just

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:34.010 align:middle line:90%
an assortment of random imagery.

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And the question
became-- and they

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.990 align:middle line:84%
were, as a result of some
of the work-- actually,

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:42.680 align:middle line:84%
I think it was at Duke rather
than Princeton now that I

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.020 align:middle line:90%
think of it.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:48.200 align:middle line:84%
What they were finding
is that the viewer

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.700 align:middle line:84%
was more detailed in
their accuracy viewing

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:52.629 align:middle line:90%
into the future.

00:20:52.629 --> 00:20:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, they didn't know
they were doing that.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.330 align:middle line:84%
They were reporting
what they saw

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and it was revealed later
that the image wasn't

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.090 align:middle line:84%
chosen until four hours
after the image was selected.

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:06.030 align:middle line:84%
So that begs the
question, chicken or egg?

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:07.600 align:middle line:90%
What's going on there?

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:14.002 align:middle line:84%
Did her consciousness choose the
random generation of that image

00:21:14.002 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:84%
then, like what you're
saying, the programming,

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.187 align:middle line:90%
the sequences of 1s and 0s?

00:21:18.187 --> 00:21:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Yeah.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:20.020 align:middle line:90%
That's a really good question.

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.630 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't heard that before.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And the short answer
is, I have no idea.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:29.159 align:middle line:84%
But it illustrates
this kind of-- when

00:21:29.159 --> 00:21:30.700 align:middle line:84%
you're doing these
types of research,

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.910 align:middle line:84%
there's experimenter
effects that you

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:36.920 align:middle line:84%
don't get in classical
science, apparently,

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.780 align:middle line:84%
which confounds
the ability to do

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.770 align:middle line:84%
this stuff in a
strictly-controlled, replicable

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.840 align:middle line:90%
manner.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:50.530 align:middle line:84%
So was she viewing the
future more accurately

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:54.770 align:middle line:84%
or was some aspect of her
subconscious influencing

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.480 align:middle line:84%
the random number generator
to pick the thing that she

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.392 align:middle line:90%
happened to describe?

00:21:59.392 --> 00:22:00.225 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who knows?

00:22:00.225 --> 00:22:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: I don't know.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.019 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:01.019 --> 00:22:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, it's certainly
possible her mind influenced

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.650 align:middle line:84%
it, because her mind was
already beyond time and space

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:08.530 align:middle line:90%
anyway at that point, right?

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.550 align:middle line:84%
If you're remote viewing
you have the ability

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.800 align:middle line:90%
to move beyond time and space.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: Not only that, but
it could be that she described

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.895 align:middle line:84%
a scenario and then
retroactively she caused the--

00:22:19.895 --> 00:22:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:23.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: She caused the
random number generator.

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:27.330 align:middle line:84%
So we-- I didn't, but
the PEAR lab actually did

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:31.670 align:middle line:84%
do some experiments to test
this idea of conscious influence

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:35.220 align:middle line:84%
being extant in--
outside of time,

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.930 align:middle line:90%
so existing before and after.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And in the classical experiment
a person would be seated

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.700 align:middle line:84%
in front of the random number
generator and their intention

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.324 align:middle line:84%
would be to make it produce more
1's, and it would produce more

00:22:48.324 --> 00:22:48.900 align:middle line:90%
1's.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.550 align:middle line:84%
So then they started to move
the person away a little bit.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And it got really far, to
where the person, they called

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.340 align:middle line:84%
the operator, was, you
know, hundreds of miles away

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.050 align:middle line:84%
and intending to
affect the machine,

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:04.115 align:middle line:84%
and it behaved in this
statistically anomalous way.

00:23:04.115 --> 00:23:05.175 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was the same
with the Russian experiment.

00:23:05.175 --> 00:23:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Exactly.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And that evolved into,
OK, well, distance

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.960 align:middle line:90%
doesn't seem to matter.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.360 align:middle line:90%
So what about time?

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually very
easy to test this.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:16.220 align:middle line:84%
You use the random
number generator

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:19.020 align:middle line:90%
to record data ahead of time.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.730 align:middle line:84%
You don't look at
it, so it's still

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:23.280 align:middle line:90%
in this state of uncertainty.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And then sometime
in the future you

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:29.780 align:middle line:84%
ask somebody to affect
the output of the data,

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:30.780 align:middle line:90%
the output of the RNG.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which has already
occurred, theoretically.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: Which has already
occurred in the past.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:34.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, produce
more 1s and more 0s.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
like, often it works.

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And the effect size
is quite large.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Same, too, in the future
you can instruct somebody

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.450 align:middle line:84%
to attempt to affect the
machine in the future

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.460 align:middle line:90%
at some pre-defined point.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.480 align:middle line:84%
They stop, then a couple of
weeks or months in the future

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.040 align:middle line:84%
you run the machine
and behold, you

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.800 align:middle line:90%
get the same types of effects.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:57.510 align:middle line:90%
Very strange.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is very strange.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And I find it fascinating
because we can-- certainly

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.800 align:middle line:84%
our audience watching right
now can accept that you can

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.730 align:middle line:90%
effect events of the future.

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:10.357 align:middle line:84%
I mean, through basic processes
of entropy and so forth.

00:24:10.357 --> 00:24:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Sure.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it's really a
hard stretch for most people

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:19.070 align:middle line:84%
to perceive that we might be
able to affect what's already

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:20.005 align:middle line:90%
occurred, the past.

00:24:20.005 --> 00:24:22.530 align:middle line:90%


00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:24.132 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: I agree.

00:24:24.132 --> 00:24:26.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That makes our
mind bend a little bit more.

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, but I remember it.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.832 align:middle line:84%
It already happened, where the
future is uncertain by nature.

00:24:30.832 --> 00:24:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Exactly.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this case
time doesn't seem

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:39.157 align:middle line:84%
to matter as much because
the past is-- well,

00:24:39.157 --> 00:24:40.740 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
the past in things

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.420 align:middle line:90%
that no one's observed yet.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:45.775 align:middle line:84%
So it's still a set of data
that's in, if you will,

00:24:45.775 --> 00:24:48.590 align:middle line:90%
a state of uncertainty.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So we think of the
past as something

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:55.680 align:middle line:84%
that has been observed
and is proven to be stayed

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.290 align:middle line:90%
and the way it is.

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.720 align:middle line:84%
But you can create situations
where there's uncertainty

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.400 align:middle line:90%
that exist in the past.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.630 align:middle line:84%
You might think of the
future as a probability

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:06.540 align:middle line:90%
function of the present.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And it could be that
the past is somehow

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:11.160 align:middle line:84%
a probability function
of the present too,

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.170 align:middle line:90%
in a very limited sense.

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:16.234 align:middle line:84%
And in that case,
since consciousness

00:25:16.234 --> 00:25:17.650 align:middle line:84%
seems to have this
ability to kind

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.580 align:middle line:84%
of nudge probabilities
this way and that, then

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:23.220 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's not too
much of a stretch

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:25.264 align:middle line:84%
to think that it could
nudge the probabilities

00:25:25.264 --> 00:25:26.680 align:middle line:84%
of a physical
system in the future

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.450 align:middle line:84%
just as it can nudge
the probabilities

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:32.247 align:middle line:84%
of a physical system that
has already done its thing.

00:25:32.247 --> 00:25:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And just that one sentence, that
one explanation could launch

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:40.450 align:middle line:84%
people down a worm hole that
takes lifetimes to really,

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:43.270 align:middle line:84%
fully understand the
implications of, right?

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Probably, yeah.

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:45.978 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, when
you think about it

00:25:45.978 --> 00:25:50.410 align:middle line:84%
from a metaphysical context, if
we can affect our past, which

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:52.540 align:middle line:84%
then affects our
present-- say, if we're

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:56.020 align:middle line:84%
using our own timeline-- if we
affect our own-- if we go back

00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:00.764 align:middle line:84%
and rearrange the past through
consciousness, that creates

00:26:00.764 --> 00:26:02.930 align:middle line:84%
a different outcome for
now, which of course creates

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:05.160 align:middle line:84%
a different outcome
for the future.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And how many people wish
they could go back and just

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:11.890 align:middle line:84%
undo that one thing, or make
that one decision differently?

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:15.540 align:middle line:84%
From what we're saying
here in these experiments,

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.960 align:middle line:84%
that's exactly what
we, theoretically,

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.200 align:middle line:90%
should be able to do.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: At least on
a very small, like,

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.372 align:middle line:84%
bit level, that
could be the case.

00:26:23.372 --> 00:26:25.080 align:middle line:84%
It's fun to think
about though, isn't it?

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.955 align:middle line:84%
Like, there's a lot of
science fiction stores

00:26:26.955 --> 00:26:29.831 align:middle line:84%
where time travelers get
stuck in these time loops

00:26:29.831 --> 00:26:32.080 align:middle line:84%
and have to, like, go back
and do things that affect--

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like
Back to the Future.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.235 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dad, don't.

00:26:34.235 --> 00:26:36.400 align:middle line:90%
Don't make that mistake, Dad.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Which captivated, you
know, millions and millions

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:43.590 align:middle line:84%
of people with the possibility,
the theoretical possibility.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:46.470 align:middle line:84%
So in addition to your
background as a scientist

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:51.680 align:middle line:84%
and a creator, inventory,
all of these things,

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.270 align:middle line:90%
you're also a poet.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
because poets are often

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.934 align:middle line:84%
inspired by things
beyond time and space,

00:26:58.934 --> 00:27:01.100 align:middle line:84%
and they have a unique way
of bringing this through.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.604 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about those
two aspects of your being,

00:27:03.604 --> 00:27:05.020 align:middle line:84%
because one would
say, well, one's

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.490 align:middle line:90%
right brain, one's left brain.

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:07.120 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.859 align:middle line:84%
It appears to me that
you're using equal faculties

00:27:09.859 --> 00:27:11.025 align:middle line:90%
in both of these situations.

00:27:11.025 --> 00:27:13.577 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.577 --> 00:27:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Yeah.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.870 align:middle line:10%
I studied creative
writing in school,

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:19.910 align:middle line:10%
and poetry has always
been a love of mine.

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:21.000 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.450 align:middle line:84%
People are not one-dimensional,
or they don't have to be.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And so-- I'm self-taught in so
many things, in engineering,

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:32.510 align:middle line:84%
and science, and poetry,
which means I'm not

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:33.960 align:middle line:90%
particularly good at anything.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.277 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I doubt that.

00:27:35.277 --> 00:27:37.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: But I have a sort
of broad panoply of interests

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:40.491 align:middle line:90%
and skills.

00:27:40.491 --> 00:27:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, when
I was in school

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:45.830 align:middle line:84%
I was studying physics as
well as creative writing,

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.870 align:middle line:84%
and I would have
assignments for both,

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and I found that if I kind
of got stuck on one thing

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:52.603 align:middle line:84%
I'd work on something else,
and I could come back to it.

00:27:52.603 --> 00:27:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was a challenge,
but at every level

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:58.150 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of, like,
improving my own abilities.

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can
think of the fact

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:02.550 align:middle line:84%
that if we acknowledged
that we are gifted

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:04.860 align:middle line:84%
through this subjective
sort of consciousness,

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.160 align:middle line:84%
the fact that we do have
an attendant subjective

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:11.280 align:middle line:84%
experience, then
things like poetry

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.590 align:middle line:90%
are kind of like dancing in it.

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:19.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a way to savor the
qualia of just being.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And a really good poem allows
readers to do just that.

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is interesting
because poets have always kind

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:31.610 align:middle line:84%
of threatened politicians
throughout history.

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:32.430 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Yeah.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.680 align:middle line:90%
That's a really good point.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.513 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
something that you also

00:28:35.513 --> 00:28:37.390 align:middle line:84%
discusses, is this
notion of societies

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:41.250 align:middle line:84%
being essentially framed
around accepted authority.

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.122 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time
people such as yourself

00:28:43.122 --> 00:28:45.330 align:middle line:84%
and the poets of the world
and the radical scientists

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.040 align:middle line:84%
of the world don't
fall within that,

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.400 align:middle line:84%
and they're often
black-balled, ridiculed,

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.230 align:middle line:90%
and discredited as a result.

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
notion of society's rule

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.420 align:middle line:84%
by accepted authority, and
extended into the world

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.927 align:middle line:84%
that you're dealing
with right now.

00:28:57.927 --> 00:28:58.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Yeah.

00:28:58.510 --> 00:28:59.855 align:middle line:90%
I mean this is an old problem.

00:28:59.855 --> 00:29:02.972 align:middle line:90%


00:29:02.972 --> 00:29:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Human beings themselves are
kind of like-- they have, like,

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:07.070 align:middle line:84%
one foot in the future
and one foot in the past.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:07.910 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:15.010 align:middle line:84%
We're sort of, like, half alien
and half, like, chimpanzee,

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:15.605 align:middle line:90%
in a way.

00:29:15.605 --> 00:29:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And I mean that
only in the sense

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.640 align:middle line:84%
that we are these
liminal creatures,

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:23.600 align:middle line:84%
and that we're partially evolve
but partially caveman-like.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.846 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you see,
we live in a modern world

00:29:25.846 --> 00:29:27.220 align:middle line:84%
with great technology
and things,

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:32.080 align:middle line:84%
but you can see, perhaps,
areas where we still

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.480 align:middle line:90%
have yet to develop.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:40.100 align:middle line:84%
One of these is, we are
very quick to allow rulers

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.330 align:middle line:84%
in our lives and to give
over our personal authority.

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And I understand
why to some extent,

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:48.270 align:middle line:84%
it's facile to have somebody in
charge of things in our life,

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:51.020 align:middle line:90%
but that can get out of hand.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's a
very common fallacy

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.020 align:middle line:84%
that everyone knows about, which
is the appeal to authority.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And everyone uses
it, even people

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.140 align:middle line:90%
in consciousness research.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's dangerous
because, if you

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:03.460 align:middle line:84%
don't look at things
yourself and if you

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.520 align:middle line:84%
don't question things
that "everybody knows,"

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:09.960 align:middle line:84%
then you can end up operating
from an incorrect set

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.080 align:middle line:90%
of first principles.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.790 align:middle line:84%
You can reason from effects
that someone else gives you

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:18.287 align:middle line:84%
and you can end up in a really
bad situations pretty quick.

00:30:18.287 --> 00:30:18.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And we're being
perpetually manipulated,

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:25.740 align:middle line:84%
whether it's for
corporate gain or whatnot,

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.850 align:middle line:84%
the populace of this
planet is constantly

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:33.084 align:middle line:84%
being manipulated to accept
a certain set of parameters

00:30:33.084 --> 00:30:35.250 align:middle line:84%
as their boundaries of their
life and their thinking

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:36.260 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And for purposes of
ruling over people,

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:42.340 align:middle line:84%
I can see that there
would be a benefit

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.970 align:middle line:84%
to whoever wants
to, essentially,

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:45.700 align:middle line:90%
control the masses.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.960 align:middle line:84%
But for the individual,
imagine what

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.530 align:middle line:84%
happens when you start stepping
beyond these space-time

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.020 align:middle line:84%
boundaries, when
you start stepping

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.500 align:middle line:84%
into pure consciousness,
and then you

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.280 align:middle line:84%
start stepping into
consciousness that has

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.440 align:middle line:90%
the ability to alter matter.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Which, we're doing it all the
time anyway in subtle ways,

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:04.590 align:middle line:84%
even within our own
human body and such.

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So I know that's kind of a
broad, sweeping statement,

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:11.290 align:middle line:84%
but I want to start
backing into your app,

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:13.710 align:middle line:84%
into the Consciousness
app from there.

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:17.660 align:middle line:84%
You're presenting something
that is paradigm-shifting,

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:21.150 align:middle line:84%
as I'm understanding it
and gives some power back

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:21.800 align:middle line:90%
to the people.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.510 align:middle line:84%
I also want to ask you
about what the dark side

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:25.440 align:middle line:84%
implications could
possibly be, because we

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.400 align:middle line:90%
want to know that, too.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Right.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.940 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, what do
we do with this research?

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:36.150 align:middle line:84%
We have something like 1,000
rigorous peer reviewed studies

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:39.900 align:middle line:84%
that show that clairvoyance,
telepathy, psychokinesis,

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:42.290 align:middle line:84%
whatever, like,
this stuff is real.

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:46.440 align:middle line:84%
On the order of-- a collective
probability on the order of 1.3

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.300 align:middle line:90%
times 10 to the 104th, right?

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Which, a scientist
estimated the number

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:53.980 align:middle line:84%
of atoms in the known
universe as something like 10

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:54.544 align:middle line:90%
to the 83rd.

00:31:54.544 --> 00:31:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is even
greater than that.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:56.830 align:middle line:90%
So, OK.

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Like, consciousness can do
things and we can't explain it.

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:02.220 align:middle line:84%
So what you're suggesting
there in your first point

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.700 align:middle line:90%
is, so what?

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.150 align:middle line:90%
Like, what do we do about it?

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or being manipulated
away from doing anything,

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.700 align:middle line:84%
and now is kind of
a-- I don't know.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:13.320 align:middle line:84%
I see it as a
dividing time where

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:16.440 align:middle line:84%
we can choose to start
working with these discoveries

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and principles, or--
it's not very good

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:22.920 align:middle line:84%
trajectory if we choose
not to embrace this.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Yes.

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's go
on your trajectory.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: OK.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:27.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.270 align:middle line:84%
I do think that it's
important that we embrace it.

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:34.660 align:middle line:84%
First, because it's the truth,
but second because if we

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:39.960 align:middle line:84%
internalize, as perhaps we have
the ideas of materialism, which

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.140 align:middle line:84%
is to say, as Richard
Dawkins once put it,

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:45.190 align:middle line:84%
that we are lumbering
robots blindly programmed

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:48.902 align:middle line:84%
by our genes, then what is
the purpose of treating one

00:32:48.902 --> 00:32:50.110 align:middle line:90%
another fairly, and what is--

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:50.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:51.410 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Not my favorite author,
scientist, whatever.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: And I don't
think a lot of people

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:57.780 align:middle line:90%
really believe that anyway.

00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:00.030 align:middle line:90%
But it illustrates a point.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we can bring back
renewed respect for one another

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:08.000 align:middle line:84%
by sort of internalizing the
teachings of consciousness

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.320 align:middle line:90%
research, if you will.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:14.280 align:middle line:84%
A second reason that requires
people to sort of come

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.380 align:middle line:84%
out and promote consciousness
research in the sciences

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.390 align:middle line:84%
and elsewhere is,
it's very clear

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:23.890 align:middle line:84%
that society develops
in accord with what

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:25.080 align:middle line:90%
they think is possible.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:26.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: So no social
leader, no scientist,

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:32.370 align:middle line:84%
no inventor is going to
try anything new if they

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:34.910 align:middle line:84%
think there's not a
chance it could work.

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:38.790 align:middle line:84%
But if we understand that what
these experiments are telling

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:42.780 align:middle line:84%
us, for example, that there
might be something more to us

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:46.440 align:middle line:84%
then suddenly there is a chance
that whatever new thing they

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.420 align:middle line:84%
invent, whatever new
system they build,

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:51.070 align:middle line:84%
whatever new organization
they try to build

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:53.990 align:middle line:84%
can succeed along these levels,
then they're going to try it.

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, it's
going to work.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:00.430 align:middle line:84%
So I suppose that, in a small
way, what I'm working on

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:03.640 align:middle line:84%
with the Consciousness app, or
the consciousness technology,

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.219 align:middle line:90%
is my own expression of that.

00:34:05.219 --> 00:34:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.520 align:middle line:84%
So let's dive in
and find out what

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:12.590 align:middle line:84%
that is, why you've done it,
what it is, how it works,

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:14.819 align:middle line:90%
what its potentials are.

00:34:14.819 --> 00:34:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: Well, for
the past few years

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.770 align:middle line:84%
I've been kind of combining
my inventor and tech

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:22.850 align:middle line:84%
side with the side of me
that's interested in conscience

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:26.190 align:middle line:84%
research to create,
I guess, what I'm

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:28.560 align:middle line:84%
calling consciousness
technology.

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And in a nutshell, if we
know from the experiments

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:36.170 align:middle line:84%
that our minds can interface
with the physical world

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:38.900 align:middle line:84%
in these new ways,
then presumably you

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:42.460 align:middle line:84%
can create brand new
kinds of technologies

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:46.909 align:middle line:84%
that utilizes this
interface to do new things.

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:51.540 align:middle line:84%
In other words, mind-influenced
technology, of technology

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.986 align:middle line:84%
that responds to consciousness,
but not by putting electrodes

00:34:54.986 --> 00:34:56.610 align:middle line:84%
on the scalp and
measuring brain waves,

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:58.569 align:middle line:84%
but by something
completely different.

00:34:58.569 --> 00:34:59.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:00.734 align:middle line:84%
First, let's back up
for just a second.

00:35:00.734 --> 00:35:02.100 align:middle line:90%
Where did you get this idea?

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.330 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what was your epiphany?

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: I had the idea
very close to when I first

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:09.830 align:middle line:84%
heard about this research,
which was-- you know,

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:12.690 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing this
stuff for half my life.

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:16.404 align:middle line:84%
And the idea had existed
well before even I was born.

00:35:16.404 --> 00:35:18.570 align:middle line:84%
You can read some of the
texts of, like, Dean Radin,

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:19.160 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:20.780 align:middle line:10%
I was just going
to bring him up.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.680 align:middle line:10%
>>CURRY: And so
people who become

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.680 align:middle line:10%
convinced that this
research is real,

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.060 align:middle line:10%
the next question is, what
are the applications that

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.010 align:middle line:10%
can be built from it?

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm lucky,
I suppose, in that

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:38.291 align:middle line:84%
I live in San Francisco in the
middle of the tech Renaissance,

00:35:38.291 --> 00:35:40.540 align:middle line:84%
and we're all walking around
with these supercomputers

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:44.200 align:middle line:84%
in our pockets
called smart phones.

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And so a few years ago
I wrote a research grant

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:50.880 align:middle line:84%
from a Portuguese
Research Foundation

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.820 align:middle line:84%
called the BL Foundation,
which gave me some money

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:59.500 align:middle line:84%
to prototype a true random
number generator technology

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.067 align:middle line:90%
on the iPhone, on smartphone.

00:36:02.067 --> 00:36:03.650 align:middle line:84%
So the idea there
was that if we could

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:06.190 align:middle line:84%
create a good random
number generator

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:10.460 align:middle line:84%
source then a person's
intention can actually affect--

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.947 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you could do
your own PEARs experiments.

00:36:12.947 --> 00:36:13.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Yeah.

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:15.790 align:middle line:84%
You could do your own,
like, PEAR experiments.

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Or you could do any other type
of mind-matter interaction

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:22.420 align:middle line:84%
thing that you
might conceive of.

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:24.040 align:middle line:90%
And we did.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:24.950 align:middle line:90%
It was successful.

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:28.760 align:middle line:84%
At that time there was a
research and development

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:32.057 align:middle line:84%
company called Psyleron that
had come out of the PEAR lab.

00:36:32.057 --> 00:36:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.550 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about Psyleron.

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:34.590 align:middle line:90%
That's a part of your story.

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:35.173 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Yeah.

00:36:35.173 --> 00:36:40.400 align:middle line:84%
So the PEAR lab closed in 2007,
and myself and some friends

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.550 align:middle line:84%
built this company called
Psyleron out of the PEAR lab.

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And we originally just wanted to
create random number generator

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:50.810 align:middle line:84%
tools, like, simple USB
random number generator stuff

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:53.190 align:middle line:84%
that people could
purchase for a low price

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:55.730 align:middle line:84%
and continue the research
that PEAR was doing.

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And the interest and the
demand for these products

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:00.830 align:middle line:90%
was much higher than we thought.

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:03.720 align:middle line:84%
So we ended up creating a
whole new class of products.

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who was the demand by?

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:09.529 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: Generally it's
by the interested public.

00:37:09.529 --> 00:37:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:12.539 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: So there are
some universities.

00:37:12.539 --> 00:37:13.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Probably a dozen or so around
the world who are doing this

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.832 align:middle line:84%
type of consciousness
research, but there's--

00:37:18.832 --> 00:37:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mostly
individual basis though?

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:22.139 align:middle line:84%
Most of the interest
was individuals?

00:37:22.139 --> 00:37:22.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Yes.

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.260 align:middle line:84%
Just Thousands of
people who want

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.380 align:middle line:84%
to have a hands-on experience
of what we're talking about.

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:32.470 align:middle line:84%
So we built the hardware
for that, and provided that.

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Through Psyleron
is where we also

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:37.120 align:middle line:90%
developed the app technology.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:41.250 align:middle line:84%
So we got this app
built, and it works

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:45.100 align:middle line:84%
by using the accelerometer
inside the phone.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.920 align:middle line:84%
This is a very sensitive
physical thing,

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.060 align:middle line:84%
and if you take the least
significant bit of this

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.150 align:middle line:84%
and do some
processing to it, you

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:56.060 align:middle line:84%
can end up with a really
good random bit stream.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And we distributed
this to our friends

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:00.320 align:middle line:84%
and they did a little
experiment where

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.090 align:middle line:84%
they would collect a baseline
data, where they weren't

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:07.010 align:middle line:84%
trying to influence the random
number generator on the phone.

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:08.540 align:middle line:90%
It was flat.

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And then we asked them to
pre-state whether or not

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:12.850 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to produce
more 1s of more 0s

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:15.820 align:middle line:84%
by tapping up or down,
and they did, and then

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:19.140 align:middle line:84%
they would attempt to nudge
the thing with their thoughts.

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of these
series of experiments

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.460 align:middle line:84%
their data was sent back to a
central server where we put it

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.470 align:middle line:90%
all together and analyzed it.

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:28.820 align:middle line:90%
And it worked.

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.770 align:middle line:84%
We saw the same type of
consciousness-correlated

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:35.150 align:middle line:84%
signatures that we
saw in the PEAR lab.

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:38.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is the
accelerometer-- what part of it

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:42.140 align:middle line:84%
was doing the
sensing of the field?

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:45.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I assume it was not
coming through the bio-field.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.650 align:middle line:90%
It's coming through the field.

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:48.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:49.270 align:middle line:90%
So I mean-- Yeah.

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Yeah.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:53.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the question
that most people want to know,

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.850 align:middle line:84%
is what is the mechanism by
which our minds could possibly

00:38:56.850 --> 00:39:01.880 align:middle line:84%
have any influence over,
like, random randomness?

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, no
one knows, so I'll

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:06.322 align:middle line:90%
spare you a lengthy answer.

00:39:06.322 --> 00:39:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No one knows?

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.113 align:middle line:90%
But you invented it.

00:39:08.113 --> 00:39:09.690 align:middle line:90%
You have to know.

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:11.820 align:middle line:90%
It didn't just randomly happen.

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.070 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: It's really
funny to work in a field

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:17.010 align:middle line:84%
where you can build stuff and
you don't know how it works.

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:21.330 align:middle line:90%
But, that's true, honestly.

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Of course everybody
has their theory

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:26.522 align:middle line:84%
about what consciousness
is and how it

00:39:26.522 --> 00:39:27.730 align:middle line:90%
can interface with the world.

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's so fun
about working this field,

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.181 align:middle line:84%
is that everyone
has their own theory

00:39:31.181 --> 00:39:33.270 align:middle line:84%
and they really
want to tell you.

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:35.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm a bit theory-agnostic.

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:38.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how our
minds are capable,

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:41.032 align:middle line:84%
for example, of influencing
random number generators.

00:39:41.032 --> 00:39:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, it
makes sense, as I'm just

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:45.323 align:middle line:84%
thinking about it, or kind
of playing with it in my head

00:39:45.323 --> 00:39:48.610 align:middle line:84%
anyway, that you're talking
about bits of data, whatever

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:50.470 align:middle line:84%
those bits of data
look like, whether it's

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:52.850 align:middle line:84%
just 1s and 0s,
imagery and so forth.

00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And if the mind is
out in the field,

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:56.511 align:middle line:84%
why would not be
intercepting, influencing,

00:39:56.511 --> 00:39:57.760 align:middle line:90%
and working with bits of data?

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.343 align:middle line:84%
That's what it's doing all the
time anyway organically, right?

00:40:00.343 --> 00:40:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Right.

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:04.540 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
we tend to think

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:11.920 align:middle line:84%
about forces as these
things that start at a point

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.340 align:middle line:90%
and like spread out.

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:15.920 align:middle line:84%
So an electromagnetic
forces is, like--

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.655 align:middle line:84%
you've got this electromagnet in
it, sends out electromagnetic--

00:40:18.655 --> 00:40:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the brain is
electromagnetic by nature.

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Right.

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
tendency to maybe think

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.490 align:middle line:84%
of the consciousness
effect as, like,

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:29.060 align:middle line:84%
something that's coming out
of our heads or whatever,

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:31.140 align:middle line:90%
but that's clearly not true.

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:33.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not true because time
and space don't seem to--

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's coming
from a larger field, yeah.

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:37.068 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: It's more
proper, I think,

00:40:37.068 --> 00:40:43.370 align:middle line:84%
to conceive of this force
as an informational field,

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:45.380 align:middle line:84%
rather than a physical
field like that.

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:46.146 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:40:46.146 --> 00:40:47.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: Now what
does that mean?

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.190 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:52.860 align:middle line:84%
But just to kind
of get our, like,

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:55.890 align:middle line:84%
the way that we visualize
these things correctly,

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:58.470 align:middle line:84%
it's more likely
characterized as some type

00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:02.410 align:middle line:84%
of informational force that's
making this stuff happen.

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
It's interesting because

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:07.120 align:middle line:84%
about a year, a
year and half ago I

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:11.420 align:middle line:84%
interviewed a man who is in
a totally esoteric field.

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:15.696 align:middle line:84%
He was the inventor of the
online site astrology.com,

00:41:15.696 --> 00:41:17.520 align:middle line:90%
taro.com, and so forth.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, he sold it, turned
that over to other people,

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:26.650 align:middle line:84%
and decided to put his time
and money into creating an app.

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And you think, OK, parlor
game, but it's rather uncanny,

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:36.410 align:middle line:84%
actually, in that he did an
I Ching oracle type of app.

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:41.125 align:middle line:84%
And so once you tap into the
program, you pose a question.

00:41:41.125 --> 00:41:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And it said either write it
but really hold it, pose it,

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:44.620 align:middle line:90%
think about it.

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And then again, tapping,
tapping the screen

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:50.360 align:middle line:84%
you start bringing up the six
I Ching lines, broken or solid.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:53.506 align:middle line:84%
What happened the very first
day blew all of our minds,

00:41:53.506 --> 00:41:55.130 align:middle line:84%
because it happened
to someone in here,

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:58.160 align:middle line:84%
and it told the exact thing that
happened to her the next day.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- and I have
found-- every now and then

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:02.720 align:middle line:84%
I'll play with it and
it's like, god, how can it

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:06.190 align:middle line:84%
get that, no less do
the exact same one twice

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:09.230 align:middle line:84%
when a clear message is
trying to get through to you

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:10.750 align:middle line:90%
on an app?

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:13.550 align:middle line:84%
The field, working
with technology.

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Yeah.

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:15.850 align:middle line:90%
That's a good example.

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:18.737 align:middle line:84%
What you might also be
describing is synchronicity.

00:42:18.737 --> 00:42:19.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.278 align:middle line:90%
We can talk about that.

00:42:20.278 --> 00:42:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: So synchronicity
can be a lot of things.

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:26.970 align:middle line:84%
It can be getting a message
from an I Ching app,

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:29.370 align:middle line:84%
it can be opening
a fortune cookie

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:31.905 align:middle line:84%
and getting a very
prudent message.

00:42:31.905 --> 00:42:32.405 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, it can,
where you attracted

00:42:32.405 --> 00:42:33.500 align:middle line:90%
that particular message.

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:34.333 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Yeah, yeah.

00:42:34.333 --> 00:42:37.755 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be
thinking about somebody

00:42:37.755 --> 00:42:39.380 align:middle line:84%
with whom you haven't
spoken in a while

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:41.830 align:middle line:90%
and they call you on the phone.

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:43.086 align:middle line:90%
Stories abound.

00:42:43.086 --> 00:42:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's
still a resonance field.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:50.225 align:middle line:84%
I mean, synchronicity, seems to
me, has to deal with resonance.

00:42:50.225 --> 00:42:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: It could be.

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:52.560 align:middle line:90%
It could be.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people
experience these things

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.780 align:middle line:84%
by words that we use,
like, called resonance.

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:02.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a feeling that
perhaps goes along with this.

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And we use these terms like
resonance, and the field,

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:07.427 align:middle line:90%
and so forth to describe it.

00:43:07.427 --> 00:43:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not that's
actually the mechanism

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.540 align:middle line:90%
is still unknown to people.

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:12.521 align:middle line:90%
But that's OK.

00:43:12.521 --> 00:43:13.146 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:13.146 --> 00:43:15.187 align:middle line:84%
Functionally speaking,
that's what it feels like.

00:43:15.187 --> 00:43:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Exactly.

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:18.024 align:middle line:84%
You know, synchronicity
is an interesting one

00:43:18.024 --> 00:43:20.390 align:middle line:84%
in the context of what
we've been discussing,

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:22.599 align:middle line:84%
especially when it comes to
the idea of consciousness

00:43:22.599 --> 00:43:23.098 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:43:23.098 --> 00:43:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you some
interesting stories.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do.

00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: When we
were at Psyleron

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:35.790 align:middle line:84%
we set up this system that had a
random number generator running

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:38.950 align:middle line:84%
for each of us that worked
at the company, all the time.

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And whenever the random number
generator produced a spike

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:47.240 align:middle line:84%
in its data it would send an
alert to our mobile phone.

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:50.700 align:middle line:84%
So we'd get a text message
that says, you know, spike.

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And what was really funny
is that we'd be going around

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:57.750 align:middle line:84%
throughout our day and we'd
start to talk about this system

00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:01.551 align:middle line:84%
we'd set up, and we get
this message, spike.

00:44:01.551 --> 00:44:02.800 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh, that's curious.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you
were connecting.

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:06.124 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: Yeah, when we
were talking about it.

00:44:06.124 --> 00:44:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we'd be having a
really good dinner conversation

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.300 align:middle line:84%
with our friends and we were
like, there was that resonance,

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:14.535 align:middle line:90%
as you said, right?

00:44:14.535 --> 00:44:16.630 align:middle line:84%
That kind of feeling,
whatever it is, and we'd

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:18.330 align:middle line:90%
get this message, spike.

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:20.100 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's really interesting.

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:22.800 align:middle line:84%
So we thought, how
can we extend this?

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.660 align:middle line:84%
So instead of this
"spike" message,

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:28.660 align:middle line:84%
we put in a series
of other messages.

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:31.790 align:middle line:84%
I think a bunch of them I
got from fortune cookies,

00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:37.040 align:middle line:84%
like, watch out, or
call someone you love,

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:40.810 align:middle line:84%
or I know you're thinking
about me, is another.

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is that
we would get these messages

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:48.250 align:middle line:84%
at times that were synchronistic
to what we were doing

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:50.594 align:middle line:90%
or thinking at that moment.

00:44:50.594 --> 00:44:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Especially the one, I know
you're thinking about me,

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.260 align:middle line:84%
because when we'd
talk about SyncTXT

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.160 align:middle line:84%
we'd start getting
this-- we called it

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.420 align:middle line:84%
SyncTXT, or synchronicity
text messaging.

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, we'd get these messages
and-- this was an example,

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:04.630 align:middle line:84%
I think, of this
age-old question

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:07.590 align:middle line:90%
about what synchronicity is.

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:11.764 align:middle line:84%
Are meaningful coincidences
just random events on which

00:45:11.764 --> 00:45:14.180 align:middle line:84%
we retrofit meaning, because
we want there to be something

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:15.500 align:middle line:90%
more, but it's just random?

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Or is there some part of
our minds or some part

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:20.230 align:middle line:84%
of our consciousness
that's conspiring

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:22.440 align:middle line:84%
to sort of bring
two things together

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.730 align:middle line:90%
in some meaningful way?

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, perhaps this
is an example,

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:29.070 align:middle line:84%
at least in this limited
case, of synchronicity

00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:33.150 align:middle line:84%
being a consciousness-driven
phenomenon, to some extent.

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:34.820 align:middle line:10%
And so we built
this product called

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:37.200 align:middle line:10%
SyncTXT which allows people
to sign up and actually

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.709 align:middle line:10%
have real random number
generators control messages.

00:45:39.709 --> 00:45:40.500 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: How cool.

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.050 align:middle line:10%
>>CURRY: And so
thousands of people

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:44.870 align:middle line:10%
now are experiencing
synchronicities

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:46.990 align:middle line:10%
through a technology
that we created.

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:50.220 align:middle line:84%
So consciousness technology
is, at least, alive

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:51.010 align:middle line:90%
and well as is--

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: SyncTXT.

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: SyncTXT, yeah.

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:54.668 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And anyone
can-- you can download it?

00:45:54.668 --> 00:45:56.942 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can go to an
app store and find it?

00:45:56.942 --> 00:45:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: It's not an
app, it's a website.

00:45:58.650 --> 00:45:59.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's a website, OK.

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: You just go in and
you put in your mobile phone,

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.405 align:middle line:90%
and you can select messages.

00:46:03.405 --> 00:46:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's
interesting is, you're

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:07.642 align:middle line:84%
talking about that-- so you're
randomly going about your day.

00:46:07.642 --> 00:46:09.600 align:middle line:84%
You're just doing your
day, and each one of you

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.390 align:middle line:84%
had your random
generator, right?

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:15.570 align:middle line:84%
When you were getting the
spikes, did you at some point

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:19.050 align:middle line:84%
decide to actively go
into observance of,

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:21.840 align:middle line:84%
what was I just feeling
or thinking in the moment?

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.280 align:middle line:90%
Question number one.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Question number two, was it
more what you were thinking

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:29.830 align:middle line:84%
or what you were
feeling that was causing

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:34.390 align:middle line:84%
the spikes, the level of
intensity of passion, emotion,

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:37.370 align:middle line:84%
beyond emotion, more
sublime emotion,

00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:41.180 align:middle line:84%
like, yes, that's
really interesting?

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:42.380 align:middle line:90%
Which one was it?

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:43.921 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: Well, one
of the things that

00:46:43.921 --> 00:46:46.800 align:middle line:84%
seems very clear
about-- that comes out

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.490 align:middle line:84%
of the research and about the
anecdotal experiences of people

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:51.250 align:middle line:84%
that use things like
SyncTXT is that this

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:54.340 align:middle line:84%
is a subconsciously-driven
phenomenon.

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And you get the
strongest effects

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.540 align:middle line:84%
when you're experiencing
some kind of meaningfulness.

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:01.460 align:middle line:90%
Now, that could be an emotion.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And usually meaningful things
have attendant emotions, right?

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's hard to say whether
or not it's what you're doing

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:09.295 align:middle line:84%
or what you're feeling--
what you're thinking

00:47:09.295 --> 00:47:13.490 align:middle line:84%
or what you're feeling, but it's
generally a meaningful thing

00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:15.365 align:middle line:90%
in which you have both.

00:47:15.365 --> 00:47:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:20.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because oftentimes
thought precedes emotion,

00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:22.630 align:middle line:90%
and so it precipitates emotion.

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Something passes
through an image, passes

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:26.199 align:middle line:84%
through a remembrance,
boom, the emotion's

00:47:26.199 --> 00:47:29.010 align:middle line:84%
there which, essentially,
that's subconscious mind.

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:32.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a body of kind of
emotionally-generated

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:35.020 align:middle line:84%
signatures, so to speak,
information, data.

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.710 align:middle line:84%
But most of it's
emotionally driven

00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:40.800 align:middle line:84%
rather than mind-driven,
intellectually driven,

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.320 align:middle line:90%
let's say.

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Right.

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:44.190 align:middle line:84%
For example, there's
a couple of users

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:49.190 align:middle line:84%
who have messages that they can
receive in SyncTXT that say,

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:50.680 align:middle line:90%
don't eat that.

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And according to the stories
that they've shared with us,

00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.270 align:middle line:84%
they tend to get this message
when they're considering

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:57.270 align:middle line:90%
breaking their diet.

00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:47:58.070 --> 00:47:58.810 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:47:58.810 --> 00:47:59.070 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:47:59.070 --> 00:47:59.820 align:middle line:90%
That's not random.

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:02.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: So that's not an
emotionally meaningful thing,

00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:04.300 align:middle line:84%
but it's meaningful
to them in the sense

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:06.791 align:middle line:84%
that some part of themselves
knows what's right for them.

00:48:06.791 --> 00:48:08.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
also when you're

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:10.170 align:middle line:84%
thinking of eating something
that you have said to yourself

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:12.725 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to eat, that's
usually an emotional drive.

00:48:12.725 --> 00:48:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Right.

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not, gee, I think
I will have that fudge pudding

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:17.040 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:17.540 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:19.075 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh my
god, I want that.

00:48:19.075 --> 00:48:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Right.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.366 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
dealing with desire,

00:48:21.366 --> 00:48:22.850 align:middle line:90%
you're dealing with emotion.

00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Those are really-- that
has a lot of body to it,

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:26.280 align:middle line:90%
energetically.

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Yeah.

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:28.150 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:30.710 align:middle line:90%
So my consciousness app.

00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:33.120 align:middle line:10%
It's called Collective
Consciousness

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:36.990 align:middle line:10%
and it's going to bring in a
number of different, really

00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:39.160 align:middle line:10%
interesting consciousness
research and experience

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.740 align:middle line:10%
components into it.

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:45.570 align:middle line:84%
We're almost close to raising
the money and getting it built,

00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:47.310 align:middle line:84%
but you can look for
it in about 2015.

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's the mission?

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:49.750 align:middle line:84%
What are you intending
to do with it?

00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:50.333 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Yeah.

00:48:50.333 --> 00:48:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, the mission is to
be the world's largest

00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:53.640 align:middle line:84%
consciousness
research experiment,

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:55.889 align:middle line:84%
and to give people a hands-on
experience of everything

00:48:55.889 --> 00:48:59.280 align:middle line:90%
we've been talking about today.

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And it works using real
random number generators

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:06.200 align:middle line:84%
and can do things like
send messages to the user,

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:08.790 align:middle line:84%
but an individual
can opt to have

00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:13.770 align:middle line:84%
their own local random
number generator data sent

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:16.650 align:middle line:84%
to our central servers
where we can look for things

00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:19.550 align:middle line:84%
like whether or not collective
consciousness is actually

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:24.790 align:middle line:84%
a real thing by looking at
the covariance of the data

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:26.962 align:middle line:84%
from all of these data
points, all of these people

00:49:26.962 --> 00:49:27.670 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:29.420 align:middle line:84%
We can do all kinds
of amazing experiments

00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:32.140 align:middle line:84%
to look at-- this
is similar, perhaps,

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:33.686 align:middle line:84%
to the global
consciousness project.

00:49:33.686 --> 00:49:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:37.310 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask
you about that next.

00:49:37.310 --> 00:49:38.435 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: But has a--

00:49:38.435 --> 00:49:40.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does it have a
predictive element to it?

00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:42.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: That's something
that we could test.

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:44.624 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because then when
you look at that-- now if you

00:49:44.624 --> 00:49:47.227 align:middle line:90%
look at sinister agendas, aha.

00:49:47.227 --> 00:49:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Here's an app, and you have
all these people willingly--

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:53.270 align:middle line:84%
just like 23andMe, we're all
giving our DNA or our blood

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:56.430 align:middle line:84%
samples and being profiled
genetically and such,

00:49:56.430 --> 00:50:04.120 align:middle line:84%
and people are, you know--
So is there a possibility

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:06.540 align:middle line:84%
that after you do this thing
that you're passionate about

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:10.660 align:middle line:84%
and it's so lovely, that it can
be co-opted for other purposes?

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:12.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: I don't think so.

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't see any way that
that's really possible at all.

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
that's good to hear.

00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Because when I hear
how brilliant you are

00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:20.040 align:middle line:84%
and what you're coming
up with, I think,

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:21.720 align:middle line:84%
many of the people
I've interviewed

00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:27.660 align:middle line:84%
have had the experience of
being radically genius inventors

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:28.800 align:middle line:90%
of cutting-edge stuff.

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, you
have people showing up

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:33.320 align:middle line:84%
on their doorsteps, you have
the intelligence agency,

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:37.110 align:middle line:84%
the NSA, people like this
showing up, essentially,

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:39.900 align:middle line:84%
and saying, hey, we could
use a little cooperation

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:41.220 align:middle line:90%
on your technology.

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.150 align:middle line:84%
You haven't had to
deal with that yet?

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:45.608 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: Well, fortunately for
me I'm not a radical genius,

00:50:45.608 --> 00:50:46.194 align:middle line:90%
so--

00:50:46.194 --> 00:50:47.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, that's modest.

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:47.950 align:middle line:90%
But, OK.

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: They won't
show up on my doorstep.

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're not
going to bother you.

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:50.650 align:middle line:84%
So you haven't had
to deal with it.

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:52.108 align:middle line:84%
Your group and none
of these people

00:50:52.108 --> 00:50:55.090 align:middle line:84%
have had to deal with
any kind of inquiry

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:56.970 align:middle line:84%
by intelligence
communities and such?

00:50:56.970 --> 00:50:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Well, I haven't.

00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:01.140 align:middle line:84%
I haven't experienced anything
like that, personally.

00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:03.580 align:middle line:84%
But many of the
parapsychology research

00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:05.175 align:middle line:90%
labs they come out of the '70s.

00:51:05.175 --> 00:51:07.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you couldn't
do that stuff.

00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, Russel
Targ, that was CIA.

00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.393 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: And a lot of them
were actually created and run

00:51:11.393 --> 00:51:11.927 align:middle line:90%
by people.

00:51:11.927 --> 00:51:13.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: By intelligence.

00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:13.750 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'm wondering.

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:15.708 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're kind of
the new version of that.

00:51:15.708 --> 00:51:17.700 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Right.

00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:23.277 align:middle line:84%
Either these groups know a
lot more than what I'm doing.

00:51:23.277 --> 00:51:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's possible.

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:26.359 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: So my technology
is like cart and buggy

00:51:26.359 --> 00:51:27.710 align:middle line:90%
compared to what they have.

00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:28.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so though.

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:30.376 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
they learned anything

00:51:30.376 --> 00:51:32.250 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't learn
in the civilian sector.

00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:34.314 align:middle line:84%
I think that they went
on a wild goose chase

00:51:34.314 --> 00:51:35.730 align:middle line:84%
thinking that if
they could change

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:38.030 align:middle line:84%
this variable, that
variable, this variable,

00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:39.950 align:middle line:84%
and try to get stronger
"effect sizes,"

00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:41.460 align:middle line:84%
and try to engineer
consciousness.

00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:41.810 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:43.601 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness isn't an
engineering problem.

00:51:43.601 --> 00:51:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: You might
get stronger, like,

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:50.510 align:middle line:84%
effects or better remote
viewers for, like, a few weeks

00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:53.660 align:middle line:84%
by tweaking x, and then the
novelty of that wears off

00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:56.060 align:middle line:90%
and the decline effect sets in.

00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:59.326 align:middle line:84%
And just like it does in all
types of experiments like this,

00:51:59.326 --> 00:52:00.700 align:middle line:84%
you're back to
where you started.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:01.832 align:middle line:90%
So no, I think that--

00:52:01.832 --> 00:52:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't you
think you're breaking

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:08.379 align:middle line:84%
the boundary beyond that kind
of ability to be controlled?

00:52:08.379 --> 00:52:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: I think that it's
notoriously different to put

00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:12.760 align:middle line:90%
a box around consciousness.

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:14.440 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:14.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:17.680 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk about the
Global Consciousness Network,

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.050 align:middle line:90%
and what that's about.

00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:21.660 align:middle line:84%
and also I have-- I
was thinking about it

00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:24.480 align:middle line:84%
and, any kind of correlations
to the Global Coherence Project

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:26.550 align:middle line:84%
and some of what's being
done with Heart Math,

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:28.540 align:middle line:84%
especially the earth
monitors and so forth?

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Kind of taking us
full circle back

00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:33.257 align:middle line:84%
to your original technology
work done on as a kid.

00:52:33.257 --> 00:52:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Yeah.

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:37.640 align:middle line:84%
So out of the PEAR lab was
born the Global Consciousness

00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Project, where Roger Nelson, who
is an experimental psychologist

00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:44.100 align:middle line:84%
working in the lab thought, what
if we took these random number

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:46.740 align:middle line:84%
generators and we spread
them around the world

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and we fed the data
into a central place?

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:52.140 align:middle line:90%
Are we going to see anything?

00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:54.590 align:middle line:84%
An idea which emerged probably
over a couple of beers,

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:56.410 align:middle line:90%
as the best ideas do.

00:52:56.410 --> 00:52:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And so he and Dean Radin
set about to do just that.

00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And to date there's about 70 of
these random number generators

00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:06.270 align:middle line:90%
which are feeding in data.

00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:09.170 align:middle line:90%
It's been around since 1998.

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And basically the
GCP said, OK, well,

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:15.140 align:middle line:84%
we're going to predefined
"large-scale world events"

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:16.770 align:middle line:84%
that polarize
people's attention,

00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:21.240 align:middle line:84%
things like sporting events
or natural disasters.

00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to look at the data

00:53:23.890 --> 00:53:25.360 align:middle line:84%
when these events
occur, and we're

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:27.430 align:middle line:84%
going to see if
there's any correlation

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:30.360 align:middle line:84%
between these disparate
random number generators.

00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And if so what's the
degree of correlation.

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And what they found is that
somehow these random number

00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:42.060 align:middle line:84%
generators actually do
become more coherent, sort

00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:44.630 align:middle line:84%
of less-random and more
coherent to each other

00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:47.420 align:middle line:84%
when these large-scale
events that polarize

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:49.522 align:middle line:90%
people's attention occur.

00:53:49.522 --> 00:53:50.730 align:middle line:90%
So that's really interesting.

00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:55.000 align:middle line:84%
That means that perhaps
either worldwide sort

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.750 align:middle line:84%
of focused consciousness
affects the entropy

00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:02.820 align:middle line:84%
of these random devices,
makes the world more coherent,

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:08.360 align:middle line:84%
or the people who know about
the GCP are somehow affecting

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:10.090 align:middle line:84%
the random number
generators in a way

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:12.400 align:middle line:84%
that they expect they'll
be affected because

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:13.760 align:middle line:90%
of these events.

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:15.630 align:middle line:84%
In any case, there
seems to be this--

00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:18.380 align:middle line:84%
there is this network of these
random number generators that

00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:24.940 align:middle line:84%
are very closely
relating-- they're showing

00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:27.470 align:middle line:84%
very close relationships
between the lack

00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:32.320 align:middle line:84%
of-- or between coherence and
of random data in world events.

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:36.670 align:middle line:84%
But that is a bit limited, in
the sense that you can't really

00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:40.290 align:middle line:84%
look more closely at the
behavior of what we might call

00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:42.620 align:middle line:84%
a global or a collective
consciousness with only 70

00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:44.190 align:middle line:90%
units spread around the world.

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:47.560 align:middle line:84%
So one of the ideas behind the
Consciousness app, my thing,

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:51.906 align:middle line:84%
is that by getting this into the
hands of hundreds of thousands,

00:54:51.906 --> 00:54:53.280 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even
millions of people,

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:55.080 align:middle line:84%
we'll have that many
more data points

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:57.320 align:middle line:84%
and we can start to look
in a more granular way

00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:01.170 align:middle line:84%
at the notion of a global
or collective consciousness,

00:55:01.170 --> 00:55:05.547 align:middle line:84%
and what it is and how it
works and how it behaves.

00:55:05.547 --> 00:55:07.130 align:middle line:84%
You asked if it was
predictive or not.

00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a question
that we can perhaps

00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:14.325 align:middle line:84%
begin to ascertain with
just more data points.

00:55:14.325 --> 00:55:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, is it-- I
don't know if qualitative

00:55:16.450 --> 00:55:18.460 align:middle line:84%
is the right word,
but once you start

00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:21.030 align:middle line:84%
seeing this coherence
happen, can you also

00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:23.280 align:middle line:84%
determine whether the
field has been impacted,

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:26.190 align:middle line:90%
say, negatively or positively?

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: I don't think so.

00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:28.845 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just
you can see coherence.

00:55:28.845 --> 00:55:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: Unfortunately, I don't
think that's the way it works.

00:55:29.810 --> 00:55:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's just a
coherence that's occurring.

00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:31.975 align:middle line:90%
>>CURRY: Right.

00:55:31.975 --> 00:55:32.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:34.229 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:55:34.229 --> 00:55:35.770 align:middle line:84%
People want to get
a hold of the app,

00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:37.267 align:middle line:84%
and how are they
going to start--

00:55:37.267 --> 00:55:39.350 align:middle line:84%
what's kind of necessary--
if you're going to say,

00:55:39.350 --> 00:55:40.890 align:middle line:84%
what's a basic
requirement if you're

00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:44.210 align:middle line:84%
a person that wants to become
involved with your app.

00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:48.917 align:middle line:10%
>>CURRY: Well, we have a website
and you can check it out.

00:55:48.917 --> 00:55:50.750 align:middle line:10%
You can look at the
people who are involved.

00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Many of the leading
consciousness researchers

00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:57.790 align:middle line:84%
are involved with this project,
from Dean Radin and IONS,

00:55:57.790 --> 00:55:59.950 align:middle line:84%
to the Global Consciousness
Project and PEAR,

00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:04.470 align:middle line:84%
and many leading Silicon
Valley technologists as well

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:05.141 align:middle line:90%
are involved.

00:56:05.141 --> 00:56:07.640 align:middle line:10%
So you can read more about it,
you can see what we're up to,

00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:09.181 align:middle line:10%
you can see previews
and screenshots.

00:56:09.181 --> 00:56:12.410 align:middle line:10%
And most importantly, you
can subscribe for updates.

00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:15.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to try this
out, just put in your email

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:18.710 align:middle line:84%
and when it's ready we'll
get in touch with you.

00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It sounds
absolutely fascinating.

00:56:21.310 --> 00:56:24.582 align:middle line:84%
And we have very little time
left, just a minute or so.

00:56:24.582 --> 00:56:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything else
you'd like to get across

00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:30.130 align:middle line:84%
that we have not covered in
this conversation regarding

00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:33.237 align:middle line:84%
the future of this world
through the potentials

00:56:33.237 --> 00:56:35.570 align:middle line:84%
of this kind of technology,
what your dream would be out

00:56:35.570 --> 00:56:38.290 align:middle line:90%
of all of this?

00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CURRY: Well,
for my small part,

00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:43.160 align:middle line:90%
I love building cool things.

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'm mostly looking forward
to building something that's

00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:48.980 align:middle line:84%
really cool, that has
some staying power.

00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And if this can be the first
example of a consciousness

00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:54.220 align:middle line:84%
technology, in addition
to providing people

00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:55.684 align:middle line:84%
with just endless
deep discussions

00:56:55.684 --> 00:56:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and hands-on experiences
of these things

00:56:57.350 --> 00:57:00.690 align:middle line:84%
that have previously been
relegated to books and talk

00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:05.020 align:middle line:84%
shows, then I'll
feel quite satisfied.

00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:09.420 align:middle line:84%
But in my own small part I
hope that this will perhaps

00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:14.100 align:middle line:84%
expedite this change of
the materialist metaphysic

00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:17.910 align:middle line:84%
into something that is more
consistent with reality,

00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:21.430 align:middle line:84%
a more integrated notion
of how the world works

00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:24.980 align:middle line:84%
that allows for
consciousness to-- it

00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:27.140 align:middle line:84%
gives it its rightful
place and just treats it

00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:28.470 align:middle line:90%
with a little more respect.

00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:30.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's about time.

00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:31.230 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Adam.

00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:33.220 align:middle line:90%
