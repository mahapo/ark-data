>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Bruce Goldberg

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.340 align:middle line:84%
has spent decades putting
people into a state of hypnosis

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.130 align:middle line:84%
for every reason
from the mundane,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.490 align:middle line:84%
such as weight loss
and common fears,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.930 align:middle line:84%
to the phenomenon known
as alien abductions,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.130 align:middle line:84%
the fifth dimension,
and progressing

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.070 align:middle line:90%
into the future of our species.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.800 align:middle line:10%
When exploring the
subconscious mind,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.950 align:middle line:10%
one never knows
what's going to show.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.830 align:middle line:10%
From his thousands
of case studies,

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.170 align:middle line:10%
he has seen what he feels is
a clear portrait of our future

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.780 align:middle line:10%
as a species here on Earth
and what may be playing out

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.760 align:middle line:10%
in parallel realities
or universes.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.910 align:middle line:84%
All of it is
immensely fascinating.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.194 align:middle line:90%
And he's with us here today.

00:00:49.194 --> 00:00:50.235 align:middle line:90%
It's so good to meet you.

00:00:50.235 --> 00:00:51.380 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
time we've met.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BRUCE GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.104 align:middle line:84%
It's a pleasure
to meet with you,

00:00:53.104 --> 00:00:55.356 align:middle line:84%
and looking forward to
educating the public

00:00:55.356 --> 00:00:56.730 align:middle line:84%
on a very fascinating
discipline.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, boy.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.000 align:middle line:84%
I hope you have very wide
boundaries, because we're

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.750 align:middle line:84%
going into some terrain
that most people never

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.560 align:middle line:90%
even consider.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: My boundaries
are wider than a Super Bowl

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.740 align:middle line:90%
stadium.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're right.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.650 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely right.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.555 align:middle line:84%
So I think first
of all, let's just

00:01:12.555 --> 00:01:14.100 align:middle line:90%
get into some of the basics.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.849 align:middle line:84%
And that is after
all of these years,

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:18.390 align:middle line:84%
just getting down
to the effect, what

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.710 align:middle line:84%
do you see as the
primary advantage

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.500 align:middle line:84%
in doing your work
in progression?

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And talk about your history
in doing progression therapy.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.884 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
not normally done.

00:01:27.884 --> 00:01:30.300 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, I started
off doing past life regression

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.100 align:middle line:10%
many years ago.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.870 align:middle line:10%
And then when I
asked a patient to go

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:10%
to the origin of a problem,
she went to the 23rd century.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.582 align:middle line:10%
And that was--
nobody else had ever

00:01:37.582 --> 00:01:40.040 align:middle line:10%
written a book on future life
progression and hypnotherapy.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.090 align:middle line:84%
My very first book, "Past
Lives, Future Lives,"

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.190 align:middle line:84%
was the first book
written in 1982.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So going into the
future gives them

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.510 align:middle line:84%
empowerment, what I call
psychic empowerment,

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.000 align:middle line:84%
because you can see the future,
and therefore future options.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And you can change the future,
and therefore help yourself.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.040 align:middle line:84%
The idea of doing all this,
of course, and everything

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.520 align:middle line:84%
I deal with is accessing your
higher self and spiritually

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.920 align:middle line:84%
evolving yourself, raising
the level of consciousness,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.050 align:middle line:84%
the quality of your subconscious
mind, to a higher level.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.240 align:middle line:84%
And that puts you on the
road towards ascension.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.080 align:middle line:84%
So that's really the big bottom
line to this whole field.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
certainly are an example

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.840 align:middle line:90%
of that which you speak of.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.327 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen anyone with
such an incredibly quick mind.

00:02:20.327 --> 00:02:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And I asked you off camera, do
you have a photographic memory?

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.340 align:middle line:90%
And you said no.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.650 align:middle line:84%
But you're absolutely
present, and so you remember.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And most people do
not use their mind.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.070 align:middle line:84%
The vast majority of the
time we are slipping off

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.020 align:middle line:84%
into alpha states and
other states of dreaminess

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.564 align:middle line:84%
and really missing what's
going on in the moment.

00:02:39.564 --> 00:02:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: This is the
advantage of hypnosis.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.007 align:middle line:90%
All hypnosis is self-hypnosis.

00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:44.840 align:middle line:84%
A natural daydream,
driving on the freeway--

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG:
--watching TV, playing

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.494 align:middle line:84%
with your computer, baking
cookies, whatever you're

00:02:48.494 --> 00:02:50.550 align:middle line:84%
doing that focuses
time, allows time

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.910 align:middle line:84%
to go by quickly without
you realizing it,

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:53.910 align:middle line:90%
and you're relaxed.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a natural
example of a daydream,

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.110 align:middle line:90%
which really is hypnosis.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.100 align:middle line:84%
It's an alpha brain
wave medically.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.035 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the
characteristics of hypnosis

00:03:01.035 --> 00:03:02.197 align:middle line:90%
is focus concentration.

00:03:02.197 --> 00:03:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So the
more people can focus--

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.060 align:middle line:84%
and the problem most
people have today

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.720 align:middle line:90%
is that they're too distracted.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they
don't pay attention.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they look like
the absent minded professor.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.172 align:middle line:90%
They just can't remember things.

00:03:14.172 --> 00:03:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, one thing, I want to talk
about the future, just about

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.560 align:middle line:90%
age progression.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.050 align:middle line:90%
I want to separate some terms.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Going into the
future lives is what

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.760 align:middle line:84%
I call future life progression,
your next lifetime or beyond.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.617 align:middle line:84%
But age progression is
relevant to this current life.

00:03:26.617 --> 00:03:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Back in 1996, I
worked with a young college

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.290 align:middle line:90%
graduate.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.080 align:middle line:90%
It was June.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And she came to Los
Angeles from New York City.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.930 align:middle line:84%
She wanted to work with me
on out of body experiences.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.015 align:middle line:90%
And I said fine.

00:03:38.015 --> 00:03:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you go
out of the body,

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.806 align:middle line:84%
you're in the
spacetime continuum.

00:03:40.806 --> 00:03:42.300 align:middle line:90%
You can perceive future events.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.160 align:middle line:84%
So while she was in my office
in Los Angeles for that week,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.970 align:middle line:84%
she was able to
see future events

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.340 align:middle line:84%
that week that was going to
occur in LA, which did occur.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.950 align:middle line:84%
So she had a very
good track record.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:52.882 align:middle line:90%
She goes home.

00:03:52.882 --> 00:03:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Three weeks later,
she calls me up.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, I'm going
to Europe next week.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.975 align:middle line:90%
And I used your techniques.

00:03:56.975 --> 00:03:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to see how
my Paris trip would be.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.420 align:middle line:90%
And I saw myself.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.880 align:middle line:84%
The plane takes off JFK,
immediately crashes.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:90%
I die.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.070 align:middle line:90%
Everybody dies.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.190 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.830 align:middle line:84%
I call her Tammy--
not her real name.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.595 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Tammy, I don't
want to change your life

00:04:09.595 --> 00:04:10.470 align:middle line:90%
or control your life.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Just change your flight
plans, and give me

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.430 align:middle line:90%
a call at the end of the summer.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.980 align:middle line:90%
She did.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And she told me something
very fascinating.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.010 align:middle line:84%
She was going to go on TWA
Flight 800 July 17, 1996.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.500 align:middle line:84%
230 people all died, all
crew, all passengers.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.450 align:middle line:84%
The plane took off
JFK, immediately

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.290 align:middle line:90%
crashed just like she perceived.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.580 align:middle line:84%
So Tammy, by seeing
into the future,

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.930 align:middle line:84%
not only is it not dangerous,
but she saved her life.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And remember, everybody
out there, every viewer,

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.510 align:middle line:84%
goes through hypnosis
for seven hours a day.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.550 align:middle line:84%
Four hours during the week,
broken up into bits and pieces.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Three hours during
their dream levels

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.320 align:middle line:84%
at night, which is what
we call the REM cycle.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Without it, we would die of
a heart attack or a stroke.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.464 align:middle line:90%
We would die of stress issues.

00:04:50.464 --> 00:04:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So hypnosis is
not dangerous, it's natural.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.677 align:middle line:84%
However, what I'm doing
with it is train them

00:04:55.677 --> 00:04:56.885 align:middle line:90%
for a different application--

00:04:56.885 --> 00:04:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yup.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.746 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --that
won't interfere

00:04:58.746 --> 00:05:00.860 align:middle line:84%
with the life preservation
processes, but allows

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.900 align:middle line:84%
them to empower
themselves in their lives.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
you don't seem to me

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.706 align:middle line:84%
to be a person that
spends a lot of time

00:05:05.706 --> 00:05:07.945 align:middle line:84%
in the alpha state
in the daytime.

00:05:07.945 --> 00:05:08.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: No, I do.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You seem to
be so actively engaged.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: I'm very active.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.600 align:middle line:84%
But you can be active
and be in alpha.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.610 align:middle line:90%
I can be playing tennis.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.709 align:middle line:90%
Or I can be--

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:16.875 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And still have
that relaxed state of mind.

00:05:16.875 --> 00:05:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, yes.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.787 align:middle line:84%
I've done alpha techniques
when I've been on interviews.

00:05:19.787 --> 00:05:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.270 align:middle line:84%
I was telling you off
camera that one time I

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.190 align:middle line:84%
did a media tour for
one of my publishers,

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.481 align:middle line:90%
including speaking engagements.

00:05:26.481 --> 00:05:27.960 align:middle line:90%
And I had no sleep for two days.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.750 align:middle line:84%
I was in alpha for about an hour
at a time taking a little rest.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:32.540 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a sleep.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.430 align:middle line:84%
It was a super conscious
mind tap, as I call it.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.030 align:middle line:90%
And basically, it recharged me.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.200 align:middle line:84%
I was awake for
two straight days

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.790 align:middle line:84%
and functioning well
on media interviews,

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.786 align:middle line:84%
on speaking engagements, on
private sessions, et cetera.

00:05:44.786 --> 00:05:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So anyone can do it
if they're trained.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, you've
learned to master

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.190 align:middle line:84%
your states of
consciousness very well.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And the whole subject
of progression

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.880 align:middle line:84%
becomes interesting when
we start dovetailing it

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.570 align:middle line:84%
with the notion of
alien abductions.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a subject we
might as well launch into.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.570 align:middle line:84%
It has a tarnished
reputation at best

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.620 align:middle line:84%
because the skeptic
societies and other groups

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:84%
have made sure that people
put a very large giggle

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.140 align:middle line:90%
factor around it.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have dealt
with this quite a lot.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And you also knew the
late Dr. John Mack,

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.200 align:middle line:84%
who is a gentleman and
scholar at Harvard,

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.450 align:middle line:84%
who embraced this
subject as well.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And I want to get into
some of the nature of it.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And although it's not
a common experience

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.400 align:middle line:84%
for the average
person, I think it's

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.230 align:middle line:84%
important to know
because it is giving us

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.540 align:middle line:84%
glimpses into our potential as
a species and into our future.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.015 align:middle line:90%
So if we start diving into it--

00:06:35.015 --> 00:06:35.640 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.598 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --give us an
idea of your background.

00:06:37.598 --> 00:06:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: First, let's
separate abductions.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.040 align:middle line:84%
We have to deal with
some hard facts first.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Current estimates are there's at
least 7 to 8 million Americans

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.890 align:middle line:90%
that have been abducted.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.310 align:middle line:84%
In 1987 the American
Psychological Association,

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.790 align:middle line:84%
at their annual meeting,
presented research

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.040 align:middle line:84%
on the psychological
profile of abductees.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And you know what
they found out?

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.340 align:middle line:84%
They were nice, average
neurotic Americans no different

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.460 align:middle line:90%
than anybody else.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.610 align:middle line:84%
They're not psychotic,
not schizophrenic.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, abductions
are not just weird people--

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.686 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:06.686 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --who
look for attention.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.880 align:middle line:90%
There's two kinds of abductions.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.830 align:middle line:10%
One is that there are
abductions from ETs,

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.500 align:middle line:10%
the Greys that we mostly see.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.250 align:middle line:10%
The Zeta Reticulis or what
I call the Steven Spielberg

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.770 align:middle line:10%
aliens, OK?

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.846 align:middle line:10%
They represent the
current century.

00:07:20.846 --> 00:07:21.970 align:middle line:10%
They're not time travelers.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.714 align:middle line:10%
They are from the
current century.

00:07:23.714 --> 00:07:25.255 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, are
you saying they're

00:07:25.255 --> 00:07:27.480 align:middle line:84%
from this time frame
or just this century?

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They're
from this time.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So they're from now.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, they
could be from the past, too.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.490 align:middle line:84%
But I mean, the ones
that are here now--

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --they've been doing
this for hundreds of thousands

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:33.670 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:34.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, you just
introduced the notion

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.730 align:middle line:84%
of time travel, which we
will get into in a bit.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:36.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: We'll get there.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's separate--
so in other words,

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.080 align:middle line:84%
a Zeta Reticuli from
the 21st century

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.052 align:middle line:84%
is now going to abduct someone
for sperm and egg samples.

00:07:45.052 --> 00:07:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
take them on a craft

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.992 align:middle line:90%
or a military installation.

00:07:47.992 --> 00:07:50.200 align:middle line:84%
There's your conspiracy
aspect with the governments--

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.540 align:middle line:84%
of all countries, by
the way, not just us.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's one thing.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of those
are not so cool

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.880 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
really care about us.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.790 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
their own survival,

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.160 align:middle line:84%
because the Greys have a
lot of fertility problems.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.535 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing
research on us,

00:08:03.535 --> 00:08:06.710 align:middle line:84%
just like we would do
research on lower animals.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.160 align:middle line:84%
There isn't a lot of spiritual
growth with the current century

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:10.860 align:middle line:90%
ETs.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.117 align:middle line:84%
However, there are about
15% of the abductions from

00:08:14.117 --> 00:08:16.450 align:middle line:84%
my research-- and I've been
doing this for a long time--

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:17.444 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:17.444 --> 00:08:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --are actually
time travelers from our future.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:90%
I call them Chrononauts.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And the Chrononauts have four
different representatives.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.030 align:middle line:84%
In my book, just
for the viewers,

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.850 align:middle line:84%
this is "Time Travelers
From Our Future."

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is such
a fascinating book.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.966 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I detail this in--

00:08:30.966 --> 00:08:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.698 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But basically,
what you have is you

00:08:33.698 --> 00:08:36.169 align:middle line:84%
have the Greys, which are
3 to 5 feet tall, no ear

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:38.761 align:middle line:84%
lobes, no hair, four
fingers and toes.

00:08:38.761 --> 00:08:39.969 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tiny little mouths.

00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:41.539 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Big almond eyes, OK?

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:42.049 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:45.177 align:middle line:84%
And they wear jumpsuits,
one-piece jumpsuits,

00:08:45.177 --> 00:08:46.260 align:middle line:90%
and it's very significant.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.270 align:middle line:84%
They always have a
triangular design

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.850 align:middle line:90%
if they're from the future.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.950 align:middle line:84%
If you see a futuristic person,
and they're driving a craft

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.884 align:middle line:84%
or they have an insignia
on their uniform,

00:08:55.884 --> 00:08:57.050 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be a triangle.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.010 align:middle line:84%
That's very significant
for the future.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.060 align:middle line:84%
That's how you tell the
difference, one of them.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.294 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, those are the Greys.

00:09:01.294 --> 00:09:02.710 align:middle line:84%
They are sort of
like the gophers.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.360 align:middle line:84%
They're the lowest level
of a time traveler team.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.050 align:middle line:90%
The next one is the hybrids.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.350 align:middle line:84%
These are men about 5
to 6 feet tall, whitish

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.310 align:middle line:84%
to bronzish skin tones
for the facial tone.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.500 align:middle line:90%
They look pretty human.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.190 align:middle line:84%
But they have these faceted
eyes and these odd foreheads.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.210 align:middle line:84%
So the closer you
get to a hybrid,

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:23.240 align:middle line:84%
the more you realize you're
not in Kansas anymore.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the pure human,
who is the leader of the team.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.428 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before you
go there, the hybrid

00:09:27.428 --> 00:09:30.429 align:middle line:84%
is hybridized between an ET
species and a human species

00:09:30.429 --> 00:09:31.095 align:middle line:90%
from the future?

00:09:31.095 --> 00:09:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:31.630 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.760 align:middle line:90%
That's correct, from the future.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.816 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You might say
the Grey ones-- you know,

00:09:34.816 --> 00:09:36.324 align:middle line:84%
people think the
Greys are aliens.

00:09:36.324 --> 00:09:37.240 align:middle line:90%
Actually, they're not.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.170 align:middle line:84%
They've been on this planet
for hundreds of years.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.961 align:middle line:84%
So you might say they
have their Grey card.

00:09:40.961 --> 00:09:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now, the
pure human time traveler,

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:44.621 align:middle line:90%
they're the leader.

00:09:44.621 --> 00:09:47.989 align:middle line:84%
They're 6 to 7 feet tall, blond,
blue-eyed, Caucasian mostly.

00:09:47.989 --> 00:09:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they kill
the other races.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.730 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have
mostly Caucasians.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:56.010 align:middle line:84%
They always wear a white robe
sometimes with a nice sash.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:56.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.050 align:middle line:90%
They communicate by telepathy.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.090 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in a military
base, or if you're

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.800 align:middle line:84%
in a craft with a
time traveler team,

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.147 align:middle line:84%
the communication will
almost always be telepathic.

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:07.605 align:middle line:84%
Those are the three
major-- usually

00:10:07.605 --> 00:10:10.610 align:middle line:84%
have two Greys, a
hybrid, and a Caucasian,

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.237 align:middle line:84%
or the pure human time traveler
will be your normal team.

00:10:14.237 --> 00:10:16.070 align:middle line:84%
These are in the early
phases of time travel

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.740 align:middle line:84%
from the 31st to
the 34th century.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Time travel will be
established in the year 3,050,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.770 align:middle line:84%
give or take a few years,
by a man named Taatos.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:25.270 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And his first team, we
call them Chrononauts,

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:33.170 align:middle line:84%
was Geb, Osiris, Isis,
and Taatos, and Horace.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.743 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we are going to
do an entirely separate show

00:10:35.743 --> 00:10:35.940 align:middle line:90%
on that.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:36.564 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:10:36.564 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:90%
So we understand.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:38.900 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason why
we have the past that

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.040 align:middle line:90%
is really related to the future.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.045 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:10:41.045 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle line:84%
So now, there is a fourth
kind of time traveler

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.670 align:middle line:84%
that is, you might
say, a criminal

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.542 align:middle line:84%
coming in from the future
who is escaping the cops.

00:10:49.542 --> 00:10:50.750 align:middle line:90%
And those are the Reptilians.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.040 align:middle line:10%
Reptilians are always negative.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.300 align:middle line:10%
They're about 6 to 8 feet
tall, 250 pounds give or take.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.240 align:middle line:10%
Their skin colors range from
green to gray to blue to brown.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.760 align:middle line:10%
They don't have wings, like the
ones in the current century.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Those are the Drakos from
the Drako constellation.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.260 align:middle line:84%
The ones in the
future have no wings.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.130 align:middle line:90%
But they also can shapeshift.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they
wear human-like skins

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.220 align:middle line:84%
they can peel off to show
their reptilian persona.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:90%
They're evil.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.550 align:middle line:90%
They're nasty.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:18.556 align:middle line:90%
They're cannibalistic.

00:11:18.556 --> 00:11:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And they're not here
because they're invited.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.100 align:middle line:84%
They're here because
they're escaping

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.686 align:middle line:84%
from the authorities
of the future.

00:11:23.686 --> 00:11:25.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: This is
interesting because, of course,

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.330 align:middle line:84%
well, most of us are familiar
with David Icke's work.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And he has taken such a
beating through the last couple

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.830 align:middle line:84%
of decades as a result of
openly identifying them.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And he has dealt
with some people

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.980 align:middle line:84%
who say, just as
you're talking about,

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.040 align:middle line:84%
that they have seen them
shift from human personage

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.930 align:middle line:84%
into their reptilian
personage underneath that.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.122 align:middle line:84%
And talk about giggle
factors, I don't

00:11:49.122 --> 00:11:51.080 align:middle line:84%
think anyone's been
laughed at more than David.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.280 align:middle line:10%
But you're saying that
you have experienced this

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.310 align:middle line:10%
through the
regressions you've done

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.720 align:middle line:10%
and the progressions
you've done repeatedly,

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.710 align:middle line:10%
that these characters
have been here,

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:04.640 align:middle line:10%
and essentially causing damage
to society for how long?

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, for literally
hundreds of thousands,

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.800 align:middle line:90%
if not millions of years.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.680 align:middle line:10%
Now, one thing we
should understand

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.340 align:middle line:10%
about the reptilians,
the reason why

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.460 align:middle line:10%
you don't hear many reports
about reptilians, most

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.234 align:middle line:10%
of the reports are from
Greys or the Pleiadians.

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:17.025 align:middle line:10%
You'll hear reports
about the Nordic types,

00:12:17.025 --> 00:12:17.775 align:middle line:10%
as they call them.

00:12:17.775 --> 00:12:18.880 align:middle line:90%
Those are the Pleiadians.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they say what?

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: You'll hear reports.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.500 align:middle line:90%
People report contact with them.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.159 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:24.950 align:middle line:84%
But you don't here many
Reptilian contacts,

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.270 align:middle line:90%
because they're cannibalistics.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.960 align:middle line:84%
So they tend to
eat their mistakes.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So
that's why they're

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.290 align:middle line:90%
very rare in the reports.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.790 align:middle line:84%
By the way, it's
not just a question

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.290 align:middle line:84%
of regressions and progressions,
in this case, progressions.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.899 align:middle line:84%
People can also be trained to
go into the fifth dimension--

00:12:38.899 --> 00:12:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.740 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was
going to ask you next.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --and
contact them themselves.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, the
Reptilians, it seems to me,

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:45.190 align:middle line:84%
would have a very good reason
for staying under the radar.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.430 align:middle line:90%
They do not want us--

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: -- to be aware
of what they're up to.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:49.025 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Of couse.

00:12:49.025 --> 00:12:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So of course they
would be deliberately trying

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:53.904 align:middle line:90%
to escape any kind of detection.

00:12:53.904 --> 00:12:54.820 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Of course.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.675 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, I want to
get back to Zeta Reticulans.

00:12:57.675 --> 00:12:59.800 align:middle line:84%
I want to get back to the
Pleiadians and all of it.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: By the way,
the Zeta Reticulis also

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:84%
don't want to be detected,
because the Men in Black

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:03.140 align:middle line:90%
would take them out.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.929 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:03.929 --> 00:13:05.300 align:middle line:90%
So we'll get back to them.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, just sticking with
the Reptilian and let's

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.776 align:middle line:84%
talk about what
you just broached,

00:13:08.776 --> 00:13:10.350 align:middle line:84%
the subject of the
fifth dimension.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.990 align:middle line:84%
There's this misperception
people have that

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.610 align:middle line:84%
because something belongs
to a particular dimensional

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:19.120 align:middle line:84%
frequency, if it's higher
than the third or the fourth,

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.850 align:middle line:90%
that it's automatically good.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:21.800 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a frequency range, right?

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:24.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, it's
a frequency range.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.340 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly,
it's a dimensional range.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.471 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The best way
to look upon it is this.

00:13:28.471 --> 00:13:30.790 align:middle line:10%
Now, in the "Exploring
the Fifth Dimension" book,

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.890 align:middle line:10%
I talk about how people
can actually be trained.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:34.431 align:middle line:10%
And if they go to
my website, there's

00:13:34.431 --> 00:13:36.670 align:middle line:10%
an exercise called fifth
dimensional traveling.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:37.500 align:middle line:10%
You can go there.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.160 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes, it's very clear.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.450 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: When you go
into the fifth dimension,

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:40.960 align:middle line:10%
you can see the time travelers.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.110 align:middle line:84%
They come back in time
through the fifth dimension.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:45.350 align:middle line:84%
I'll explain the
mechanics of that.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And they do that,
because when they're

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.290 align:middle line:84%
doing that you can't see a
fifth dimensional being--

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:49.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --unless they come
down to the third dimension.

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have three dimensions,
length, width, and breadth,

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:54.971 align:middle line:90%
depth, OK?

00:13:54.971 --> 00:13:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Arguably,
even fourth now.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, the
fourth dimension is time.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.416 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
physicists use for

00:13:59.416 --> 00:14:00.940 align:middle line:90%
their mathematical equations.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And then anything beyond
the fourth dimension,

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.020 align:middle line:84%
such as the astral plane, mental
plane, all these dimensions,

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.470 align:middle line:84%
or parallel universes,
which we'll get into, too,

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.940 align:middle line:84%
those represent the
fifth dimension.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're traveling in
the fifth dimension, which

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.952 align:middle line:84%
time travelers will
do, they're invisible.

00:14:15.952 --> 00:14:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Because when they come
down to the Earth,

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.285 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
see a time traveler

00:14:19.285 --> 00:14:21.379 align:middle line:84%
go on CNN or in the
UN giving a talk.

00:14:21.379 --> 00:14:23.920 align:middle line:84%
If they do, the Men in Black,
the governments will kill them.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Because
the government does not

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.730 align:middle line:84%
want you to know about
ETs or time travelers.

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.900 align:middle line:84%
They're very, very
paranoid about this,

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.200 align:middle line:84%
all the governments,
not just our government.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, that's true.

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:33.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So
therefore, they're

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.720 align:middle line:90%
all going to be under the radar.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, if people want to
communicate with a time

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.770 align:middle line:84%
traveler or get verification
of my work, all they have to do

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.890 align:middle line:84%
is travel into the fifth
dimension where it's safe.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.390 align:middle line:84%
If they go into the
fifth dimension,

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:47.265 align:middle line:84%
go out of their body, which is
perfectly safe-- one example,

00:14:47.265 --> 00:14:49.640 align:middle line:84%
when you go to sleep at night,
you dream for three hours.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.080 align:middle line:84%
It's called a REM cycle,
alpha brain wave medically.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.552 align:middle line:84%
That's an out-of-body
experience.

00:14:53.552 --> 00:14:55.260 align:middle line:84%
That's been demonstrated
by universities,

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.310 align:middle line:84%
UCLA among others as an
out-of-body experience.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you do this
correctly, you can actually

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.890 align:middle line:84%
go to the areas in
the fifth dimension

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:03.879 align:middle line:84%
where you can meet
up with-- who can you

00:15:03.879 --> 00:15:05.170 align:middle line:90%
meet up in the fifth dimension?

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Time travelers, spirit guides,
angels, your higher self,

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.000 align:middle line:90%
departed loved ones, OK?

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.150 align:middle line:84%
You can meet up with fellow
astral voyagers as I call them.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.437 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want to go
to the lower astral plane.

00:15:17.437 --> 00:15:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: This is the
answer to your question.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.090 align:middle line:84%
The only dimension out
there that's negative--

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.643 align:middle line:84%
there's only two dimensions--
in my 13 dimension paradigm,

00:15:23.643 --> 00:15:25.810 align:middle line:84%
there's only two
that are negative.

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:28.730 align:middle line:84%
The lower astral plane, which
is like psychic attackers,

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:31.469 align:middle line:84%
the shadow people, people like
that that you've heard about,

00:15:31.469 --> 00:15:33.260 align:middle line:84%
and this dimension has
a lot of negativity.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.850 align:middle line:84%
All the other
dimensions are positive.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.170 align:middle line:84%
If you go to the
upper astral, you

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:37.461 align:middle line:90%
can work with your higher self.

00:15:37.461 --> 00:15:39.960 align:middle line:84%
The causal, mental,
etheric, soul plane-- those

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.720 align:middle line:90%
are all positive.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.430 align:middle line:90%
You can have a really good trip.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you go to the
lower astral, where people

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.770 align:middle line:84%
tend to do mostly, the reason
being is because-- very

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:50.187 align:middle line:84%
quickly, if they leave through
the first, second, or third

00:15:50.187 --> 00:15:51.769 align:middle line:84%
chakra when they go
to sleep at night,

00:15:51.769 --> 00:15:52.930 align:middle line:90%
the soul leaves the body.

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, it
leaves a clone of itself,

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:55.494 align:middle line:90%
so you're always protected.

00:15:55.494 --> 00:15:57.470 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
be possessed at night.

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:59.261 align:middle line:84%
Most people leave
through the third chakra,

00:15:59.261 --> 00:16:00.770 align:middle line:84%
the solar plexus,
the belly button.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.269 align:middle line:84%
And if they do that,
they have to go

00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:03.440 align:middle line:90%
to the lower astral plane.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.220 align:middle line:84%
If you leave through the heart,
the throat, the third eye,

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:07.840 align:middle line:84%
or the crown,
preferably the crown,

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.030 align:middle line:84%
you can only go to the upper
astral plane or beyond.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.640 align:middle line:84%
So I train people
to go through what

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.840 align:middle line:84%
we call the higher
chakras, not the lower.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.594 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They go
to the upper astral

00:16:17.594 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:84%
or they can go to
the causal, where

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:20.899 align:middle line:84%
they can read their
Akashic records.

00:16:20.899 --> 00:16:22.190 align:middle line:90%
Or they go to the mental plate.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.940 align:middle line:84%
They can meet religious
leaders, and they

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.859 align:middle line:84%
can see the blue highways
of the mental plane.

00:16:26.859 --> 00:16:28.400 align:middle line:84%
You know you're on
the mental planes,

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.300 align:middle line:84%
because all the roads are
blue, iridescent blue.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.675 align:middle line:84%
Go to the etheric plane, where
you can have etheric plane

00:16:32.675 --> 00:16:34.850 align:middle line:84%
surgery and actually
cure medical problems.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:36.766 align:middle line:84%
And then the soul plane,
where you reincarnate

00:16:36.766 --> 00:16:38.220 align:middle line:90%
and you choose your next life.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.760 align:middle line:84%
These dimensions
are all positive.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're all
these subtle aspects

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:42.950 align:middle line:90%
of our multi-dimensional self.

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But they're also
there for our spiritual growth.

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:45.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Because here's the
thing about it.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.710 align:middle line:84%
When a person clinically
dies, they cross into spirit.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:50.530 align:middle line:84%
The reincarnation
cycle is actually

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.690 align:middle line:84%
very detailed and
very well-known.

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:54.910 align:middle line:84%
What happens is it's an
out-of-body experience.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:84%
They're going from
the physical plane.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.952 align:middle line:84%
And because people die in
fear, thanks to society

00:16:58.952 --> 00:17:00.410 align:middle line:84%
and they're own
prejudices, they're

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:02.300 align:middle line:84%
going to go to the lower
astral for a while.

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.660 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
hang out for a while.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And then they're going
to enter the white light

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.380 align:middle line:84%
and go to the upper astral
where the higher self is now

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.369 align:middle line:90%
going to help them.

00:17:09.369 --> 00:17:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And then they're
eventually going

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:11.364 align:middle line:90%
to wind up in the soul plane.

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're going to
reevaluate their life

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.140 align:middle line:90%
and choose their next life.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.569 align:middle line:84%
So going out of the
body in these dimensions

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:17.631 align:middle line:90%
is a natural process.

00:17:17.631 --> 00:17:18.589 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:20.550 align:middle line:84%
We're doing it every day, every
night when we fall asleep.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:21.500 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, you don't
die every day hopefully.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:22.290 align:middle line:90%
We don't die.

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.180 align:middle line:84%
But I mean in terms
of leaving the body.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Every night we're
doing this as we sleep.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right.

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:26.885 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of
it is to recharge

00:17:26.885 --> 00:17:27.819 align:middle line:90%
our spiritual energies.

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Not just the
physical body with the enzymes

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and hormones
replacing the cells,

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.000 align:middle line:84%
it's also to recharge the
cosmic radiation, et cetera,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.799 align:middle line:84%
of our spiritual, of
our soul's energy.

00:17:36.799 --> 00:17:37.840 align:middle line:90%
Because what is the soul?

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.850 align:middle line:90%
By the way, this is science.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:39.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm a scientist.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:41.110 align:middle line:84%
I've got three degrees
in the sciences.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:43.400 align:middle line:84%
The soul is
electromagnetic radiation.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it can
influence living things.

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:47.720 align:middle line:84%
William Tiller, the
Professor Emeritus

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.290 align:middle line:84%
at Stanford
University, has shown

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.270 align:middle line:84%
in his research in
his recent books

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.370 align:middle line:84%
that the mind, the
subconscious mind,

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.105 align:middle line:84%
can influence fly larvae,
bacteria growth, et cetera.

00:17:56.105 --> 00:17:56.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.146 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And there's a
very interesting physicist

00:17:59.146 --> 00:18:02.020 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Eugene
Wigner, Nobel Prize Laureate.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.360 align:middle line:90%
This guy's no dummy.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And he states very simply
that if the mind is affected

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.730 align:middle line:84%
by the universe but cannot, in
itself, affect the universe,

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.120 align:middle line:84%
as in fifth dimensional
travel, teleportation,

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.540 align:middle line:84%
parallel universe exploration,
that would be the only example

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.070 align:middle line:84%
on this planet of a
one-way interaction,

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.830 align:middle line:84%
which physicists
says is impossible.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:25.060 align:middle line:84%
There are always at least
two directional interactions.

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.487 align:middle line:84%
So here's a Nobel Prize
Laureate to tell you that.

00:18:27.487 --> 00:18:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: By the
way, one last thing

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:30.429 align:middle line:84%
about Eugene Wigner
before you leave him.

00:18:30.429 --> 00:18:32.220 align:middle line:84%
He also, through the
use of quantum physics

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.790 align:middle line:84%
and mathematical
equations, has demonstrated

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:37.200 align:middle line:84%
that the universe does
have a perfect form

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.980 align:middle line:90%
of universal consciousness.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:90%
You can call that God.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.279 align:middle line:84%
So quantum physics supports
the monotheistic aspect.

00:18:44.279 --> 00:18:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Bernard Haisch.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:45.340 align:middle line:90%
God Theory.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are a lot of
quantum physicists now--

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Sure.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --who are
jumping on board

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.840 align:middle line:84%
and finding their own way
to articulate that subject

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.174 align:middle line:84%
through their own various
experimentations and so forth.

00:18:54.174 --> 00:18:56.506 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The key issue
here is folks don't be afraid.

00:18:56.506 --> 00:18:57.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Audience, do not be
afraid to go out of the body.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.420 align:middle line:90%
It's natural.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.740 align:middle line:84%
What you want to
do is control it.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.531 align:middle line:84%
And you want to use it
for your own growth.

00:19:02.531 --> 00:19:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Because most people, if they
go to the lower astral plane,

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.035 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have
Darth Vader harassing them

00:19:07.035 --> 00:19:07.560 align:middle line:90%
for three hours.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:07.885 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:19:07.885 --> 00:19:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And they're not going to
want to do that one again.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:10.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, that's why
people wake up with nightmares.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: We have what
we call terrormares.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Kids have it.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.020 align:middle line:90%
But adults have it, too.

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:14.370 align:middle line:90%
They wake up.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:15.670 align:middle line:84%
It's like, oh, I don't
want to go back to sleep.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: This monster
was attacking me.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:17.691 align:middle line:90%
They're sweating.

00:19:17.691 --> 00:19:19.065 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, what
they did was they

00:19:19.065 --> 00:19:20.120 align:middle line:90%
were on the lower astral plane.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
isn't that really,

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.690 align:middle line:84%
if you were looking at it as an
allegory, what hell would be--

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, no
that's-- actually--

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.239 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --ending up
in the lower astral?

00:19:27.239 --> 00:19:29.487 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Actually,
hell was actually-- well,

00:19:29.487 --> 00:19:31.320 align:middle line:84%
we talk about this with
the Egypt situation.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Hell was invented by the
Egyptian Mystery School priests

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.270 align:middle line:84%
in 3100 BC when they unified
Egypt to control the masses,

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:39.297 align:middle line:84%
because they have 500
gods in Northern Egypt

00:19:39.297 --> 00:19:40.630 align:middle line:90%
and of 500 gods in the Southern.

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But basically,
if you go to the lower astral

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.080 align:middle line:84%
plane, you would think
that you were in Hell.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:45.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
what I'm saying.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.600 align:middle line:84%
I think that's functionally--
that plane is functionally

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.320 align:middle line:84%
what people are
coming back with.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But the difference
is you can get out of it.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:51.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.255 align:middle line:90%
You're not there forever.

00:19:52.255 --> 00:19:52.586 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You can't
get out of hell,

00:19:52.586 --> 00:19:54.130 align:middle line:84%
but you get out of
the lower astral.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:54.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you for
setting all that up.

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:58.110 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to get back into
the experience people are having

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.795 align:middle line:84%
with these various
types of entities--

00:20:03.795 --> 00:20:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:06.303 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --so we can
kind of get a portrait

00:20:06.303 --> 00:20:09.427 align:middle line:84%
from the lowest, which are
the Reptilian, to the highest

00:20:09.427 --> 00:20:10.510 align:middle line:90%
experience they're having.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get into a
couple of case studies as well.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:13.485 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:20:13.485 --> 00:20:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So as far as wrapping
up the Reptilian issue,

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.570 align:middle line:84%
with people that have gone
into contact with them,

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.654 align:middle line:84%
what is the experience
they've had?

00:20:22.654 --> 00:20:24.320 align:middle line:84%
What are they bringing
back in fullness?

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Not a very good one.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:26.660 align:middle line:84%
First of all, most of
them don't survive.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.090 align:middle line:10%
And the ones that do survive--
you have to understand,

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:31.382 align:middle line:10%
Reptilians are cousins
of the Zeta Reticuli.

00:20:31.382 --> 00:20:32.590 align:middle line:10%
They are related genetically.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:33.923 align:middle line:10%
Actually, so are the Pleiadians.

00:20:33.923 --> 00:20:36.410 align:middle line:10%
Interesting, but that's a whole
different positive mindset

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:37.670 align:middle line:10%
to them.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:39.490 align:middle line:10%
The Reptilian contact
is never good.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:39.990 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:41.440 align:middle line:90%
These are negative entities.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.469 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
manipulate, control.

00:20:43.469 --> 00:20:45.260 align:middle line:84%
They are not here for
your spiritual growth

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.490 align:middle line:84%
under any circumstance
even in the future.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.800 align:middle line:84%
They're not members of
any time travel team.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So if anybody has a
contact with a Reptilian,

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.875 align:middle line:84%
you want to do a Dionne
Warwick and walk on by.

00:20:54.875 --> 00:20:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Get out of there
as quickly as possible.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't engage.

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:58.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Don't engage
even though they may try--

00:20:58.150 --> 00:20:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't become fearful.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.614 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, they
can try to play games.

00:21:00.614 --> 00:21:01.870 align:middle line:90%
They can try to schmooze.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:02.630 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:03.850 align:middle line:90%
Just keep away from them.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.630 align:middle line:84%
If you confront them, they
won't do anything really crazy

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:07.600 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
want to be known.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.183 align:middle line:84%
Remember, they're
going to be obvious.

00:21:09.183 --> 00:21:12.590 align:middle line:84%
If there's a Reptilian on
the 14th Street highway,

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:14.215 align:middle line:84%
they're kind of hard
to hide, you know?

00:21:14.215 --> 00:21:14.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Then
again, some of them

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:16.791 align:middle line:84%
shape shift and have
human-like skin,

00:21:16.791 --> 00:21:18.020 align:middle line:90%
so they can try to blend in.

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they
have these eyes.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The
vertical pupils, yes.

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And the
lizard-like skin don't forget.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The lizard-like
skin is also another thing.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult when
you go against our skin

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.244 align:middle line:90%
to a lizard-like skin.

00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:28.160 align:middle line:90%
So you can touch them.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.370 align:middle line:84%
You can realize that
something's wrong.

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, but best not to.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Best not to.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't pet them.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Keep away.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't pet them.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.613 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Don't pet them, yes.

00:21:35.613 --> 00:21:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Don't feed them
any fruit either.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.490 align:middle line:84%
So the Reptilians are
just like, move on there.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, as far as case
histories, time travelers

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.310 align:middle line:90%
are very interesting.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:45.893 align:middle line:84%
Remember these are
called Chrononauts.

00:21:45.893 --> 00:21:47.700 align:middle line:90%
They come back in time.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.880 align:middle line:84%
There's a case I talk
about in the time travelers

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.370 align:middle line:90%
book of Wendy.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.280 align:middle line:90%
She was a very depressed woman.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.580 align:middle line:84%
She was a compulsive
eater, depressed.

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And in between the
time she was seeing me

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.810 align:middle line:84%
for regular superconscious
mind tap hypnosis therapy,

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:02.670 align:middle line:84%
she was being abducted
in between sessions.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So she's
taken aboard a craft.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And there's a-- of
course, eventually

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:08.730 align:middle line:84%
there is the time
traveler, the human,

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:10.920 align:middle line:90%
who's in a conference room.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And he's telepathically
communicating with her,

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.380 align:middle line:84%
and he's showing her
holograms of her past lives.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And he's trying to
educate her spiritually.

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:20.640 align:middle line:84%
This is not a
negative experience.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.110 align:middle line:84%
So he's showing
her where she was

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:23.510 align:middle line:90%
a cave woman getting killed.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.060 align:middle line:84%
She was in ancient Rome,
in the Middle Ages.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Every one of her lives
ended negatively.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:31.255 align:middle line:84%
She was just destroyed,
abandoned, mutilated, whatever.

00:22:31.255 --> 00:22:33.494 align:middle line:84%
And as he's showing her--
so in between sessions,

00:22:33.494 --> 00:22:35.910 align:middle line:84%
so I'm seeing her, she goes,
Doctor, I was abducted again.

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And I said, look, it's
a positive experience.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.570 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you do
something-- since you

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:42.930 align:middle line:84%
can't stop the
abductions, why don't you

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:44.027 align:middle line:90%
just ask a few questions?

00:22:44.027 --> 00:22:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:46.193 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: She goes,
I can't do that.

00:22:46.193 --> 00:22:47.230 align:middle line:90%
I said, yes, you can.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I
should clarify one point.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.940 align:middle line:84%
During these abductions, the
time traveler, the human, 6,

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.490 align:middle line:84%
7 feet tall, he's
getting very emotional.

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:58.170 align:middle line:84%
As he's showing
her all the scenes,

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:90%
he's starting to almost well up.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:01.811 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, that's really odd.

00:23:01.811 --> 00:23:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Because usually, these are
very hard-nosed scientists,

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.060 align:middle line:84%
very objective,
very unemotional.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.790 align:middle line:84%
I said, why don't you ask
him what's the problem?

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:11.520 align:middle line:90%
Why is he so involved?

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.950 align:middle line:90%
And she says, all right.

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:14.701 align:middle line:84%
So the last time she
was abducted he's

00:23:14.701 --> 00:23:15.950 align:middle line:90%
presenting her with the thing.

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And she says my
doctor wants to know

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.550 align:middle line:84%
why you're so
personally involved.

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And he said, because,
Wendy, you're my

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.335 align:middle line:84%
great-great-great-great-great-great-great
 grandmother.

00:23:26.335 --> 00:23:26.876 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Aw.

00:23:26.876 --> 00:23:27.376 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:27.376 --> 00:23:29.323 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Not only
time travelers trace you

00:23:29.323 --> 00:23:30.323 align:middle line:90%
in past lives-- they do.

00:23:30.323 --> 00:23:31.570 align:middle line:90%
They trace you in past lives.

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.190 align:middle line:84%
But they're allowed to
work with their ancestors.

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:35.240 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.262 align:middle line:84%
Now, he also said-- during
her last session with him--

00:23:38.262 --> 00:23:39.720 align:middle line:84%
he said, you're
going to meet a man

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.960 align:middle line:84%
with red hair driving
a white Corvette.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to be a
very significant relationship.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And she thought, what is
this, a dating service?

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.087 align:middle line:90%
What are you, crazy?

00:23:48.087 --> 00:23:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, a year and a half after
we were done with therapy,

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.150 align:middle line:90%
she called me up.

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:53.380 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I met Frank.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.300 align:middle line:90%
He's got red hair.

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:55.580 align:middle line:90%
He drives a white Corvette.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:56.730 align:middle line:90%
And we are engaged.

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And they got married
the following year.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they're going
to give rise to a time traveler,

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.870 align:middle line:90%
a Chrononaut.

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:06.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Two things I want
to get into just

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:84%
so you can lay a
little foundation.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.960 align:middle line:84%
The whole notion
of time travel has

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.010 align:middle line:84%
been fairly well established in
the world of quantum physics.

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Even Stephen Hawking
finally had to come away

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.954 align:middle line:84%
from his prior position and
talk about this infinity--

00:24:20.954 --> 00:24:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, Kip
Thorne is the key.

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Kip Thorne, he had a bet
about several things.

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Kip Thorne's smarter
than Stephen Hawkins.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:26.840 align:middle line:90%
Kip Thorne won the bets.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.280 align:middle line:84%
But Kip Thorne did
something else.

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.260 align:middle line:84%
In September of 1988, there's
a very technical journal

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:33.030 align:middle line:84%
called "The Physical
Review Letters."

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:36.190 align:middle line:84%
He wrote an article about
worm holes, et cetera,

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and about time travel as a
favor to the late Carl Sagan.

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:40.687 align:middle line:90%
Because his novel "Contact--"

00:24:40.687 --> 00:24:41.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: --was being written.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.773 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted it to be
technically accurate.

00:24:43.773 --> 00:24:46.850 align:middle line:84%
This is a scientific article,
hard-nosed scientific article

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:47.935 align:middle line:90%
written 24 years ago.

00:24:47.935 --> 00:24:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kip Thorne?

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Kip Thorne,
Caltech astrophysicist.

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And that article
demonstrates the concept

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.890 align:middle line:84%
of time travel being
theoretically possible,

00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:59.560 align:middle line:84%
enlarging a wormhole, lining
it with exotic matter,

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.050 align:middle line:90%
all the things we know about.

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And he said in his article,
an advanced civilization

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:06.910 align:middle line:84%
in the future would be able to
have the technology to do this.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:09.300 align:middle line:84%
It requires a lot of energy,
which we can't do now.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.050 align:middle line:84%
It also requires
exotic energy, which

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:13.170 align:middle line:84%
has negative mass,
which we don't have now.

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:15.620 align:middle line:84%
But this article has been
challenged by many people.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:16.840 align:middle line:90%
Nobody have disavowed it.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.145 align:middle line:84%
That article stands as a
classic in the literature.

00:25:19.145 --> 00:25:21.770 align:middle line:84%
So in the time travelers book,
I give the scientific reference.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: It's in there, too--

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --if
they want to read it.

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:24.545 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I just
wanted to bring that up.

00:25:24.545 --> 00:25:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So it is
hard-nosed science.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because this
isn't something that's--

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:27.751 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: It's
not science fiction.

00:25:27.751 --> 00:25:29.670 align:middle line:84%
This is hard-nosed,
established, scientific.

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics,
quantum mechanics,

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:34.410 align:middle line:84%
astrophysics all support
the concept, theoretically,

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.590 align:middle line:84%
of time travel by
enlarging worm holes.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.417 align:middle line:84%
And I'll show you how the time
travelers actually do that.

00:25:39.417 --> 00:25:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
wanted to bring it up.

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:43.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a
matter of hearsay

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.250 align:middle line:84%
through regressions
and progressions.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:45.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right.

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:47.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The other point I
wanted to bring up is what you

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.344 align:middle line:84%
just hit on a moment
ago when he said,

00:25:49.344 --> 00:25:51.260 align:middle line:84%
you're my
 great-great-great-great-great-great

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:51.780 align:middle line:90%
grandmother.

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And that is-- A lot of
these-- And this is something

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.440 align:middle line:84%
that I felt had truth in
it about 20 years ago as I

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.590 align:middle line:84%
was listening to this and
reading some of these books.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:06.230 align:middle line:84%
The individuals that have
these abduction experiences

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:09.710 align:middle line:84%
generally have given a
permission on a soul level.

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.270 align:middle line:84%
There's another
agreement going on

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:12.710 align:middle line:84%
that their conscious
mind is not aware of.

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Not all
of them, though.

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:14.415 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are just-- no.

00:26:14.415 --> 00:26:15.302 align:middle line:90%
That's only true on--

00:26:15.302 --> 00:26:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Most of them.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes, there's a
certain percentage of them.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:18.680 align:middle line:90%
That's a karmic indication.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But some
of them are just

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:21.475 align:middle line:84%
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

00:26:21.475 --> 00:26:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:22.540 align:middle line:90%
But I wanted to--

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And they're the
ones that are traumatized.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And they're the ones that
have the post traumatic stress

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:25.660 align:middle line:90%
disorder.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:25.995 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:25.995 --> 00:26:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK?

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:27.493 align:middle line:84%
Because I work
with lots of those,

00:26:27.493 --> 00:26:28.640 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of those
over the years.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
others have actually--

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.665 align:middle line:84%
maybe they're going through
this and having the same kind

00:26:32.665 --> 00:26:34.510 align:middle line:84%
of stress, but have
no remembrance--

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that they
have this agreement.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.440 align:middle line:84%
They just don't know
on a conscious level.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right, of course.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.495 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you've got
a little bit of both.

00:26:39.495 --> 00:26:43.490 align:middle line:84%
It's not always just at
gunpoint, so to speak.

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:47.720 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about, now, going
from the Reptilian experience

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.390 align:middle line:84%
you were talking about
to Zeta Reticuli.

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And I've forgotten the name of
the documents-- they're still

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.470 align:middle line:84%
on the web-- of the group
of six or seven individuals,

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:00.070 align:middle line:84%
and I believe they
were are military,

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:03.350 align:middle line:84%
that were taken
to Zeta Reticuli.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:06.446 align:middle line:84%
And they were worked
with on their planet.

00:27:06.446 --> 00:27:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm not familiar with that.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:08.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm not familiar with that.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:08.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But I'll
tell you one thing.

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:10.890 align:middle line:84%
The government sure isn't
going to acknowledge it.

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:11.770 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:14.192 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
I'll dig this up.

00:27:14.192 --> 00:27:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You're not going
to see that on CBS News.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.210 align:middle line:90%
I can tell you that.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, your'e not.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about
their experience

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.538 align:middle line:84%
of what they were shown,
what they were taught.

00:27:20.538 --> 00:27:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And there have even
been some people's work

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:28.520 align:middle line:84%
indicating that those beings are
also genetically linked to us

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:29.340 align:middle line:90%
from the future.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.257 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying that
is not true or is true?

00:27:31.257 --> 00:27:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: No, it can be.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.214 align:middle line:90%
Look, let's go back.

00:27:33.214 --> 00:27:35.505 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You said they lost
their fertility abilities.

00:27:35.505 --> 00:27:36.630 align:middle line:84%
They've lost their
digestive tracts.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, they're
having lots of difficulties.

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.600 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And
therefore, they need

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.720 align:middle line:84%
to have some of our
genetics to compensate.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.725 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to
President Eisenhower.

00:27:42.725 --> 00:27:43.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: In-- what was it--
1954, he was in California.

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:49.167 align:middle line:10%
And he was called in to
the Edwards Airforce Base.

00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:49.750 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:51.750 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: And that was
the deal that was made.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:54.680 align:middle line:10%
The ETs, the Greys,
wanted to do abductions.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.544 align:middle line:10%
And they said, we'll
make you an exchange.

00:27:56.544 --> 00:27:58.960 align:middle line:84%
You let us abduct some of your
citizens, some of them that

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.770 align:middle line:90%
didn't make soul contracts, OK?

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.540 align:middle line:90%
And we will give you technology.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
spikes of technology

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.500 align:middle line:84%
in the last 100
years, they've always

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.490 align:middle line:84%
correlated with
UFO observations.

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:09.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:12.376 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: 1895, 1896, many
cities in the United States

00:28:12.376 --> 00:28:13.750 align:middle line:84%
had-- they didn't
call them UFOS,

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.140 align:middle line:84%
but they were UFO sightings,
reported in newspapers

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:17.610 align:middle line:90%
all over the country.

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Kitty Hawk, 1903, airplanes, OK?

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:21.994 align:middle line:90%
The Roswell, 1947, in July.

00:28:21.994 --> 00:28:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Roswell, New
Mexico, computers going crazy.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Shrinking them, a
massive expansion.

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:32.950 align:middle line:84%
'54, '73, all of the massive
UFO sightings and the numbers,

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:34.160 align:middle line:90%
the volume of numbers.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And with those came
advances in technology.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.740 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like
the deal was made.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like
somebody is-- the problem

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.120 align:middle line:84%
is they made a few more
abductions than they

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:42.830 align:middle line:90%
were supposed to.

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:44.121 align:middle line:90%
And they violated the contract.

00:28:44.121 --> 00:28:45.372 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:28:45.372 --> 00:28:46.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is documented.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Philip Corso's work,
its documented there.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The late
Philip Corso, yes.

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Phil Schneider.

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Yes.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Same thing.

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Many people have.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So, but getting back to the idea
of the government mentality,

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.245 align:middle line:84%
too, is that remember,
the government's

00:28:56.245 --> 00:28:57.620 align:middle line:84%
never going to
admit to anything.

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.792 align:middle line:84%
They don't even admit
that there are UFOs.

00:28:59.792 --> 00:29:01.750 align:middle line:84%
The Mexican government
is much more open minded

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:02.495 align:middle line:90%
and so is South America.

00:29:02.495 --> 00:29:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Chilean and others,
they're much more open to it.

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Brazil.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They have
their military people

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:06.310 align:middle line:90%
talking about this.

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But our
government, they just

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:09.070 align:middle line:90%
have the Men in Black mentality.

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:10.986 align:middle line:84%
They just don't believe
in-- they're paranoid,

00:29:10.986 --> 00:29:12.080 align:middle line:90%
and they want to control.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.650 align:middle line:90%
And they don't trust the public.

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:14.770 align:middle line:84%
They think everybody's
going to panic,

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:16.020 align:middle line:90%
which is not true at all.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:20.190 align:middle line:84%
But the point is is that these
Zeta Reticulis now, remember,

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:22.530 align:middle line:90%
they are working with us.

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:23.575 align:middle line:90%
So here's an example.

00:29:23.575 --> 00:29:25.700 align:middle line:84%
One of my cases in "Time
Travelers From Our Future"

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.510 align:middle line:90%
is a woman who is abducted.

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:30.100 align:middle line:90%
Sperm and egg samples are taken.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And when she was a young girl,
she was like 16 years old,

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.236 align:middle line:90%
she was pregnant supposedly.

00:29:35.236 --> 00:29:36.235 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was this Tina?

00:29:36.235 --> 00:29:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Tina.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:37.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The case of Tina?

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:37.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And
she was pregnant.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.223 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, she goes
to a gynecologist a couple weeks

00:29:41.223 --> 00:29:43.830 align:middle line:84%
later, and she says,
we did the sonograms,

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:45.450 align:middle line:90%
and you're no longer pregnant.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.360 align:middle line:90%
There was no blood.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.320 align:middle line:90%
There was no tissues being lost.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.750 align:middle line:90%
What happened to the fetus?

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:51.940 align:middle line:90%
She said, I don't know.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.356 align:middle line:84%
All I know is
you're not pregnant.

00:29:53.356 --> 00:29:54.520 align:middle line:90%
And go on with your life.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.950 align:middle line:90%
Well, so years go by.

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:58.370 align:middle line:90%
Now, she has other abductions.

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Finally, she's taken
to a military base

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:03.360 align:middle line:84%
with Air Force
uniforms, et cetera.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yup.

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:04.335 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:30:04.335 --> 00:30:06.300 align:middle line:90%
So we've got a conspiracy here.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And she is taken on a
tour of this military base

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:13.550 align:middle line:84%
where they're like half human,
half ET or Zeta Reticuli

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:14.390 align:middle line:90%
fetuses.

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:17.642 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, she's
shown her daughter.

00:30:17.642 --> 00:30:18.225 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:18.225 --> 00:30:19.766 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Her hybrid daughter.

00:30:19.766 --> 00:30:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was like they were
telepathically communicating,

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:23.540 align:middle line:90%
at least the daughter was.

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And that was a daughter
who was about 16 years old,

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:27.940 align:middle line:84%
because that was x
number of years ago.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:31.500 align:middle line:84%
So this is an example of how
the hybridization comes in,

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.290 align:middle line:84%
how the interbreeding
is coming in.

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And the history of our
species if you go through it

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.790 align:middle line:84%
with Altantis and
the Lemuria, we all

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:40.320 align:middle line:90%
have extraterrestrial genetics.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: It's a
question of degrees.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nobody's
really from here.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:43.340 align:middle line:90%
No one's indigenous.

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.025 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: There's
no such thing.

00:30:44.025 --> 00:30:44.330 align:middle line:90%
We're all mutts.

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:45.413 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're all mutts.

00:30:45.413 --> 00:30:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, I interviewed a
woman named Kim Carlsberg.

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:51.657 align:middle line:84%
And she had had a lifelong--
well, for probably 15,

00:30:51.657 --> 00:30:54.760 align:middle line:84%
20 years anyway-- of
this same experience.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And over time-- and
she was terrified.

00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:58.300 align:middle line:90%
It ruined her life.

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Her bodily cycles
weren't working properly.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right.

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:03.245 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Same thing.

00:31:03.245 --> 00:31:05.240 align:middle line:84%
She was pregnant,
then not pregnant.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Seemingly pregnant,
then not pregnant.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And she had recall of
the abduction experiences

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately, the
same thing happened.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.640 align:middle line:84%
She was introduced to her
daughter, who at the time

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.590 align:middle line:90%
was 14 years old.

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:17.900 align:middle line:90%
She was a hybrid.

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.940 align:middle line:84%
She looked very much like
her, only paler, thinner,

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.350 align:middle line:90%
and had a very high IQ.

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And telepathically,
when they communicated,

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:29.650 align:middle line:84%
the girl felt very badly for
leaving her mother behind.

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:34.710 align:middle line:84%
But the Greys that were involved
with the cloning-- not cloning,

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:36.800 align:middle line:84%
but the genetic
engineering project--

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:42.050 align:middle line:84%
were saying to her very proudly,
we're so proud of this girl.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't
understand what it takes.

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And they showed her
other malformed beings

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:48.490 align:middle line:90%
that had happened--

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Sure.

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --in
their attempts to--

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The experiments
that didn't work out.

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The experiments
that didn't work out.

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:53.110 align:middle line:84%
They said we've
been doing this--

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: It's like "The
Island of Doctor Moreau"

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:55.442 align:middle line:90%
here coming actually.

00:31:55.442 --> 00:31:56.192 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:31:56.192 --> 00:31:59.415 align:middle line:84%
And they were explaining to
her, we need this for ourselves.

00:31:59.415 --> 00:32:01.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Now, remember,
telepathic communication

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:02.090 align:middle line:90%
is critical.

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Because
your average person

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.130 align:middle line:84%
doesn't go around telepathically
communicating, see?

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But the
ETs can master that.

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:08.340 align:middle line:90%
And so did the Time Travelers.

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:08.840 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And this girl.

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.700 align:middle line:84%
This daughter was
doing the same.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So that's
another evidence--

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --that
this is not just

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:15.290 align:middle line:90%
somebody playing games with her.

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:17.126 align:middle line:90%
You can't fake telepathy.

00:32:17.126 --> 00:32:19.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and she
felt this overwhelming love

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.470 align:middle line:90%
for this hybrid girl.

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Right, of course.

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:21.245 align:middle line:90%
Why should she?

00:32:21.245 --> 00:32:22.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a
maternal instinct.

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:23.369 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:32:23.369 --> 00:32:24.000 align:middle line:90%
So that, too.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.716 align:middle line:84%
The feelings were
this wasn't a joke.

00:32:26.716 --> 00:32:27.590 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a hologram.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:30.050 align:middle line:84%
It was something she
was very tied to.

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:32.560 align:middle line:84%
But it was very similar
to Tina's experience.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And again, this whole
thing about, as you say,

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.919 align:middle line:84%
they have in the future lost
their ability to procreate.

00:32:37.919 --> 00:32:39.835 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, they're not
very fertile anymore.

00:32:39.835 --> 00:32:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Right,
they're panicking.

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:41.860 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
to become extinct.

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: That's
the whole point,

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:43.770 align:middle line:90%
the survival of the species.

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they're looking
to vitalize their own space.

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: By the
way, another thing,

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.690 align:middle line:84%
just a little scientific
thing about fifth dimension.

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:50.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a gentleman who's
a Professor of Mathematics

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:51.783 align:middle line:90%
at Brown University.

00:32:51.783 --> 00:32:53.850 align:middle line:90%
His name is Thomas Banchoff.

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And what Thomas has done is
he's developed software programs

00:32:57.370 --> 00:32:59.330 align:middle line:84%
to get images of
the fifth dimension

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.007 align:middle line:84%
onto two dimensional
computer screens.

00:33:01.007 --> 00:33:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And he goes around the
country giving talks.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.900 align:middle line:90%
He's an academic guy.

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.570 align:middle line:90%
He's speaking to his colleagues.

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:08.970 align:middle line:84%
This isn't just a
lay presentation.

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:11.436 align:middle line:84%
So we now have further evidence
of the fifth dimension.

00:33:11.436 --> 00:33:12.810 align:middle line:84%
They call them
higher dimensions.

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's wonderful.

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But that's
the fifth dimension.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:17.750 align:middle line:84%
He teaches differential
geometry at Brown University.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's take that
and then go into-- we've

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:22.880 align:middle line:90%
gone through the Reptilians.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.630 align:middle line:84%
We've gone through the
Greys a little bit.

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:27.192 align:middle line:10%
Now, anything else you want
to share about the Greys?

00:33:27.192 --> 00:33:28.900 align:middle line:10%
I mean, again, the
same portrait comes up

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.210 align:middle line:10%
with John Mack's work,
Kim Carlsberg, your work,

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:33.430 align:middle line:10%
that there's not a lot
of empathy for the people

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:34.430 align:middle line:10%
that have been abducted.

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:35.310 align:middle line:90%
It's just a job.

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:36.726 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: No,
they're very cold.

00:33:36.726 --> 00:33:39.190 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the same
kind of nervous system as us.

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:40.660 align:middle line:90%
They don't cry and tear up.

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.826 align:middle line:10%
But one thing, just for the
benefit of the audience,

00:33:42.826 --> 00:33:45.379 align:middle line:10%
if you're ever abducted out
there in television land,

00:33:45.379 --> 00:33:47.420 align:middle line:10%
there are many ways you
can prevent an abduction.

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:47.730 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:48.940 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: So let's say
you've got the Greys.

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:50.415 align:middle line:10%
They have the stare, the
hypnotic stare they talk about.

00:33:50.415 --> 00:33:50.998 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:33:50.998 --> 00:33:52.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And they
paralyze the person.

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Number one, you want to use
St. John's wort as an herb.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:02.492 align:middle line:84%
And you can rub your body
with pennyroil as an oil.

00:34:02.492 --> 00:34:03.200 align:middle line:90%
That's one thing.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.480 align:middle line:90%
You may not have that around.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:08.300 align:middle line:84%
But if you wear iron, especially
a religious crucifix or some

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.620 align:middle line:84%
religious in iron,
salt, and magnets.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.848 align:middle line:90%
They can't take that.

00:34:12.848 --> 00:34:13.389 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:16.199 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Another thing is
you confront them and say, yo,

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:17.806 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to be abducted, OK?

00:34:17.806 --> 00:34:18.639 align:middle line:90%
Not going to happen.

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:18.969 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Be proactive.

00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: That's right.

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:22.139 align:middle line:90%
Be New York about it, OK?

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:22.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:23.719 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Develop an attitude.

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:24.310 align:middle line:90%
They don't like that.

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:25.250 align:middle line:90%
They're very wimpy about it.

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:25.790 align:middle line:90%
They don't like that.

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:26.330 align:middle line:90%
That won't fight you.

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:27.110 align:middle line:90%
They aren't going to tackle you.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:29.239 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they really deal
more off of passivity and fear.

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:29.949 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Very much passive.

00:34:29.949 --> 00:34:30.159 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And fear.

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Because
they're frail.

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget, they're
very frail beings.

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.139 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They're very-- what
do they weigh, like 80 pounds?

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:36.759 align:middle line:84%
You know what I mean? so they
can't really beat us up, OK?

00:34:36.759 --> 00:34:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:38.949 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But if they
see a confrontation,

00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:39.739 align:middle line:90%
you know what they do?

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:41.980 align:middle line:84%
They walk on by and go to
somebody who won't do that.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.909 align:middle line:84%
So basically, you confront
them, the iron, et cetera,

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:46.223 align:middle line:90%
the magnet, the salt, whatever.

00:34:46.223 --> 00:34:46.889 align:middle line:90%
You do all that.

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:48.347 align:middle line:84%
You can use white
light protection,

00:34:48.347 --> 00:34:49.719 align:middle line:90%
spiritual protection techniques.

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:51.960 align:middle line:84%
You can focus on one of
your fingers or toes,

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:52.960 align:middle line:90%
especially your fingers.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.664 align:middle line:84%
Just focusing on it,
you're breaking the stare.

00:34:54.664 --> 00:34:55.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They can't
work with you that way.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:57.660 align:middle line:90%
They can't paralyze you.

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots of ways you can
do this to prevent and stop it

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:01.784 align:middle line:90%
in the intermediary.

00:35:01.784 --> 00:35:03.241 align:middle line:84%
Now, one thing I
should tell people

00:35:03.241 --> 00:35:05.116 align:middle line:84%
out there who try to do
really stupid things.

00:35:05.116 --> 00:35:06.532 align:middle line:84%
One of my patients
says, you know,

00:35:06.532 --> 00:35:08.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to bring a digital
camera or my cell phone.

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:10.861 align:middle line:84%
You think they don't
understand that concept?

00:35:10.861 --> 00:35:11.735 align:middle line:90%
You can't photograph.

00:35:11.735 --> 00:35:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:13.593 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And you
can't bring a cell

00:35:13.593 --> 00:35:16.190 align:middle line:84%
phone or a digital camera or
one of those spy microphones.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.690 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:17.500 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to happen.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:18.666 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not going to work.

00:35:18.666 --> 00:35:20.010 align:middle line:90%
And besides, it's telepathic.

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:20.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, another understanding
here, let's go back to Tina

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:25.286 align:middle line:84%
for just a moment
before we move on.

00:35:25.286 --> 00:35:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At the end of all
these years of experience, what

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:31.590 align:middle line:84%
they were doing
simultaneously to somehow,

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:34.200 align:middle line:84%
I guess, sweeten the pot
a bit, and also maybe it's

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:38.200 align:middle line:84%
part of the deal, is to show
her what the Earth was going

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.950 align:middle line:84%
through, what was needed, what
the future was going to hold.

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And she walked away, ultimately,
after meeting the daughter,

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:46.970 align:middle line:84%
feeling as though her
world had been greatly

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:48.360 align:middle line:90%
expanded, her own ability--

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And her
own spiritual growth.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And her
own spiritual growth.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:50.856 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:35:50.856 --> 00:35:51.272 align:middle line:90%
And her capabilities.

00:35:51.272 --> 00:35:52.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Because
the purpose of the time

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.360 align:middle line:84%
travelers is always
to facilitate

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.280 align:middle line:90%
our spiritual growth.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Except for Reptilians.

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:57.328 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, yeah.

00:35:57.328 --> 00:36:00.510 align:middle line:84%
But those aren't real time--
they're like stowaways.

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:01.010 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:02.290 align:middle line:90%
So I don't really count them.

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:04.510 align:middle line:84%
But the time travelers,
what's their incentive?

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
us in the future.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.000 align:middle line:84%
So the better we
are as a society,

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.720 align:middle line:84%
the easier it's
going to be on them.

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Because
we could mess things

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:12.630 align:middle line:90%
up for them big time.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:14.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: We could
have nuclear wars.

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:15.686 align:middle line:84%
We can do some
really dumb things,

00:36:15.686 --> 00:36:17.330 align:middle line:90%
which will affect the future.

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:19.600 align:middle line:84%
But Tina, as well as
Wendy, by the way,

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.920 align:middle line:84%
too, as well as the other dozens
and dozens of time traveler

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.540 align:middle line:84%
abductees I've
worked with, they've

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.400 align:middle line:84%
all benefited
spiritually from this.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.750 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:30.040 align:middle line:84%
In many cases, Wendy
overcame depression

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.850 align:middle line:90%
and compulsive overeating.

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:33.790 align:middle line:90%
And they all have their issues.

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:35.095 align:middle line:90%
Tina had her issues, too.

00:36:35.095 --> 00:36:35.970 align:middle line:90%
They all have issues.

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:37.790 align:middle line:84%
That's why they come
to me as a therapist,

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:39.220 align:middle line:90%
for soul healing as I call it.

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.310 align:middle line:84%
But my point is
but the interaction

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:44.220 align:middle line:84%
with the time traveler
teams always benefits them.

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, people who interact
just with the Greys

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:48.120 align:middle line:84%
from this century
aren't always benefited.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.710 align:middle line:84%
You do get post
traumatic stress.

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Diffferent
experience, yeah.

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And you have people
with negative experiences.

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:53.790 align:middle line:84%
But the time travelers
are really the key.

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
us in the future.

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.010 align:middle line:90%
And they want to help us.

00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And they give us our
technology as we'll

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:02.030 align:middle line:84%
see with Egypt and all
the other civilizations.

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:04.009 align:middle line:84%
And to me, don't be
afraid of time travelers.

00:37:04.009 --> 00:37:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to the
hybridized time travelers,

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:09.100 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are coming that
are part-human, part-alien.

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.330 align:middle line:84%
You said once you
get up close, you

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:12.080 align:middle line:84%
can see their foreheads
are different and so forth.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And
the faceted eyes.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:14.331 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
eyes are different.

00:37:14.331 --> 00:37:17.570 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that particular group,

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:20.350 align:middle line:84%
how they function, how
they're perceived when people

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:22.630 align:middle line:84%
are in these progressions,
and what they bring.

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:24.720 align:middle line:84%
First, what happens is, you
have to understand, the time

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.870 align:middle line:84%
traveler team-- now, we have
to separate time travelers

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:27.560 align:middle line:90%
from two phases.

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:31.480 align:middle line:84%
One is the first
phase of time travel.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Kip Thorne's article does give
some of the mechanics of it.

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:37.720 align:middle line:84%
But the futuristic Taatos,
the man in the year 3050

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.920 align:middle line:84%
who develops it, develops what's
called the Wormhole Linear

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Accelerator or what
they call the WLA.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And what the Wormhole
Linear Accelerator does

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:49.100 align:middle line:84%
is enlarges a wormhole
to classic size, which

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.590 align:middle line:84%
is what Kip Thorne
says is possible

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:52.423 align:middle line:84%
if you've got the energy
and the technology,

00:37:52.423 --> 00:37:53.930 align:middle line:90%
which we don't have yet.

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And then the craft goes in there
with the time traveler team.

00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:57.800 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.480 align:middle line:84%
The problem in doing
that is you cause

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.560 align:middle line:84%
a tear in the fabric of
spacetime every time you

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.400 align:middle line:90%
do that.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.430 align:middle line:84%
So what that means, we
have weather problems, we

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:06.710 align:middle line:90%
have earthquakes, tsunamis.

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:07.790 align:middle line:90%
Fish fall from the sky.

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:11.000 align:middle line:84%
You know those stories, the
14 phenomena we call that.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Those are all
due-- many of those

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:14.850 align:middle line:84%
are due to these tears in
the fabric of spacetime.

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:16.559 align:middle line:84%
That will be stopped
in the 35th century.

00:38:16.559 --> 00:38:18.516 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you in a
moment how that happens.

00:38:18.516 --> 00:38:20.700 align:middle line:84%
But basically what happens
is you have two Greys.

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:21.300 align:middle line:90%
They are the gophers.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.870 align:middle line:84%
They are the lowest
level of the team.

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:23.940 align:middle line:90%
They will do the dirty work.

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.106 align:middle line:90%
They will do the abductions.

00:38:25.106 --> 00:38:26.734 align:middle line:90%
They will clean the restrooms.

00:38:26.734 --> 00:38:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Worker bees.

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:29.108 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The
worker bees, right.

00:38:29.108 --> 00:38:31.760 align:middle line:84%
The hybrids are the
supervisors to them.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.060 align:middle line:84%
They'll be the technicians
running the studies,

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.800 align:middle line:84%
or running the
tests on the things,

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:37.590 align:middle line:84%
getting things done
on a higher level.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And then the big
cheese is the human,

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:42.640 align:middle line:84%
the pure human is the
one who correlates them.

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.181 align:middle line:84%
He is the one who
will interview them

00:38:44.181 --> 00:38:46.250 align:middle line:84%
in the conference room
or the military base.

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:50.430 align:middle line:84%
He's the one who will maximize
most of their spiritual growth,

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:55.160 align:middle line:84%
show them the holograms of their
past lives, as we shall see.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And he correlates everything
and gets everything together.

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:02.340 align:middle line:84%
He spends most of the time
with the abductee in educating

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:05.040 align:middle line:84%
them and helping them with
their own spiritual growth.

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And there are devices they use
to cleanse the soul, to raise

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:11.500 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness level, healing
as well as spiritual growth.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.480 align:middle line:84%
So the hybrids really
are-- they're supervisors.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.800 align:middle line:90%
But they're really technicians.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:19.130 align:middle line:84%
The pure human time traveler
is the one that really counts.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:22.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But their actions
are generally taken away

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:22.926 align:middle line:90%
as positive--

00:39:22.926 --> 00:39:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, yeah.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --on the person
that's gone through this.

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.122 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And the Greys are
positive on the time traveler

00:39:26.122 --> 00:39:26.790 align:middle line:90%
team, too.

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:27.183 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:27.183 --> 00:39:27.379 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Sure.

00:39:27.379 --> 00:39:27.970 align:middle line:90%
They're all positive.

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:28.511 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:28.511 --> 00:39:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's move up to more
of the Pleiadian, the Nordic,

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.060 align:middle line:90%
and also the pure humans.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And talk about what that means
to be pure human in the future.

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.904 align:middle line:84%
Because the Pleiadians are
the most like us, right?

00:39:42.904 --> 00:39:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: The Pleiadians,
they're not really

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.111 align:middle line:90%
part of the time traveler team.

00:39:46.111 --> 00:39:46.932 align:middle line:90%
The Greys are.

00:39:46.932 --> 00:39:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Pleiadians live in the
Pleiadian constellation.

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:49.515 align:middle line:90%
They come here.

00:39:49.515 --> 00:39:53.100 align:middle line:84%
But they're not functioning as
time travelers per-- they're

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:53.646 align:middle line:90%
gatekeepers.

00:39:53.646 --> 00:39:54.770 align:middle line:90%
They can go back and forth.

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:56.140 align:middle line:84%
But they're not part
of the government team.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:56.970 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm talking about.

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:57.285 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:57.285 --> 00:39:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I'm
talking about the team.

00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:58.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:01.700 align:middle line:84%
As far as the pure
human, how's this?

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.880 align:middle line:84%
My very favorite century,
which I described in the time

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.290 align:middle line:84%
travelers book in detail,
is the 35th century.

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:09.730 align:middle line:84%
It's the highest level of
technological and spiritual

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:12.180 align:middle line:84%
growth of any century
in human history.

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's the 35th
century citizen like?

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:16.375 align:middle line:90%
They work about 15 hours a week.

00:40:16.375 --> 00:40:18.040 align:middle line:90%
They have plenty of free time.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:21.015 align:middle line:84%
They live to be between
500 to 900 years young.

00:40:21.015 --> 00:40:21.515 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:40:21.515 --> 00:40:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of
like in the deep past.

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:25.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And when you're
600 or 700 years old,

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.351 align:middle line:90%
you only look about 300.

00:40:26.351 --> 00:40:27.350 align:middle line:90%
So it looks pretty good.

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:27.975 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:27.975 --> 00:40:29.250 align:middle line:90%
It looks pretty good.

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:29.750 align:middle line:90%
The new 30.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:30.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They're
very spiritual.

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:31.970 align:middle line:90%
There's no poverty.

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:33.390 align:middle line:90%
There's no unemployment.

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:34.650 align:middle line:90%
There's no diseases.

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:36.390 align:middle line:90%
Cancer, AIDS, they're all gone.

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:39.560 align:middle line:84%
They have a beautiful
spiritual life.

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.020 align:middle line:84%
The world is very positive,
and the technology.

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Here's some technology
from the future.

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:46.220 align:middle line:90%
This is, I think, really cool.

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Taatos, the 31st
century-- he was

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.890 align:middle line:90%
like the da Vinci of his time.

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:53.350 align:middle line:84%
He was a physician,
he was a philosopher,

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:56.120 align:middle line:84%
archaeologist,
anthropologist, you name it.

00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:00.330 align:middle line:84%
They memorialize him what's
called The Land of Taatos.

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:01.540 align:middle line:90%
It's an amusement park.

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:04.500 align:middle line:84%
But what it is, it floats about
3,000 feet above the Earth,

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.442 align:middle line:84%
has a force field around it, so
you can't fall over the edge.

00:41:07.442 --> 00:41:08.400 align:middle line:90%
And what you do there--

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.620 align:middle line:90%
There aren't rides there.

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.559 align:middle line:84%
What you do is you
go up there, and you

00:41:11.559 --> 00:41:13.350 align:middle line:84%
go back to the Renaissance
for the weekend.

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:14.550 align:middle line:90%
You do time travel.

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's called The
Land of Taatos.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:19.650 align:middle line:84%
A very interesting device, it's
called a alphis equiliarium.

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:23.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a device that sends
both light and sounds

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:25.380 align:middle line:84%
and light energy
through the body,

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.220 align:middle line:84%
stimulating the adrenal
glands of the gonads, which

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:33.380 align:middle line:84%
produces the hormone DHEA, which
becomes either testosterone

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:34.830 align:middle line:90%
in men or estrogen in women.

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:38.725 align:middle line:84%
Intermediary, it fights cancer
by stimulating the T cells,

00:41:38.725 --> 00:41:40.150 align:middle line:90%
T lymphocytes.

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:43.600 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is that
by stimulating the DHEA,

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:47.030 align:middle line:84%
you can build up the immune
system, which is why we age.

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:50.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you do this alphis
equilarium, what happens

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:52.800 align:middle line:84%
is you're going to slow down
the aging process significantly.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.702 align:middle line:84%
So they live to
be 500 years old.

00:41:54.702 --> 00:41:56.410 align:middle line:84%
Then one of the other
machines they have,

00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:57.440 align:middle line:90%
let's say your in the kitchen.

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.930 align:middle line:90%
And you want a chicken sandwich.

00:41:58.930 --> 00:41:59.657 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:59.657 --> 00:42:01.490 align:middle line:84%
You go to a machine,
looks like a microwave.

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:03.400 align:middle line:84%
Except, you think I
want a chicken sandwich.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Your thought waves creates
the chicken sandwich.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.800 align:middle line:84%
I call this the
mindwich machine.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.490 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:09.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's a food processor.

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:11.400 align:middle line:84%
But the food is
perfectly nutritious.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.733 align:middle line:90%
You can eat as much as you want.

00:42:12.733 --> 00:42:13.780 align:middle line:90%
You won't gain weight.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And so it's all done
by thought energy.

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:16.905 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:42:16.905 --> 00:42:18.280 align:middle line:84%
You could have a
room-- let's say

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.860 align:middle line:90%
you have a very small apartment.

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:22.310 align:middle line:84%
You can use technology
to lengthen it,

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:24.840 align:middle line:84%
so that you can store all
kinds of objects there.

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Make it gigantic
like a warehouse,

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and then shrink it down
to its regular size.

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And you can have, like,
the holodeck on Star Trek

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:34.415 align:middle line:90%
if you remember that.

00:42:34.415 --> 00:42:34.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: You
could have things

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:36.870 align:middle line:90%
like that for entertainment.

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:38.750 align:middle line:84%
So people can
relax and chill out

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:41.014 align:middle line:84%
without having to go on
vacations or to go places.

00:42:41.014 --> 00:42:43.430 align:middle line:84%
In your home, you're going to
have a teleportation device.

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:45.463 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: This is for
local teleportation,

00:42:45.463 --> 00:42:47.010 align:middle line:90%
by the 25th century, by the way.

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:49.760 align:middle line:84%
So you can teleport across
town or across the country

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:52.700 align:middle line:84%
or across the world in
your teleportation device.

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.550 align:middle line:90%
So there will be teleportation.

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:58.770 align:middle line:84%
But now, by the 35th century,
the biggest century in my world

00:42:58.770 --> 00:42:59.332 align:middle line:90%
here--

00:42:59.332 --> 00:43:00.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is-- many people

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:02.060 align:middle line:90%
have looked into this century.

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, yeah.

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Many.

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Let
me just complete--

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:05.580 align:middle line:84%
and I'll give you
the corroboration.

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: In the 35th
century, teleportation

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:10.180 align:middle line:84%
will now be the
mode of time travel.

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:12.300 align:middle line:84%
The advantage of that, we
have this little-- looks

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.229 align:middle line:84%
like a little transistor
radio on their belt.

00:43:14.229 --> 00:43:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's got like a
little red dot to them,

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.470 align:middle line:84%
so a time traveler can
make sure they're alive.

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:20.490 align:middle line:84%
If the red dot is
active, they're alive.

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:22.040 align:middle line:84%
So make sure they
don't get killed

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.899 align:middle line:84%
by somebody else
in another century.

00:43:23.899 --> 00:43:25.940 align:middle line:84%
The teleportation, they
push a button, literally,

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:27.570 align:middle line:90%
and they're back in time.

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:29.760 align:middle line:84%
No tears in the
fabric of spacetime.

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.871 align:middle line:84%
It's very
environmentally positive,

00:43:31.871 --> 00:43:33.370 align:middle line:84%
you see, compared
to the other ways.

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:33.702 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:43:33.702 --> 00:43:33.870 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:34.495 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:43:34.495 --> 00:43:35.914 align:middle line:84%
Now, as far as
the corroboration,

00:43:35.914 --> 00:43:37.830 align:middle line:84%
people say, where do you
get this information?

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Because as far as I
know, I'm the only one

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:41.580 align:middle line:84%
in the world that
I know of that has

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:46.290 align:middle line:84%
active cases, clinical cases,
of real time travelers.

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I wrote "Time
Travelers From Our Future,"

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:52.440 align:middle line:84%
I received, oh, about 30 or
40 different people giving me

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:53.910 align:middle line:90%
the same scenarios.

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:55.440 align:middle line:84%
They had no contact
with each other.

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.570 align:middle line:84%
They were from all
over the world.

00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:58.600 align:middle line:84%
I have an international
practice, Australia,

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.700 align:middle line:84%
South America, Europe,
Canada, you name it.

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.470 align:middle line:84%
So this is called Watley's
Law of Evidence in science.

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Watley's Law of Evidence
says that-- this

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:07.560 align:middle line:84%
is a hard-nosed law,
not a theory-- if people

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.060 align:middle line:84%
from all over the world
describe the same phenomena

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.460 align:middle line:84%
with no contact,
it must be true.

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So Watley's Law of Evidence
would support my time traveler

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:16.180 align:middle line:90%
paradigms.

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:20.620 align:middle line:84%
And there are people--
Bentwater, England in 1980

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:23.670 align:middle line:84%
between December 26th
and December 28th, 1980,

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:25.642 align:middle line:84%
there was a UFO sighting
by the military.

00:44:25.642 --> 00:44:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And there was a Sergeant
James Penniston,

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:29.280 align:middle line:84%
who came forward
many years later.

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.929 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yeah.

00:44:30.929 --> 00:44:31.970 align:middle line:90%
There was a big sighting.

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And not only did
they sight the UFO,

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:35.810 align:middle line:90%
but he reported time travelers.

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:37.380 align:middle line:84%
He reported people
from 1,000 years

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.920 align:middle line:84%
in the future who were
telepathically communicating.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.420 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking
about how they

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:44.365 align:middle line:84%
make many errors in their
time traveler experiments,

00:44:44.365 --> 00:44:45.990 align:middle line:84%
because the beginning
time travelers do

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:47.130 align:middle line:90%
make a lot of errors.

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:49.000 align:middle line:90%
They're kind of like ingenues.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
one corroboration.

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And then in November
1980, the MUFON Journal

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:58.500 align:middle line:84%
reported a case that occurred on
July 4, 1980 in a Naval airbase

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.120 align:middle line:90%
in Catania in Italy.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And what happened there, they
described these two giant time

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:07.560 align:middle line:84%
travelers, people, or let's just
say beings with white robes,

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.105 align:middle line:90%
with these little Greys.

00:45:09.105 --> 00:45:11.480 align:middle line:84%
They called them the Jesus
Christ types they called them.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.660 align:middle line:84%
They were wearing white
robes with sashes.

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And they were
communicating by telepathy,

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:18.810 align:middle line:84%
all the MOs of a
time traveler team.

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:20.064 align:middle line:90%
Twice, military reports.

00:45:20.064 --> 00:45:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:22.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And you know how
hard-nosed the military is.

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: OK.

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So my
point is-- and there

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:26.780 align:middle line:84%
are other people who
have corroborated

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.160 align:middle line:90%
what looks like time travelers.

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.836 align:middle line:84%
But nobody has ever dealt
with them in the detail I do.

00:45:30.836 --> 00:45:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to
get more people

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:34.092 align:middle line:84%
to do so, which is why
I write these books.

00:45:34.092 --> 00:45:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now the people
that you're talking about

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:37.257 align:middle line:90%
have human form.

00:45:37.257 --> 00:45:38.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, yes.

00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:40.697 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They are still the
pure human, but in the future.

00:45:40.697 --> 00:45:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: They're human.

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
because some people

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:49.190 align:middle line:84%
talk about visions in which
they see humans essentially

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:51.420 align:middle line:84%
atrophying into more of
what looks like Greys.

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:52.700 align:middle line:90%
We become hairless again.

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Our digestive tracks
shrivel up and on and on.

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:56.390 align:middle line:90%
You're saying no.

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:57.920 align:middle line:84%
This is still the
pure human intact.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: No.

00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:59.240 align:middle line:84%
We don't evolve--
actually, I'll tell

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.490 align:middle line:84%
you something
about the evolution

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:02.198 align:middle line:84%
here, because I've
read the studies, too,

00:46:02.198 --> 00:46:03.990 align:middle line:90%
more details of this.

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:06.140 align:middle line:84%
When you look upon
humans evolving,

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:07.720 align:middle line:90%
they don't evolve into Greys.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it looks like more
Reptilian than the Greys.

00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:12.969 align:middle line:84%
They have this like--
well, what they

00:46:12.969 --> 00:46:14.510 align:middle line:84%
say is it's not so
much our evolving.

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:17.420 align:middle line:84%
They say, like, if you take a
dinosaur from 65 million years

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.310 align:middle line:84%
ago, if they were
around today, they

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:21.390 align:middle line:90%
would look like a Reptilian.

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:23.280 align:middle line:84%
They would be a
human-like figure,

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.160 align:middle line:84%
but they would have
the Reptilian aspect.

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, our species, if we're
going to evolve into anything,

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:28.140 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be Pleiadian.

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:29.820 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be more
the Nordic types.

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:31.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, which is
still very human looking.

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Even though
we have ET genes,

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.859 align:middle line:84%
remember, the
Pleiadians are ETs, too.

00:46:33.859 --> 00:46:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, exactly.

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:37.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So their genes
are very simpatico to us.

00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:39.582 align:middle line:84%
They could have a
role on "90211."

00:46:39.582 --> 00:46:40.790 align:middle line:90%
I mena, they look very human.

00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So I
wouldn't look upon us--

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.946 align:middle line:84%
our future is actually
quite positive.

00:46:44.946 --> 00:46:46.820 align:middle line:10%
Contrary to what most
people are getting now,

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:49.000 align:middle line:10%
is all the negative
stuff, the gloom and doom,

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.820 align:middle line:10%
episodes of "Fringe,"
where observers

00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:53.640 align:middle line:10%
take over the world from the
future-- forget that, folks.

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.390 align:middle line:10%
This is going to be
a very-- this century

00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:56.370 align:middle line:10%
is a tough century.

00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:57.800 align:middle line:84%
When you get beyond
this century,

00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:02.650 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be Star Trek
time without the evil guys,

00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:03.264 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:47:03.264 --> 00:47:05.680 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, and they say
the military has technologies

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:08.096 align:middle line:10%
that are at least 100 years
in advance of what we're privy

00:47:08.096 --> 00:47:09.250 align:middle line:10%
to right now anyway.

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:11.942 align:middle line:10%
So then exponentially, just
like the computer industry,

00:47:11.942 --> 00:47:12.900 align:middle line:10%
that has to be growing.

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:14.660 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Remember,
everything goes military first.

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: When the
Kitty Hawk occurred,

00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Teddy Roosevelt said we want
those for the military first.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.821 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When
computers were set up,

00:47:20.821 --> 00:47:22.477 align:middle line:84%
the first emails
were all military.

00:47:22.477 --> 00:47:24.810 align:middle line:84%
The corporations weren't given
it till many years later.

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:26.835 align:middle line:84%
So military always
gets top priority.

00:47:26.835 --> 00:47:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And for national security,
you can understand that.

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.990 align:middle line:84%
If they would just lose their
paranoia, I'd like them.

00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:32.114 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no kidding.

00:47:32.114 --> 00:47:35.800 align:middle line:84%
One time a few years ago, I
did a little brief progression.

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.190 align:middle line:90%
And it was a group progression.

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And I've done loads and loads
of regressions over time

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:42.680 align:middle line:84%
into different parts of
history and snooped around.

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:47.847 align:middle line:84%
But in this one, it was a
very beautiful way of living.

00:47:47.847 --> 00:47:49.430 align:middle line:84%
We were living in
harmony with nature.

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:50.740 align:middle line:90%
Nature had revived itself.

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:52.660 align:middle line:90%
It had not been destroyed.

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:54.150 align:middle line:90%
It had been revived.

00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:55.530 align:middle line:90%
And it was verdant.

00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:57.990 align:middle line:84%
It had a great variety of
all the herbs and plants

00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:00.349 align:middle line:84%
that we needed and could
choose where we wanted to be.

00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And what you were
saying about homes,

00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:05.970 align:middle line:84%
it was a little bubble home that
we could move where we wanted.

00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:08.210 align:middle line:84%
If you needed to be
in an environment that

00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:10.659 align:middle line:84%
was a little more moist or
needed the herbs in an area,

00:48:10.659 --> 00:48:11.700 align:middle line:90%
you could move your home.

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And remember,
with the mindwich machine,

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:15.290 align:middle line:84%
you don't worry about
the food supplies.

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:15.600 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And the
population-- by the way,

00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:18.350 align:middle line:84%
I should tell you, too, in the
future-- I've done progressions

00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:19.280 align:middle line:90%
to the 50th century.

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.290 align:middle line:90%
We're still going to be here.

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:22.890 align:middle line:84%
You have a population
of the world

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:25.160 align:middle line:84%
by the 35th century of
less than a billion people.

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why you have
one seventh the population

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:31.420 align:middle line:84%
now is not because of wars
or nuclear wars or diseases

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:33.780 align:middle line:90%
or ET attacks of the planet.

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:36.620 align:middle line:84%
It's because people just
don't have more than a couple

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:37.470 align:middle line:90%
of kids.

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:37.725 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:37.725 --> 00:48:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Most of the
population of our planet

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:41.480 align:middle line:84%
are due to third world nations
with 10 kids per family

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:41.980 align:middle line:90%
or more.

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For survival, yeah.

00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well,
they're also farmers.

00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They get guaranteed
labor for their farms.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exacty.

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:47.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But here,
the average person

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:49.360 align:middle line:84%
is gonna have maybe-- the
average family maybe two kids.

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You won't need
to have a whole lot of kids

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:52.130 align:middle line:90%
to farm the land for you.

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So we're going
to have less population,

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:54.940 align:middle line:90%
but it's quality, not quantity.

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:56.150 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
have starving people.

00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:58.108 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to have
people dying of hunger

00:48:58.108 --> 00:49:00.200 align:middle line:84%
and causing wars because
of that or terrorism

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.200 align:middle line:90%
or any of those factors.

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.640 align:middle line:90%
They're going to be all gone.

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to have a much
more positive, more spiritual

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.890 align:middle line:90%
base.

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:06.900 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to have the
paranoid governments either.

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:07.622 align:middle line:90%
You will have governments.

00:49:07.622 --> 00:49:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I
resonate with, absolutely.

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But
they're going to be

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.550 align:middle line:84%
more positive and
more altruistic.

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Working
for the people.

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --rather than
the stuff that we have now.

00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:12.331 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:49:12.331 --> 00:49:13.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's what many,
many different groups

00:49:15.390 --> 00:49:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and well-known entities have
talked about is the same thing.

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:22.770 align:middle line:84%
That yes, we're going to
go toward more one world

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:25.360 align:middle line:90%
government in the future.

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:26.806 align:middle line:90%
But it will be of the people.

00:49:26.806 --> 00:49:28.555 align:middle line:84%
It'll be responding
to the needs of what--

00:49:28.555 --> 00:49:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: It'll be democratic
and more spiritually based--

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: --rather
than the games

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:33.180 align:middle line:84%
that are being played today
with all the politics and all

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.237 align:middle line:84%
the hypocrisy, and all
the negative stuff.

00:49:35.237 --> 00:49:37.070 align:middle line:10%
Of course, you're
dealing-- See, the problem

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:39.430 align:middle line:10%
is institutions aren't so bad.

00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:40.780 align:middle line:10%
It's the people behind them.

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:43.370 align:middle line:10%
If you had very
spiritual people involved

00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:45.670 align:middle line:10%
in heads of governments
and running these things,

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:46.810 align:middle line:10%
we would have a
different organization.

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:47.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: But the problem is
when you have paranoid people

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:53.110 align:middle line:90%
with agendas and power issues--

00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:54.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The
current day status.

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Right, it's always
been that way going back

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:56.110 align:middle line:90%
to the Egyptian Mystery Schools.

00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:56.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, it has.

00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: It hasn't changed.

00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a matter
of spiritual evolution.

00:49:58.590 --> 00:49:59.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Human nature
hasn't changed in 10,000 years.

00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:02.860 align:middle line:84%
You always have a top of the
pyramid with the presidents,

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:05.910 align:middle line:84%
whatever, and then you go
down to the masses, what

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:07.640 align:middle line:90%
they call the silent majority.

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:08.840 align:middle line:90%
It's never changed.

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Think of
it in ancient Egypt.

00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:12.430 align:middle line:84%
If somebody said, I
got an idea, guys.

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:13.679 align:middle line:90%
Let's sit around the campfire.

00:50:13.679 --> 00:50:15.980 align:middle line:84%
How about I'm pharaoh, and
you guys build me a pyramid?

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:17.610 align:middle line:90%
What do you think, huh?

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:19.235 align:middle line:90%
Well, somebody did that.

00:50:19.235 --> 00:50:21.390 align:middle line:84%
They were no different
than anyone else.

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Actually, some of them
were time travelers.

00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:23.640 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about
that with Egypt.

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I know you're
familiar with Michael Cremo's

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:26.810 align:middle line:84%
work, whom I just
interviewed a week ago.

00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:28.268 align:middle line:84%
And one thing we
were talking about

00:50:28.268 --> 00:50:30.780 align:middle line:84%
is the same thing came up,
this question of what's

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:32.239 align:middle line:84%
going to happen to
us as a species?

00:50:32.239 --> 00:50:33.321 align:middle line:90%
Are we going to disappear?

00:50:33.321 --> 00:50:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to be eradicated,
blow ourselves to smithereens

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:36.750 align:middle line:90%
or whatnot?

00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if you just go
back into the Vedas themselves,

00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:41.920 align:middle line:84%
the ancient texts, we
would be approximately

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:45.310 align:middle line:84%
halfway through a particular
4 billion year cycle.

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:47.062 align:middle line:84%
So we have a couple
billion years

00:50:47.062 --> 00:50:48.770 align:middle line:84%
before we need to be
thinking about going

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:52.517 align:middle line:84%
into the sleepy stage as
a planet, as a galaxy.

00:50:52.517 --> 00:50:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well,
my progression would

00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:55.266 align:middle line:90%
have shown that, number one.

00:50:55.266 --> 00:50:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know anyone
who's worth anything who's

00:50:57.510 --> 00:51:00.206 align:middle line:84%
got any credibility who
talks about gloom and doom

00:51:00.206 --> 00:51:01.705 align:middle line:84%
beyond this century
that's relevant.

00:51:01.705 --> 00:51:02.288 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:02.288 --> 00:51:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: So understand,
people are negatively

00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:05.430 align:middle line:90%
programmed.

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:07.850 align:middle line:84%
We just had the Mayan
calendar scam thing, OK?

00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:09.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: December 21st.

00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:12.344 align:middle line:84%
That was just they ran
out of rock, you know?

00:51:12.344 --> 00:51:13.320 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the mentality.

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:14.390 align:middle line:84%
How many predictions
of the end of the world

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:15.120 align:middle line:84%
have there been,
about two dozen?

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:17.203 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it was all
misinterpreted as well.

00:51:17.203 --> 00:51:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Of course.

00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:20.003 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, I want
to get into a subject.

00:51:20.003 --> 00:51:22.310 align:middle line:84%
We've discussed
some of the beings

00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:24.770 align:middle line:84%
that people are
encountering in time travel.

00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
some of the beings

00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:29.540 align:middle line:84%
that we're encountering more
as what people would commonly

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:32.542 align:middle line:84%
refer to as a guiding
force or an angelic force.

00:51:32.542 --> 00:51:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Like spirit
guides, you mean?

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And spirit guides.

00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Sure, sure.

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And one of
them I'm curious about,

00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:38.986 align:middle line:84%
because in the writings
of them they just seem

00:51:38.986 --> 00:51:42.360 align:middle line:84%
like they're very not only
capable, but willing, able,

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and good all around,
are the Arcturians.

00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:44.796 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Oh, yes.

00:51:44.796 --> 00:51:44.920 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you talk
about the Arcturians a bit

00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:47.802 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
other species that

00:51:47.802 --> 00:51:49.510 align:middle line:84%
are helping us from
the other dimensions?

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:51.010 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well,
the Arcturians are

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:53.050 align:middle line:84%
considered to be
wise, very wise souls.

00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:54.140 align:middle line:90%
They're far beyond us.

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Remember, a spirit guide
can't work with you

00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:57.340 align:middle line:84%
unless they're more
evolved than you.

00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:00.430 align:middle line:84%
The Arcturians have been
around quite a while

00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:01.800 align:middle line:90%
helping our species.

00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:05.654 align:middle line:84%
And they are just very
pure spiritual beings

00:52:05.654 --> 00:52:06.570 align:middle line:90%
that are there for us.

00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:07.330 align:middle line:90%
Now, we can ignore them.

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.271 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: We have a
free will right here.

00:52:09.271 --> 00:52:09.880 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:14.160 align:middle line:84%
The Arcturian constellation is
about 34 light years away here.

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.010 align:middle line:84%
So they've traveled,
but remember--

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:19.090 align:middle line:84%
let me just explain-- people
say-- let me explain this, too.

00:52:19.090 --> 00:52:21.690 align:middle line:84%
How do these ETs get from
one end of the universe

00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:22.240 align:middle line:90%
to the other?

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.060 align:middle line:90%
It's always the big problem.

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:25.310 align:middle line:90%
The skeptics say, oh, come on.

00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:26.226 align:middle line:90%
All these light years?

00:52:26.226 --> 00:52:28.550 align:middle line:84%
What are going to do, hibernate
for billions of years?

00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:30.930 align:middle line:84%
There was a gentleman,
a Mexican physicist

00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:33.350 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Alcubierre,
Miguel Alcubierre.

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:35.460 align:middle line:84%
In 1994, he came up
with what's called

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:40.570 align:middle line:84%
AWD, which stands for
Alcubierre Warp Drive.

00:52:40.570 --> 00:52:42.761 align:middle line:84%
This is like Star
Trek, except it's real.

00:52:42.761 --> 00:52:44.010 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's a theoretical model.

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:44.930 align:middle line:90%
We can't do this yet.

00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:46.280 align:middle line:90%
But what he said is this.

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:49.170 align:middle line:84%
If you have a craft in what's
called the warp bubble,

00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:53.200 align:middle line:84%
and the fabric of spacetime
in front of it is contracting,

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and the fabric of spacetime
behind it is expanding,

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:58.560 align:middle line:84%
you could exceed the speed
of light and slingshot

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:00.370 align:middle line:90%
across the universe literally.

00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:04.511 align:middle line:84%
So even though it's 26, 25 light
years away from Zeta Reticuli,

00:53:04.511 --> 00:53:06.260 align:middle line:84%
they could come here
in a matter of weeks.

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:06.843 align:middle line:90%
Not a problem.

00:53:06.843 --> 00:53:09.724 align:middle line:84%
Arcturians, again, they're
about the same distance,

00:53:09.724 --> 00:53:10.640 align:middle line:90%
a little farther away.

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:11.520 align:middle line:90%
They can come here.

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:12.645 align:middle line:90%
But they're very spiritual.

00:53:12.645 --> 00:53:14.120 align:middle line:90%
Now, another group--

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:15.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to say,
how do you recognize them?

00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, they
will identify themselves.

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:17.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:18.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: They
don't wear badges.

00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:19.580 align:middle line:90%
They don't have an ID card.

00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:21.288 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I mean,
I'm just wondering.

00:53:21.288 --> 00:53:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Some have a very specific kind
of an energetic thumbprint,

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:24.540 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And they can
also present themselves

00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:27.380 align:middle line:90%
any way you feel comfortable.

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:29.671 align:middle line:84%
Because most of them-- like
a shape shifting mentality.

00:53:29.671 --> 00:53:31.840 align:middle line:84%
The Andromedans are even
better, because they're

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:33.190 align:middle line:90%
ascended spirits.

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:35.170 align:middle line:90%
They're absolutely perfect.

00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:37.320 align:middle line:84%
They are just like
Buddha complex.

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.100 align:middle line:90%
They're done.

00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:39.390 align:middle line:90%
But they help us.

00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:40.810 align:middle line:84%
The Arcturians
are more relevant.

00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:42.620 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadians are
also pretty positive.

00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And there are
other spirit guides

00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:45.710 align:middle line:90%
that help us that are not--

00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:47.650 align:middle line:84%
See, a spirit guide,
by definition,

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:51.040 align:middle line:84%
is a being that was on-- had
a life in the human form,

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:53.060 align:middle line:84%
or whatever form they
had, could be an ET,

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:54.500 align:middle line:84%
and then has
crossed into spirit.

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:56.240 align:middle line:84%
So they're in
between life phases.

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:59.312 align:middle line:84%
So they're not-- they're astral
matter but not physical matter.

00:53:59.312 --> 00:54:00.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:02.216 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And so
those are spirit guides.

00:54:02.216 --> 00:54:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Angels, of course,
are different.

00:54:03.590 --> 00:54:05.840 align:middle line:84%
They come from directly
from the God energy complex.

00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:07.290 align:middle line:84%
So they're perfect
beings from day one.

00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:08.206 align:middle line:90%
They were never human.

00:54:08.206 --> 00:54:09.990 align:middle line:90%
Where spirit guides were human.

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:11.430 align:middle line:84%
You may have known a spirit
guide in a past life.

00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:13.846 align:middle line:84%
And now they're above you, but
now they're helping you out

00:54:13.846 --> 00:54:15.470 align:middle line:90%
and more spiritually evolved.

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:17.320 align:middle line:84%
But the Arcturians,
like the Andromedans,

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:18.670 align:middle line:90%
they're actual beings.

00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:19.840 align:middle line:90%
They actually are beings.

00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.090 align:middle line:90%
But they're extremely evolved.

00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And an experience with
them will leave you

00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:27.130 align:middle line:84%
just well off, better
off than you ever

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:29.521 align:middle line:84%
were before in any
experience you've ever had.

00:54:29.521 --> 00:54:31.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And my
understanding, too,

00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:33.730 align:middle line:84%
is that oftentimes there's a
commitment between souls, where

00:54:33.730 --> 00:54:36.070 align:middle line:84%
these beings will stay with
you lifetime after lifetime

00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:36.430 align:middle line:90%
after lifetime.

00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: Sure.

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:37.790 align:middle line:84%
Just like the time
travelers trace you, too.

00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:54:38.110 --> 00:54:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And
they're human beings.

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:40.170 align:middle line:90%
They're not spirit guides.

00:54:40.170 --> 00:54:41.240 align:middle line:90%
They're actual, physical beings.

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.360 align:middle line:84%
By the way, let me
make a point here, too,

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:43.485 align:middle line:90%
to show you the difference.

00:54:43.485 --> 00:54:45.630 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult for
someone to differentiate.

00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:47.950 align:middle line:10%
How do I know that the spirit
guide that connected me

00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:49.610 align:middle line:10%
with my dream levels
or helped me out

00:54:49.610 --> 00:54:52.030 align:middle line:10%
was either Arcturian,
was it my higher self,

00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:53.780 align:middle line:10%
or was it a time
traveler from our future?

00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:55.010 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And that
is a big question.

00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:55.310 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:54:55.310 --> 00:54:56.120 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: And you
don't know at first.

00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:56.400 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:57.020 align:middle line:10%
>>GOLDBERG: Because
time travelers,

00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:59.270 align:middle line:10%
because they travel through
the fifth dimension, which

00:54:59.270 --> 00:55:00.880 align:middle line:10%
is invisible us,
guess what they do?

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.927 align:middle line:84%
They interact with us
during our dream levels

00:55:02.927 --> 00:55:05.260 align:middle line:84%
when they're not going to be
traced by the Men in Black.

00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:07.150 align:middle line:84%
They can't trace them
in the fifth dimension.

00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:08.297 align:middle line:90%
And they can help you out.

00:55:08.297 --> 00:55:09.630 align:middle line:90%
Here's an interesting statistic.

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Over 80% of major
scientific breakthroughs

00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:13.980 align:middle line:84%
have been done by
scientists who said

00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:15.397 align:middle line:84%
they got it in
their dream levels.

00:55:15.397 --> 00:55:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Most
artistic achievements,

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:20.820 align:middle line:84%
the great portraits,
the great sculpting,

00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:22.820 align:middle line:84%
and other forms of
writing, et cetera

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.800 align:middle line:84%
have been done by
people who will tell you

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:26.516 align:middle line:84%
they did it-- Robert
Louis Stevenson,

00:55:26.516 --> 00:55:28.515 align:middle line:84%
many other authors will
tell you, I had a dream.

00:55:28.515 --> 00:55:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: I had the
brownies, you know,

00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:31.360 align:middle line:90%
when he wrote his famous novels.

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Especially in
the world of science.

00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: And art, too.

00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:36.300 align:middle line:84%
So my point is that what
a time traveler can do

00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:38.190 align:middle line:84%
is interact with you
in your dream levels.

00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you one quick little
story about modern medicine

00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.900 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Modern medicine would not exist
if it wasn't for pharmacology.

00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Pharmacology is based
upon biochemistry.

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Biochemistry is based
upon organic chemistry.

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Organic chemistry is based
upon the benzine ring.

00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:54.366 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
about that in 1850.

00:55:54.366 --> 00:55:55.740 align:middle line:84%
They knew that
there was benzene.

00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:57.340 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't get the structure.

00:55:57.340 --> 00:55:59.772 align:middle line:84%
So one German scientist,
he was a chemist,

00:55:59.772 --> 00:56:01.230 align:middle line:84%
he was in his
laboratory in Bavaria

00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:03.130 align:middle line:84%
like in February
in the wintertime.

00:56:03.130 --> 00:56:05.190 align:middle line:90%
And his name was Kekule.

00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And one day he fell asleep
at his Bunsen burner

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:09.770 align:middle line:84%
and had a dream in which
he was walking down

00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:11.810 align:middle line:84%
the park in May, a
nice beautiful day.

00:56:11.810 --> 00:56:14.022 align:middle line:84%
And a giant serpent
was chasing him.

00:56:14.022 --> 00:56:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And he's huffing and
puffing and running.

00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And the serpent's getting
closer and closer.

00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:18.208 align:middle line:90%
And he sees the shadow.

00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:20.200 align:middle line:84%
Finally, he turns around,
the serpent's right

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:23.220 align:middle line:84%
above him, bites
its own tail, drops

00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:26.530 align:middle line:84%
dead right in front
of him forming a ring.

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Kekule gets the Nobel
Prize in chemistry

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:32.210 align:middle line:84%
for dissecting-- or
establishing benzine

00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:34.440 align:middle line:84%
as the basis of organic
chemistry, which

00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:35.910 align:middle line:90%
leads up to modern medicine.

00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:37.480 align:middle line:90%
He got it in the dream levels.

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.024 align:middle line:90%
>>GOLDBERG: What a coincidence.

00:56:40.024 --> 00:56:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I read a couple books
about the various people

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:44.715 align:middle line:84%
throughout history
as well who've

00:56:44.715 --> 00:56:46.340 align:middle line:84%
gotten their information
in dream time.

00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And also in alpha state just
sitting on a bus, spaced out.

00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And boom, there it is as
soon as the mind is relaxed.

00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And they can be
communicating that way, too.

00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Because once you're
in alpha-- remember,

00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:54.708 align:middle line:90%
dreams are alpha brain waves.

00:56:54.708 --> 00:56:56.030 align:middle line:90%
You're out of the body, yes.

00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:56.780 align:middle line:90%
It's more extreme.

00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:58.946 align:middle line:84%
But you're in a hypnotic
level when you're dreaming.

00:56:58.946 --> 00:56:59.810 align:middle line:90%
You're not asleep.

00:56:59.810 --> 00:57:01.210 align:middle line:84%
You're actually awake
when you're dreaming.

00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about-- we only

00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:03.810 align:middle line:90%
have a couple minutes left.

00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how
a person can actively

00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:10.350 align:middle line:84%
go about-- proactively go
about creating a relationship

00:57:10.350 --> 00:57:12.604 align:middle line:84%
with either their higher
self or their spirit guides.

00:57:12.604 --> 00:57:14.270 align:middle line:84%
I know that you talk
about this and have

00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:15.916 align:middle line:90%
fabulous exercises in your book.

00:57:15.916 --> 00:57:18.040 align:middle line:84%
But just a little tease,
a little thumbnail sketch.

00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:20.285 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Well, think of
it if they just simply sit in

00:57:20.285 --> 00:57:22.076 align:middle line:84%
a relaxed, comfortable
position or lie down

00:57:22.076 --> 00:57:23.307 align:middle line:90%
on a bed or a couch.

00:57:23.307 --> 00:57:24.640 align:middle line:90%
Don't have anything distracting.

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Don't have any incense
burning or any kind of smells.

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:29.036 align:middle line:90%
Keep it very neutral.

00:57:29.036 --> 00:57:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And then just surround
yourself with a white light,

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:31.950 align:middle line:90%
protect yourself.

00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:32.870 align:middle line:90%
OK, right?

00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:35.769 align:middle line:84%
And then simply just
send out the request.

00:57:35.769 --> 00:57:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to take
a couple of deep breaths

00:57:37.810 --> 00:57:39.460 align:middle line:90%
and neutralize your breathing.

00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Count backwards from, say,
10 to 1 to relax yourself.

00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And you'll actually be in
a light level of hypnosis.

00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're going to
send a request out.

00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:48.540 align:middle line:84%
I would like to meet
with my higher self.

00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:50.040 align:middle line:90%
And you have a specific issue.

00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:51.540 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to work
on a certain issue.

00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:54.570 align:middle line:84%
I want to increase my
abundance, meet a soul mate,

00:57:54.570 --> 00:57:57.460 align:middle line:84%
overcome an issue, a
medical issue, whatever,

00:57:57.460 --> 00:57:59.000 align:middle line:90%
any kind of goal that you have.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.620 align:middle line:84%
Just one at a time,
don't go crazy.

00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Because it won't work if
you try to be greedy here.

00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And then just
simply say I request

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:10.860 align:middle line:84%
an audience with my higher self
in my dream levels tonight.

00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to have some
conscious memories of that

00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:14.740 align:middle line:90%
when I awaken.

00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Do that several times
on a daily basis.

00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:18.900 align:middle line:84%
You're going to relax
yourself, number one.

00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And now you're activating
the higher self.

00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:23.475 align:middle line:84%
And you're more likely to go
to the upper astral rather than

00:58:23.475 --> 00:58:25.469 align:middle line:84%
the lower astral
especially at night.

00:58:25.469 --> 00:58:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, one thing for your
audience, very important.

00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Half an hour before
going to bed is critical.

00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:30.860 align:middle line:84%
No matter what you
do during the day,

00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:33.068 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if you fight
with your corporate people,

00:58:33.068 --> 00:58:34.670 align:middle line:90%
your husband, wives, kids.

00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Never do that half an
hour before going to bed.

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:37.675 align:middle line:90%
Read poetry.

00:58:37.675 --> 00:58:38.300 align:middle line:90%
Read something.

00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:39.054 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Put yourself
in a lower frequency.

00:58:39.054 --> 00:58:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Put
new age music on.

00:58:39.810 --> 00:58:40.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You don't want that.

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:41.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Just do
something positive.

00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:42.200 align:middle line:90%
Read something positive.

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:43.116 align:middle line:90%
Don't put the news on.

00:58:43.116 --> 00:58:43.680 align:middle line:90%
Forget that.

00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:44.679 align:middle line:90%
Don't deal with that.

00:58:44.679 --> 00:58:46.720 align:middle line:84%
Just something positive,
read something positive,

00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:49.760 align:middle line:84%
spiritual or just put some
music on, like new age music,

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:50.260 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:52.423 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: Whatever
your favorite music is.

00:58:52.423 --> 00:58:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Not rock music with
all the-- not rap.

00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:54.660 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:56.631 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And then
do that a half an hour

00:58:56.631 --> 00:58:58.580 align:middle line:84%
before going to bed
with these instructions,

00:58:58.580 --> 00:58:59.610 align:middle line:90%
and then go to sleep.

00:58:59.610 --> 00:59:01.440 align:middle line:84%
If you do that, you're
more likely to go

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:03.204 align:middle line:84%
to the upper astral
not the lower.

00:59:03.204 --> 00:59:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Makes total sense.

00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:07.220 align:middle line:84%
You're in a nice bath of a nice,
clear frequently, instead of

00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:07.510 align:middle line:90%
lower gunky stuff.

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:08.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GOLDBERG: And you'll leave
through the higher chakras,

00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:09.860 align:middle line:90%
preferably the crown chakra.

00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely
wonderful talking

00:59:11.790 --> 00:59:14.295 align:middle line:84%
with you, just
thoroughly fascinating.

00:59:14.295 --> 00:59:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Bruce and I are going to
continue our conversation,

00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:18.280 align:middle line:84%
focusing on distant
recollections

00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:20.490 align:middle line:84%
of our distant,
distant past including

00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:22.765 align:middle line:84%
life in Egypt,
Atlantis, and Lemuria.

00:59:22.765 --> 00:59:25.140 align:middle line:10%
