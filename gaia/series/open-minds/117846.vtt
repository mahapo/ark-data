[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.070 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
What if everything

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.530 align:middle line:10%
you thought you
knew about health

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.369 align:middle line:10%
was absolutely backwards?

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.600 align:middle line:10%
And what if I were to tell
you that our burgeoning

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.600 align:middle line:10%
rates of obesity, diabetes,
cancer, and infertility

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.980 align:middle line:10%
were more about light than food?

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jack Kruse, a
neurosurgeon by trade,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.650 align:middle line:84%
has scaled these issues
down to the quantum

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.762 align:middle line:84%
level of how light and frequency
behave in the human body.

00:00:49.762 --> 00:00:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And this isn't your
ordinary story.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to warn you
right now, everybody.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Get a pen, get some paper,
hit the pause button now.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.439 align:middle line:84%
So you have that, because this
is very information saturated.

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going to
want to miss any of this.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.040 align:middle line:84%
This is life
changing information.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.000 align:middle line:84%
So with that, OK,
hopefully, you've

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.730 align:middle line:84%
hit the Play button
again and here we are.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.500 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, you are the most
colorfully dressed guest

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.320 align:middle line:84%
I think I've ever
had on this show.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>JACK KRUSE: Oh, you've
got to go with what you are.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.391 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Purple, why purple?

00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:20.640 align:middle line:10%
>>KRUSE: Well, purple happens
to be the solar spectrum

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.230 align:middle line:10%
of hydrogen. And one of
the things that I found

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.960 align:middle line:10%
10 years ago that was important
in reversing my problem

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:10%
was I had to biohack the
periodic table of elements.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.620 align:middle line:10%
The first periodic
element is hydrogen.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Hydrogen is known
as the chameleon.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.040 align:middle line:84%
It is able to change any
atom on the periodic table

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.800 align:middle line:84%
to allow it to do things
that it needs to do.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you understand
fundamentally what life is

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.255 align:middle line:84%
and what evolution
is, it's about change,

00:01:47.255 --> 00:01:50.550 align:middle line:84%
it's about adaptation,
it's about transformation.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So once you understand
how life uses it,

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.830 align:middle line:84%
it becomes extremely important
and coherent to the message

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.230 align:middle line:84%
that I'm giving people
because that's who I am now.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So purple
is representative

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:05.620 align:middle line:90%
of transformation.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.681 align:middle line:84%
And even if you go
into ancient texts,

00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:09.680 align:middle line:84%
and you go through the
chakra system, of course,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:84%
once you get to
purple violet, you're

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.580 align:middle line:84%
into the areas of
transformation.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: True, but it also
scales all the way down

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.430 align:middle line:90%
to the quantum level.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Because purples,
blues, and violets

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.690 align:middle line:84%
have a very special
physical meaning.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.430 align:middle line:84%
It actually is able to make
light bend much more frequently

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.520 align:middle line:84%
under the force of
gravity and turns out

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.760 align:middle line:84%
that life uses that
in extreme detail

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.977 align:middle line:84%
to set the atomic
clock in your head.

00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now we're
already like five levels

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.130 align:middle line:90%
down the rabbit hole.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.739 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with
letting people know

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.030 align:middle line:90%
a little bit about who you are.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Because, at one point,
you weren't so svelte

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.602 align:middle line:84%
and you had some
health problems.

00:02:45.602 --> 00:02:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Yeah, I
mean, 10 years ago, I

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.170 align:middle line:84%
was giving a spine talk
in Birmingham, Alabama,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.820 align:middle line:84%
on minimally invasive
spine surgery

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.550 align:middle line:90%
to a bunch of my colleagues.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And I stood up at a
podium to give the speech

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.950 align:middle line:84%
and I got a horrible
pain in my right leg.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what the problem was.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Turns out I had torn my knee
meniscus just by standing up.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And as a physician,
by trade, I was

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.460 align:middle line:84%
like how could this
possibly happen

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.834 align:middle line:84%
with me not being on the
ski slopes or this and that.

00:03:09.834 --> 00:03:11.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you
were overweight.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Oh, yeah, I was
357 pounds at the time,

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.060 align:middle line:84%
but, back then,
in that reality, I

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.740 align:middle line:84%
didn't believe that that was a
major issue because I was still

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.100 align:middle line:90%
pretty young.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
orthopedic surgeons

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.950 align:middle line:84%
who was in the
audience had a wife

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.150 align:middle line:84%
who worked for Amgen.
And she said to me, look,

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.080 align:middle line:84%
my husband says you're
a pretty smart guy.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.510 align:middle line:84%
She goes I'd like to send
you a book and six papers.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to specifically
read them in this order

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.800 align:middle line:84%
and I think I can
help you understand

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.570 align:middle line:90%
why this happened to you.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.280 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, I
thought it was woo-woo.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.370 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.839 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're not prone
toward woo, as you call it.

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Well, let's
put it this way.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.680 align:middle line:84%
10 years ago, I was
a big time skeptic

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.130 align:middle line:90%
of pretty much everything.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was
trained conventionally.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.159 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Medical model, yeah.

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Exactly, that's
where I came from.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.530 align:middle line:84%
So, to my shock,
about a week later,

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.870 align:middle line:84%
I get a book in the mail called
"The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari"

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.170 align:middle line:90%
by Robin Sharma.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.904 align:middle line:90%
And it's a fable.

00:04:06.904 --> 00:04:07.820 align:middle line:90%
It's not a true story.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.861 align:middle line:84%
And she was adamant about
reading the book first,

00:04:09.861 --> 00:04:10.860 align:middle line:90%
so I did.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Then she gave me the
six papers and told me

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.670 align:middle line:84%
you need to read these
in specific order.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.170 align:middle line:84%
So, for those of you who
don't know about the book,

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.839 align:middle line:84%
it's a very interesting
book about a lawyer named

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Julian Battle who's probably
the most famous attorney in New

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.360 align:middle line:90%
York City at the time.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.580 align:middle line:84%
He has a heart attack
in the middle of a trial

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.180 align:middle line:84%
and realizes that
he almost died.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.790 align:middle line:90%
He had to change his life.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.130 align:middle line:84%
So he basically sold
everything, went up

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.220 align:middle line:84%
to the top of the
Himalayan mountains,

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.400 align:middle line:84%
and came back 25
years younger, totally

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.440 align:middle line:90%
changed his outlook on life.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And as I read this whole
book, I kept going through it.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, this
is a great story.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was a nice
book, a short read.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.070 align:middle line:90%
Then I read the first paper.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:90%
I read the second paper.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And it dawned on me
after the second paper,

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.240 align:middle line:84%
I said, wait a minute, is
it possible that what's

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.510 align:middle line:90%
in this fable is actually true.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.120 align:middle line:90%
Could we actually do this?

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.564 align:middle line:84%
So then I read the third
paper, the fourth paper,

00:05:11.564 --> 00:05:12.230 align:middle line:90%
the fifth paper.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, all
of these rabbit holes

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.160 align:middle line:90%
started to open up to me.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I learned
about a hormone called leptin.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that this lady had

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.650 align:middle line:84%
been a biotechnologist that
worked on synthetic leptin

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.390 align:middle line:90%
trials.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And for those people
who don't know,

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.130 align:middle line:84%
leptin is the master
hormone of the body

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.760 align:middle line:90%
that's secreted by fat cells.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's in a part of your
brain called the hypothalamus.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Leptin basically works
on circadian biology.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.750 align:middle line:84%
That's a term that's tied to
light and dark cycles, night

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.610 align:middle line:90%
and day.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.800 align:middle line:84%
As I went further and further
down this rabbit hole,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.290 align:middle line:84%
I started to realize that all
the things that I had been

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.440 align:middle line:84%
taught in medical school,
and what I had told patients,

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.460 align:middle line:84%
that you need to exercise more
and eat less in order to be fit

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.330 align:middle line:84%
turned out that it was
completely backwards.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now,
let's get to-- let's

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.490 align:middle line:84%
get to the kinky little
place in this story that

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.640 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the David
statue in Florence.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: After I had gone
through the rabbit hole of all

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.900 align:middle line:84%
the papers, I spent
about 18 months

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.770 align:middle line:84%
in the Vanderbilt
medical school library

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.420 align:middle line:84%
reading on all
these rabbit holes

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:84%
and seeing all these
different ties.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And when I grew up in
New York City as a kid,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:84%
I spent a lot of time in the
Museum of Natural History.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.820 align:middle line:84%
So I always had a lot
of scientific facts.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.350 align:middle line:84%
I happened to be on a family
vacation with my family

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:84%
and I told my wife that one of
the things on my bucket list

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.000 align:middle line:84%
that I had to see was
Michelangelo's David

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.200 align:middle line:90%
for specific reasons.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.817 align:middle line:84%
But when I was in the museum,
the interesting thing happened.

00:06:50.817 --> 00:06:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was standing in
front of David looking at him,

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.120 align:middle line:84%
and I was standing behind
him looking at his behind,

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.260 align:middle line:84%
and it happened
by happen chance.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.410 align:middle line:84%
I looked up at him and
I said how can that

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.860 align:middle line:90%
be perfection 500 years ago.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.343 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking at my fat ass--

00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Looking at your butt.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.690 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: You know--

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:08.606 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:07:08.606 --> 00:07:11.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is one of the most
gloriously inspiring sights

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.786 align:middle line:90%
in the world, David's rear end.

00:07:13.786 --> 00:07:15.660 align:middle line:84%
That was my favorite
view of the statue, too.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: But it wasn't mine.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.580 align:middle line:84%
What happened to me
was a spark of insight.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: I happened to look
up, and above David's head,

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.270 align:middle line:90%
there's a ledge.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.710 align:middle line:90%
And on that ledge was a bird.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw the bird and I
saw David, I said, you know,

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.540 align:middle line:84%
what's the difference
between perfection and me.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.900 align:middle line:90%
And it dawned on me.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.180 align:middle line:84%
The environment
that he lived in was

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.089 align:middle line:84%
completely different than
the one that I lived in.

00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Then I thought about
it further and I

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.540 align:middle line:90%
said there's a bird up there.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.340 align:middle line:84%
What do a bird and
man have in common?

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.070 align:middle line:84%
They have huge
mitochondrial density.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.570 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Bird needs to fly
long distances when

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.456 align:middle line:90%
it's disconnected from earth.

00:07:53.456 --> 00:07:54.740 align:middle line:90%
Why does man have it?

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Because its brain
allows it to disconnect

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.730 align:middle line:84%
from the natural
cycles on earth.

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.690 align:middle line:84%
One of those natural
key things, I

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.500 align:middle line:84%
call them the
three legged stool,

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.100 align:middle line:90%
what's the three legged stool?

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.840 align:middle line:90%
Light, water, and magnetism.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.190 align:middle line:90%
And how did I pick up on that?

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Those six papers led me
down those rabbit holes.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.470 align:middle line:84%
All that time that I had
spent in the Vanderbilt

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.410 align:middle line:84%
medical school library
brought me down there.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Every single point
that I went down

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.160 align:middle line:84%
brought me back to one
of those three schools.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And then the interesting
thing happened.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.510 align:middle line:84%
I started to realize that
NASA, any place it looked

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:33.630 align:middle line:84%
for life in the cosmos, always
used the same three principles.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.500 align:middle line:84%
When I started to
realize this, then it

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.240 align:middle line:90%
opened up some other channels.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.950 align:middle line:84%
I started to look far outside
the boundaries of science

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.409 align:middle line:84%
that I was classically
trained in.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:46.780 align:middle line:84%
I started to teach
myself cosmology.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.280 align:middle line:90%
I started to look at geology.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.310 align:middle line:84%
I started to look at
quantized ecosystems.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.380 align:middle line:84%
But the key ones
was quantum physics,

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.610 align:middle line:90%
because what did I realize?

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.600 align:middle line:84%
The key thing that
happened to me in Florence

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.970 align:middle line:84%
was I realized this was a
story about mitochondria.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And what do birds and
men have in common?

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.380 align:middle line:84%
We have huge
mitochondrial density.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.309 align:middle line:84%
Here was the interesting
part of the story.

00:09:07.309 --> 00:09:08.975 align:middle line:84%
If you know anything
about mitochondria,

00:09:08.975 --> 00:09:12.310 align:middle line:84%
they're the power
plant of the cell.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:13.200 align:middle line:90%
What's the input?

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Electrons.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.930 align:middle line:84%
What's the output
from cytochromes?

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Protons.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:21.410 align:middle line:84%
See, most people believe in
my profession that being well

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.392 align:middle line:90%
is about food.

00:09:22.392 --> 00:09:23.850 align:middle line:84%
But, see, what
people don't realize

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.940 align:middle line:84%
is that all foods get
broken down to what?

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.540 align:middle line:90%
Electrons.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And, see, to understand the
input of mitochondria you

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.780 align:middle line:90%
have to understand electrons.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.420 align:middle line:84%
I did not understand
a lot about electrons.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.520 align:middle line:84%
On the back of every
electron is a photon,

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.500 align:middle line:90%
which is a light beam.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.420 align:middle line:90%
And I knew even less about that.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.340 align:middle line:84%
That's when I'd realized
I had to go and learn

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.260 align:middle line:84%
a lot more about
quantum physics.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.060 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I did.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And the more I
learned, the more I

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.900 align:middle line:84%
realized that we truly
are beings of light.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.830 align:middle line:90%
We are not what we think we are.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.870 align:middle line:84%
There's been tons of
research done on this topic.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.500 align:middle line:84%
The problem is it's not
tied to Western science.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.510 align:middle line:84%
The reason why those things were
disconnected were world wars.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Most of this research
was done in Russia.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:17.810 align:middle line:84%
I actually had to go
back and translate papers

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.740 align:middle line:84%
from Russian into English
in order to understand it.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.280 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
do that these days

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.182 align:middle line:84%
because now there's books
written about all those papers.

00:10:28.182 --> 00:10:29.640 align:middle line:84%
I did the same
thing when it came--

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they understood
these principles long before--

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:33.784 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: 1923.

00:10:33.784 --> 00:10:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: That was a gentleman
named Alexander Gurwitsch.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.700 align:middle line:84%
In 1923, the seminal
research that

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:45.620 align:middle line:84%
showed that all life emits
extreme low frequency UV light.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
signal, what he called

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:52.629 align:middle line:84%
mutagenic radiations, that's the
signal to tell cells to divide.

00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing
that he found, and this

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:59.330 align:middle line:84%
is very interesting, when he put
a piece of glass between-- he

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:00.390 align:middle line:90%
used two onions.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.360 align:middle line:84%
He cut the bottom
off of one onion

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.770 align:middle line:84%
to stimulate cell
division in the other one.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:07.670 align:middle line:84%
When he put a piece of glass
between them, it didn't work.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.660 align:middle line:84%
When he put a piece of
quartz, like this right

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.350 align:middle line:90%
here, between them, it worked.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.950 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Because UVB light
is blocked by glass,

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.170 align:middle line:90%
it's not blocked by quartz.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And that told me,
right there, when

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:23.560 align:middle line:84%
I read that, that this
was a quantized process.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.750 align:middle line:84%
In other words, anything
dealing with light and electrons

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.230 align:middle line:90%
is not biologic.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.820 align:middle line:84%
It's quantum mechanics,
quantum physics.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I didn't
know enough about that.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:34.980 align:middle line:90%
So what did I do?

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.890 align:middle line:90%
I jumped down that rabbit hole.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And, literally,
in medical school,

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:43.110 align:middle line:84%
in residency, in training, I had
absolutely no training outside

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.955 align:middle line:90%
of basic physics.

00:11:43.955 --> 00:11:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: So after putting
myself through all this,

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:53.890 align:middle line:84%
I began to realize on the
flight home from Michelangelo

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.600 align:middle line:90%
that I had a new perspective.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So, literally, from
Charles de Gaulle Airport

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.860 align:middle line:84%
to Chicago, which is
where the flight was,

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I took every Delta napkin
and started writing down

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.630 align:middle line:90%
this quilt document.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.400 align:middle line:90%
And I put 30 different levies.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And you know, me,
from New Orleans,

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:10.500 align:middle line:84%
we call levees something
that protects the city.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.450 align:middle line:84%
So I came up with the idea to
protect our cells in our body.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.200 align:middle line:90%
And I started to order them.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And you can go on my
blog now and find,

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:90%
it's called the quilt document.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:23.195 align:middle line:84%
I wrote this in 14 hours
on a plane going home.

00:12:23.195 --> 00:12:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On napkins.

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:24.903 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: On napkins.

00:12:24.903 --> 00:12:27.030 align:middle line:84%
I still actually have
the napkins at home.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And when I got home, I
actually wrote it down.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And my wife, to this day,
still remembers the trip

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.017 align:middle line:84%
because she's like
you were in a zone.

00:12:35.017 --> 00:12:37.350 align:middle line:84%
It was clear that something
was going through your head.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.150 align:middle line:84%
But I had-- I didn't tell
anybody about what I was doing.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And I came up with
this document.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Then I started to go home and
put different prescriptions

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.160 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.680 align:middle line:84%
I started to realize
that I could fix myself

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.280 align:middle line:84%
if I use circadian biology
to alter my environment.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.220 align:middle line:84%
I realized that there was
another answer out there.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:58.199 align:middle line:84%
And after going through
all this process, what

00:12:58.199 --> 00:12:58.990 align:middle line:90%
did I come up with?

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:03.770 align:middle line:84%
I found that I could eat more
and exercise less, do exactly

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:06.530 align:middle line:84%
opposite what I was
taught in medical school.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And my hypothesis,
or what I like

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.300 align:middle line:84%
to call as my biohack
or my n equals one

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.490 align:middle line:90%
was to put this to the test.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Because, like any
good scientist,

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.260 align:middle line:84%
you can come up
with a good idea,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.860 align:middle line:84%
but if you don't have any
experience or experiments

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.780 align:middle line:84%
to back it up, a
theory's just a dream.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: And that's all it is.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.570 align:middle line:84%
So I went home, and
I did just that.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.320 align:middle line:84%
I came up with something
called the Leptin

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Prescription and the Cold
Thermogenesis Protocol.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Leptin Prescription basically
is a synonym for light.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:84%
What is Cold Thermogenesis
a synonym for?

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.470 align:middle line:90%
Cold, or magnetism.

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:41.180 align:middle line:90%
Those were the two keys.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:45.655 align:middle line:84%
So I went back home, and, in
three months, I lost 77 pounds.

00:13:45.655 --> 00:13:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Whoa.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: And in 11
months, I lost 133 pounds.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And my wife would come in and
watch me shrink every day.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, there was times, especially
when I was in surgery,

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:84%
because when I'm in surgery,
I'm around really bad

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.920 align:middle line:84%
light, like you and
I are right now.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: We're sitting
in the middle of--

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Unhealthy,
unnatural light.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:05.419 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:05.419 --> 00:14:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: And those things
really put me at risk

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.310 align:middle line:90%
during my day job.

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:13.190 align:middle line:84%
So I realize those days, I had
to mitigate my risks higher.

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:14.560 align:middle line:90%
So I packed myself in ice.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's an
extreme, but realizing

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.450 align:middle line:84%
that my environment
that I placed myself

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:24.730 align:middle line:84%
in as a neurosurgeon in the
operating room is also extreme.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So before we move
on deeper into that subject,

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.030 align:middle line:84%
and to the case of a woman that
we talked about off camera,

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.820 align:middle line:84%
which sounds just amazing, very
similar to the story you're

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.290 align:middle line:90%
talking about with you.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:39.109 align:middle line:84%
What exactly-- people,
by this time, are saying,

00:14:39.109 --> 00:14:40.150 align:middle line:90%
OK, I have my pencil out.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.250 align:middle line:84%
What did he do to
make that happen?

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.890 align:middle line:84%
So just give us a sketch,
without going even

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.180 align:middle line:84%
into the science at this
point, of what it required

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.350 align:middle line:84%
you to do to get back
into the circadian rhythm

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:54.820 align:middle line:84%
and do things correctly by
what you had just studied

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.330 align:middle line:90%
at the library and so forth.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:56.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: Well, you--

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What had you learned?

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.101 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: It's actually
pretty simple.

00:14:59.101 --> 00:15:02.550 align:middle line:84%
I came up with a prescription
called my Leptin Prescription.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:04.180 align:middle line:90%
You can find it on my blog.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Six steps, but here's
the gist of it.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Soon as you wake up
early in the morning,

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:11.700 align:middle line:84%
you need to go outside and
let the sun hit your retina.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.200 align:middle line:84%
You can't have
glasses on, you can't

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:90%
have a window in front of you.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And you have to eat a very
large protein breakfast

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.270 align:middle line:90%
within 30 minutes of rising.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's key.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the connection
between taking the sun directly

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:28.700 align:middle line:84%
into your eye, meaning it
should be early in the morning,

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.250 align:middle line:84%
or you have to look through
your eyelashes at the sun?

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: Well, if-- it depends--

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or just
for a second or two?

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: It depends on
your local environment.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.990 align:middle line:84%
If you're a shift worker,
you've got a problem.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, OK, so let's just
say we're not shift workers.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.660 align:middle line:84%
We're getting up, we
can look in the sun

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.190 align:middle line:84%
for however many seconds
before it burns our retina.

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:45.230 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Well, you
don't need to do it.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.813 align:middle line:84%
Early in the morning,
you're not going

00:15:46.813 --> 00:15:49.490 align:middle line:84%
have a problem with that because
the sun's angle of inclination

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:50.940 align:middle line:90%
is weak.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.480 align:middle line:84%
You're looking just to set
the atomic clock in your head

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.460 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.460 align:middle line:90%
Because you have to reset it.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Then eating protein actually
resets the atomic clocks

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.326 align:middle line:90%
in your gut.

00:16:01.326 --> 00:16:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And what you're trying
to do is you're trying

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.645 align:middle line:90%
to get them yoked together.

00:16:04.645 --> 00:16:07.722 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this one
has to meet this one.

00:16:07.722 --> 00:16:08.930 align:middle line:90%
And you consistently do that.

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And what you find over four
to six weeks, what's the key?

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Anybody that's been
overweight knows

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.720 align:middle line:84%
that they tend to
have hunger, they

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.850 align:middle line:84%
tend to crave carbohydrates,
and things like that.

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:20.675 align:middle line:84%
Within six weeks, that goes
away when you use this process.

00:16:20.675 --> 00:16:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's-- we're going
to break it down a little bit.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.966 align:middle line:84%
When you say eat
protein in the morning,

00:16:24.966 --> 00:16:27.450 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about
fish in a little while, but--

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Well, you
don't have to use fish.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.618 align:middle line:84%
So I was going to
say, what can you

00:16:30.618 --> 00:16:32.910 align:middle line:84%
have besides oysters
for breakfast here?

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:33.815 align:middle line:90%
Just any good solid--

00:16:33.815 --> 00:16:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: Eggs.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Protein like eggs.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Well, you
can use eggs, bacon.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:37.955 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: You know, sausage.

00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:39.288 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kind of classic paleo.

00:16:39.288 --> 00:16:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Well, I think people
would call it paleo Atkins,

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't call it that because,
really, truly, what you're

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.100 align:middle line:84%
trying to do is you're
using protein as a tool.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And that protein
is trying to give

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.637 align:middle line:90%
a message to your microbiome.

00:16:51.637 --> 00:16:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now I have
another question.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.720 align:middle line:84%
We'll have some
people watching this

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:84%
who are vegans or
vegetarians, but more vegans,

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.150 align:middle line:84%
let's say, where
they don't eat eggs.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: Yeah.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.590 align:middle line:90%
They got a big problem.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:05.605 align:middle line:84%
And this goes to the point
that I made to you earlier,

00:17:05.605 --> 00:17:08.480 align:middle line:84%
that I can lead you to the water
but I can't make you drink.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.510 align:middle line:84%
See, here's the beautiful thing
about evolution and science.

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.980 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to have a
belief about something,

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.540 align:middle line:84%
but if it's not
accurate, then you're

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.200 align:middle line:84%
not going to have
the outcome you want.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Vegans can do this,
because I've got

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.150 align:middle line:90%
several vegans in my community.

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What do they
use for their proteins?

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:25.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: They're
using whey protein.

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so that'll help.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: And a lot
of them are what

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I would call not
hardcore vegans,

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:34.410 align:middle line:84%
so that they'll use
eggs to their advantage.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:36.900 align:middle line:84%
But it can be done,
but here's the problem.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:41.060 align:middle line:84%
The rate of assimilation,
the rate of change is slower.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And it also-- usually people who
are vegan, who are vegetarians,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.199 align:middle line:90%
have lower redox potentials.

00:17:46.199 --> 00:17:47.490 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean in English?

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.840 align:middle line:84%
It means that the battery
that drives our biochemistry

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.720 align:middle line:90%
is lower.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.780 align:middle line:84%
So just like a car, if
a car has a bad battery,

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.310 align:middle line:84%
the key may start the car,
but the horn and the lights

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:56.880 align:middle line:90%
may not work.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:90%
The peripheral systems are off.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know, I mean I was
a vegetarian for almost 20 years

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:07.230 align:middle line:84%
for philosophical purposes,
and my horns and lights

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:08.600 align:middle line:90%
weren't working at all.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I was
on my way out actually.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.530 align:middle line:84%
I could tell my systems
were shutting down.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And then, one day, a little
meditation and vision, and it

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.290 align:middle line:84%
showed me a medium rare steak
and a glass of red wine,

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:22.710 align:middle line:90%
and I cried, but I ate it.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And I started actually
getting better immediately.

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Well, this is
the counterintuitive part.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.540 align:middle line:84%
People, especially
humans, we are

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.070 align:middle line:84%
the one animal on
this planet that

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.110 align:middle line:90%
can create our own reality.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.730 align:middle line:84%
We don't realize that we're
creatures to our beliefs.

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And my job as a physician
is not to tell you

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:41.830 align:middle line:90%
how to live your life.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.630 align:middle line:84%
My job is to tell
you what I found.

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And through this whole
evolutionary biology story,

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.670 align:middle line:84%
it brought me back to
the smallest level.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you
a very quick story

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:52.950 align:middle line:84%
about how important
this is to me

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.979 align:middle line:90%
from a neurosurgery perspective.

00:18:54.979 --> 00:18:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Probably the most
famous neurosurgeon

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.950 align:middle line:84%
in the 20th century was a
guy named Gazi Yasargil.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:03.290 align:middle line:84%
What did he do that made
him so incredibly powerful?

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:05.290 align:middle line:84%
He brought the
operating microscope

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:08.160 align:middle line:90%
into the operating field.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.810 align:middle line:84%
That allowed us to
see smaller scale,

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:12.870 align:middle line:84%
so that we could do better jobs
with AVMs, aneurysms, and brain

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:13.650 align:middle line:90%
tumors.

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:14.700 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing?

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.500 align:middle line:90%
Exactly the same.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking you from biochemical
levels down to quantum levels,

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.920 align:middle line:90%
to electrons and protons.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell
you fundamentally

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.800 align:middle line:84%
that the electrons that are in a
vegan diet or a vegetarian diet

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:30.320 align:middle line:84%
are radically different than
the ones in a DHA seafood based

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.310 align:middle line:84%
diet, then I'm going to explain
to you why it's different.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Then you're faced with
the beautiful opportunity

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.620 align:middle line:84%
that quantum physics gives
you is changing your reality.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.560 align:middle line:84%
How do you change your
reality as a human?

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.006 align:middle line:90%
You change your mind.

00:19:43.006 --> 00:19:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.900 align:middle line:84%
So now let's get back to
these few points with you,

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll go to the woman
named Kate Towers who you've

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.780 align:middle line:90%
worked with and her family.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.790 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about-- you
look into the sun for however

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:59.152 align:middle line:84%
many seconds you comfortably
can do that to reset this--

00:19:59.152 --> 00:20:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: It doesn't
take that much.

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:01.730 align:middle line:90%
You can do for 30 seconds.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And then you have,
within 30 minutes--

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: A large-- we
call it the big ass

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:07.900 align:middle line:90%
breakfast on the site.

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Protein breakfast.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.134 align:middle line:90%
Then what happens after that?

00:20:11.134 --> 00:20:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Well, those
are the key things.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.950 align:middle line:84%
There's other things
that go with it,

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.532 align:middle line:90%
but those are the two big keys.

00:20:15.532 --> 00:20:17.740 align:middle line:84%
What you want to do is do
that for four to six weeks.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Once the key signal is--
sweating tends to change,

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.590 align:middle line:84%
but the big one is
cravings go away.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And see when obese people
see cravings go away,

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:28.560 align:middle line:90%
they're kind of shocked.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Most people who are
listening to this

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.247 align:middle line:84%
will not believe that
happens, but it does.

00:20:33.247 --> 00:20:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, because they've
been a slave to the cravings.

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: Correct.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is they don't
realize that light drives

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:39.199 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:20:39.199 --> 00:20:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And to get into the details a
little bit more, why does light

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:43.740 align:middle line:90%
do that?

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Light controls another
atom in us called nitrogen.

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And this process in us
is called ubiquitination.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Light and nitrogen
control carbon flows.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:54.610 align:middle line:90%
So what did I just say there?

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:56.050 align:middle line:90%
Sleight of hand.

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Light and nitrogen
together control food.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.850 align:middle line:84%
See, we have the
fundamental belief

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:05.020 align:middle line:84%
that food is the primary
driver of both epigenetics,

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.214 align:middle line:90%
meaning our environment.

00:21:06.214 --> 00:21:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.296 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: We have
that in medicine,

00:21:08.296 --> 00:21:10.350 align:middle line:84%
ancestral health,
the paleo community,

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:84%
just about every
alternative community.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.736 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying,
that's not true.

00:21:14.736 --> 00:21:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And all you have to do to
see to see that I'm right

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.510 align:middle line:84%
is open up any book
or read anything

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:23.600 align:middle line:84%
from PubMed that tells you
that ubiquitin, meaning

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.440 align:middle line:84%
it's ubiquitous in
plants and animals,

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:30.700 align:middle line:84%
is a process that's driven
by light on nitrogen.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And why should this be
important, both for carnivores

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.210 align:middle line:90%
and for vegetarians?

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that chlorophyll
is got a magnesium

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.950 align:middle line:84%
ion in the middle surrounded
by four nitrogens?

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that plasma
in your blood, hemoglobin,

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.500 align:middle line:90%
has four nitrogens around iron.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Every place you find
life in any kingdom,

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.330 align:middle line:84%
you have nitrogen
around a metal.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:53.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's the key.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is we are now
coming to the point in biology

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.370 align:middle line:84%
where we're beginning to
realize that ubiquitin

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:04.690 align:middle line:84%
and what it does to proteins is
the key driver for epigenetics.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:06.700 align:middle line:84%
The problem is
that information's

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.740 align:middle line:84%
being published in
research, but it's not

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.164 align:middle line:90%
hit clinical medicine yet.

00:22:10.164 --> 00:22:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.163 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: And the point that
I'm trying to make to people

00:22:13.163 --> 00:22:15.026 align:middle line:84%
is when they try my
Leptin Prescription,

00:22:15.026 --> 00:22:16.900 align:middle line:84%
I didn't tell this to
people when I posted it

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.790 align:middle line:84%
on the internet five
to seven years ago,

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:22.320 align:middle line:90%
but it's a light driven process.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:84%
After the six weeks, when
the cravings went away,

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.100 align:middle line:90%
what did I do?

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.660 align:middle line:90%
Then I added the magnetism side.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.270 align:middle line:84%
How do you increase magnetism
in anything on this planet?

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:33.860 align:middle line:90%
Physics told me the answer.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.140 align:middle line:90%
It's called Curie point.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.770 align:middle line:84%
The Curie point shows that
any time things get colder,

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:38.800 align:middle line:90%
it gets more magnetic.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.247 align:middle line:84%
Any time the temperature
rises, it gets less magnetic.

00:22:42.247 --> 00:22:44.205 align:middle line:84%
Well, what does your
mitochondria fundamentally

00:22:44.205 --> 00:22:45.200 align:middle line:90%
act as?

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.210 align:middle line:90%
A tiny nano electromagnet.

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:50.580 align:middle line:84%
If you increase a magnet's
strength, what do you do?

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.560 align:middle line:90%
You increase energy.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So what was my belief at that
original biohack that I did?

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.960 align:middle line:84%
If I could increase energy flows
from light and from magnetism,

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.800 align:middle line:90%
I could decrease my mass.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.412 align:middle line:84%
Now did I believe
that it would work?

00:23:04.412 --> 00:23:05.620 align:middle line:90%
I'll be very honest with you.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.080 align:middle line:90%
I didn't think it would.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:10.960 align:middle line:84%
But in 11 months, I became
a very small person.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And everybody in my
hospital was asking me,

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Jack, did you go out and
have surgery on this--

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
your stomach stapled?

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: Exactly.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know,
I'm a neurosurgeon.

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:19.525 align:middle line:90%
I'm always operating.

00:23:19.525 --> 00:23:22.860 align:middle line:84%
I said did I have any time
off to do any of this.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:25.204 align:middle line:84%
So there was a couple
of docs in my hospital

00:23:25.204 --> 00:23:26.870 align:middle line:84%
that were very really
interested in this

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:28.700 align:middle line:84%
and they started to
send me cases that

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.890 align:middle line:90%
were not neurosurgery based.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:33.360 align:middle line:84%
One of the docs in particular
was a gastroenterologist.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, Jack,
what you're doing is amazing.

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:38.754 align:middle line:84%
He said you need to put this
information on the internet.

00:23:38.754 --> 00:23:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be honest with
you, in the beginning,

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:43.540 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel
comfortable doing that.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And then I decided,
OK, I'm going

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:47.510 align:middle line:84%
to put the quilt
document up on a site

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.230 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm going to
start releasing some blogs.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And you have to realize, from my
perspective as a neurosurgeon,

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.542 align:middle line:84%
the blogs have to
be head splitting.

00:23:56.542 --> 00:23:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Like if you read
some of the blogs,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.630 align:middle line:84%
you'd be like, oh,
my god, this is--

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I have.

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: Right.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.311 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like,
oh, I have a headache.

00:24:02.311 --> 00:24:04.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm not drinking coffee
anymore, so what do I do?

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Well, the
reason why it has

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:08.710 align:middle line:84%
to be like that is because
I've got people, scientists

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:10.410 align:middle line:90%
and researchers, who read it.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:12.625 align:middle line:84%
They have to know
that this is not woo.

00:24:12.625 --> 00:24:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I totally-- I
got why you do it that way.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.425 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is it's
written in such a way there

00:24:19.425 --> 00:24:22.290 align:middle line:84%
are kind of key things that
happen in each of your blogs,

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:84%
where you-- it's
like an aha moment.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.220 align:middle line:90%
A light turns on, I get it.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:27.080 align:middle line:90%
I can put those pieces together.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.200 align:middle line:90%
As a layperson, even.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: And what I try
to do with the blogs,

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:31.440 align:middle line:90%
I also have a forum.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.025 align:middle line:84%
I answer all the questions
that you can have.

00:24:34.025 --> 00:24:35.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm active on social media.

00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:37.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
question and you're not

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.370 align:middle line:84%
sure about something,
I'll answer it.

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:42.450 align:middle line:84%
But here's the
method to my madness.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:44.040 align:middle line:90%
I came up with the quilt idea.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think ladies would
really appreciate this,

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:47.440 align:middle line:84%
because, when you
build a quilt, you

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.648 align:middle line:90%
have piece by piece by piece.

00:24:48.648 --> 00:24:51.679 align:middle line:84%
And as you build it, then you
get to see the coherent whole.

00:24:51.679 --> 00:24:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, the blogs are no
different than that.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:55.100 align:middle line:84%
It adds another
piece to the story.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.870 align:middle line:84%
So there are more pieces
you get, the more coherent

00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:58.620 align:middle line:90%
the story becomes.

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.400 align:middle line:84%
So you can say,
in the beginning,

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.047 align:middle line:84%
you may think I
was bat shit crazy,

00:25:02.047 --> 00:25:03.130 align:middle line:90%
but then you start going--

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you're
just lost because it's

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.500 align:middle line:90%
different terminology.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely different
medical model, so to speak.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.885 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Well, it's
a paradigm change.

00:25:09.885 --> 00:25:11.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's
a paradigm change.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.093 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: The way I
like to describe it

00:25:13.093 --> 00:25:14.860 align:middle line:84%
to even my patients
in the clinic,

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.526 align:middle line:84%
like you take my fist here and
you take a flashlight here.

00:25:17.526 --> 00:25:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And if I shine a
light on it, you

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:19.975 align:middle line:84%
look at the shadow
cast on the wall.

00:25:19.975 --> 00:25:20.860 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a fist.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.490 align:middle line:90%
What happens when I do this?

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:25.700 align:middle line:84%
See, the two thermodynamic
events haven't changed,

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.530 align:middle line:90%
but the shadow's different.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.264 align:middle line:84%
That is the interesting thing
that happens in biology.

00:25:30.264 --> 00:25:31.430 align:middle line:90%
It changes your perspective.

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And when your perspective
changes to a physics level,

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:38.350 align:middle line:84%
you start to look
at proteins, you

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.080 align:middle line:84%
start to look at
redox potentials,

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.390 align:middle line:90%
you start to look at cells.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:44.500 align:middle line:84%
You start to look at the way
the cells are put together

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.880 align:middle line:90%
completely differently.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And that is what really
got me on those six papers.

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Those six papers
really made me realize

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.580 align:middle line:84%
that I had to stop
thinking like a doctor

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:55.914 align:middle line:90%
and think more like an engineer.

00:25:55.914 --> 00:25:58.413 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or a physicist, even,
or a culmination of the two.

00:25:58.413 --> 00:26:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: I think an engineer
is more accurate because it's

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.170 align:middle line:90%
about thermodynamics.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now let's--
you lost your cravings.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:09.615 align:middle line:90%
Now what happened after that?

00:26:09.615 --> 00:26:10.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you lost
a lot of weight.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:12.330 align:middle line:84%
There must have been
more to this process.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.496 align:middle line:84%
You said six things, and
we're only at two or three.

00:26:14.496 --> 00:26:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Yeah, but the big
one was then adding the cold.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.594 align:middle line:84%
And the cold was like
throwing the gasoline--

00:26:19.594 --> 00:26:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you mean
like submerging yourself

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:22.140 align:middle line:90%
in cold water?

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Yeah, I started
off first with showers.

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And I found that it didn't
do enough on skin coverage.

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And then I started to look--
I told you-- in the NASA data,

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and also I started to look
at SEAL training, and things

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.070 align:middle line:90%
that the military was doing.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I
didn't have to lower

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.120 align:middle line:90%
my temperature in the core.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.705 align:middle line:84%
I just had to lower the
surface temperature.

00:26:39.705 --> 00:26:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That means you don't
have to stay in it very long.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.000 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: Mm, that's not true.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:43.821 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, God.

00:26:43.821 --> 00:26:44.320 align:middle line:90%
So how--

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Now, it depends
what your goal is.

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I was
a big, heavy man,

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:48.960 align:middle line:84%
so my goal was
maximum weight loss.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.800 align:middle line:84%
So I've actually
packed myself in ice.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.540 align:middle line:84%
There, in fact,
one night, when I

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:56.410 align:middle line:84%
came back from doing five
or six fusion operations,

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:58.880 align:middle line:84%
I packed myself in
the tub, had my wife

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:03.080 align:middle line:84%
dump 160 pounds of ice on me and
I slept for 12 hours in there.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.789 align:middle line:84%
But here's the coolest
part of the story.

00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:06.579 align:middle line:84%
And this really made
an impact on my wife--

00:27:06.579 --> 00:27:07.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No pun intended.

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:10.130 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: I lost five
pounds that night.

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:13.230 align:middle line:90%
And my wife was like wow.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:14.930 align:middle line:84%
For those of you who
are nonbelievers,

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:17.450 align:middle line:84%
this is a very interesting
story to follow.

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Mass General 2007,
2008, they came up

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.320 align:middle line:84%
with something called
cold sculpting.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:22.960 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.175 align:middle line:84%
That's plastic surgery for
ladies without a scalpel.

00:27:25.175 --> 00:27:26.466 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I've read about that.

00:27:26.466 --> 00:27:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: They take a metal
plate and put it on your fat

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.270 align:middle line:90%
and freeze it.

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And in six weeks,
the fat goes away.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Where'd they get the idea?

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:38.690 align:middle line:84%
1950 Korean War, black soldiers
were exposed, got frostbite,

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:41.540 align:middle line:84%
they started to lose all
their fat around their face.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.120 align:middle line:84%
So they got the
idea could you use

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.050 align:middle line:90%
this to do different things.

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:48.310 align:middle line:84%
So when I read
this, I went in back

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:50.760 align:middle line:84%
to all the things I had
read, and guess what I found?

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.510 align:middle line:84%
That leptin biochemistry
was tied to cold receptors

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:56.360 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the skin.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.350 align:middle line:84%
And that is where I
came up with the idea.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:01.570 align:middle line:84%
So you can pay a
plastic surgeon $2,000

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:04.000 align:middle line:84%
to do this procedure on
you or you can go and use

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.840 align:middle line:84%
my Cold Thermogenesis
Protocol in your bathroom,

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.900 align:middle line:84%
at home, for the price
of what it costs for ice.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:11.990 align:middle line:90%
And it works.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And people have been
doing this on the forum.

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:17.050 align:middle line:84%
When I started putting
my ideas out there,

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:18.591 align:middle line:84%
you know, there was
a lot of critics.

00:28:18.591 --> 00:28:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you listened
to critics, you know,

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.180 align:middle line:84%
sometimes you'll miss out
on some really good stuff.

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And one of the girls that
was on my forum, her name

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:28.940 align:middle line:90%
was Kate Towler.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.270 align:middle line:90%
She lives in Michigan.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:31.840 align:middle line:90%
And she sent a picture.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.180 align:middle line:84%
I have a part of my form that is
called Optimal Journals, where

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:40.320 align:middle line:84%
basically people put their
stories down about what brought

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.270 align:middle line:84%
them to the point they are now,
like-- I always tell people,

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:45.600 align:middle line:84%
when you get to
be sick and tired,

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.364 align:middle line:84%
that's when you're
really ripe for change,

00:28:47.364 --> 00:28:48.780 align:middle line:84%
especially if you
go to the doctor

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.610 align:middle line:84%
and they keep telling you the
same thing over and over again.

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:53.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like when Einstein said
if you do the same thing over

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.995 align:middle line:84%
and over again and expect
a different result,

00:28:54.995 --> 00:28:55.860 align:middle line:90%
that's insanity.

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And, unfortunately,
that's what I realized.

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:00.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's what Kate realized.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:02.860 align:middle line:84%
So she put her life
story on the forum.

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.360 align:middle line:90%
And it was a shocking story.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.310 align:middle line:84%
She was basically
in her late 20s.

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:10.050 align:middle line:84%
She was married to a person
with Asperger's syndrome.

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:13.220 align:middle line:84%
She had two children that
were densely autistic.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Dr. Kruse, if I
apply these principles, what

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:18.246 align:middle line:90%
could happen to me.

00:29:18.246 --> 00:29:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: She was
also very overweight.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Yes, she
was over 350 pounds.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.330 align:middle line:84%
She actually put her original
picture up on the forum.

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:27.600 align:middle line:90%
And she applied the principles.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.660 align:middle line:90%
18 months, she lost 157 pounds.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:34.350 align:middle line:84%
But the coolest part of the
story was this past September,

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:36.860 align:middle line:84%
I went to a
biohacking conference.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And I just put her
picture up and showed it.

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And I told them you guys may be
amazed about her weight loss,

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:47.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm not because she did
exactly the same thing I did.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.030 align:middle line:90%
That's not the shock.

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:51.870 align:middle line:84%
But the shock was her two kids
are no longer on the spectrum.

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:54.206 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, they followed
the protocols as well?

00:29:54.206 --> 00:29:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Oh, well, pretty much
how this works if mama does it,

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:57.745 align:middle line:90%
everybody in the house does it.

00:29:57.745 --> 00:29:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the whole
family was doing this.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Is this including the
lowering of their temperature

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:03.135 align:middle line:90%
through these cold baths?

00:30:03.135 --> 00:30:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Yes, well, the kids,
see, they live in Michigan,

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:08.030 align:middle line:84%
so they had a bigger opportunity
to use the snow in the cold.

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, yeah.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: But, yeah,
the kids did it, too.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And Kate's story evolved
in that 18 months

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.860 align:middle line:84%
on the forum and people
started to see her results.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.052 align:middle line:84%
When she sent me the kids'
data from the pediatrician,

00:30:21.052 --> 00:30:22.760 align:middle line:84%
that they were no
longer on the spectrum,

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.760 align:middle line:84%
and that even her
husband had improved,

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:30.480 align:middle line:84%
I was shocked because that's
not why I innovated this.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.430 align:middle line:84%
So when I presented this at
this biohacking conference,

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:36.190 align:middle line:84%
two movie producers
came up and said, look,

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:37.370 align:middle line:90%
we don't believe this.

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:39.240 align:middle line:84%
We'd like to go
and interview her.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.440 align:middle line:90%
So they did.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And the movie producers
just came back

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:44.706 align:middle line:90%
and met with me six weeks ago.

00:30:44.706 --> 00:30:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And here's the funny
part of the story,

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:49.040 align:middle line:84%
I've never met Kate like you
and I are meeting right now.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.530 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Kate's on
my arm right here.

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:54.620 align:middle line:84%
She made this bracelet for
me because she's a starfish.

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:57.230 align:middle line:84%
I call people that
do the things that I

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:59.230 align:middle line:84%
teach them to do starfish
because they're trying

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:01.220 align:middle line:90%
to help change other people.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And when Sarah and
Harry, who went up

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:06.800 align:middle line:84%
there to meet them,
they were like, Jack,

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.960 align:middle line:90%
this lady is just magic.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.320 align:middle line:90%
She's completely changed.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.510 align:middle line:90%
Her kids have changed.

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:13.520 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is the point that
I would make to people.

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Just thoughts can
change your DNA.

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:21.870 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not taught that.

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:23.287 align:middle line:84%
I was not taught
that in medicine.

00:31:23.287 --> 00:31:23.953 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:23.953 --> 00:31:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: To be honest with
you, until kind of Kate

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:30.770 align:middle line:84%
came into my life, I didn't
think that was the case either.

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started to
realize that when you put down

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:39.180 align:middle line:84%
thoughts that are
tied to nature, that

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:42.370 align:middle line:84%
follow some very
fundamental rules,

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:45.210 align:middle line:90%
anybody can have optimal health.

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:46.285 align:middle line:90%
It's a choice.

00:31:46.285 --> 00:31:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that
is really, I think,

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.570 align:middle line:84%
a very optimistic
aspect of your message

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:54.899 align:middle line:84%
is that you don't have to
already be in decent shape

00:31:54.899 --> 00:31:55.440 align:middle line:90%
to get going.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.440 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the more-- almost
the more desperate you are,

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.040 align:middle line:84%
the more ready for
change you are,

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.320 align:middle line:90%
the more receptive you are--

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: Correct.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:02.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
better results you get.

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: And the
other thing I would

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.321 align:middle line:84%
tell you is the more
of a skeptic you

00:32:05.321 --> 00:32:08.130 align:middle line:84%
are because no one started
this process more as a skeptic

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:08.890 align:middle line:90%
than me.

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:11.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you know
anything about medicine,

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and especially
neurosurgeons, we tend

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:16.419 align:middle line:84%
to be the most skeptical
dogmatic people on the planet.

00:32:16.419 --> 00:32:17.460 align:middle line:90%
That's how we're trained.

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:18.126 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:32:18.126 --> 00:32:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: And this completely
changed my viewpoint

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.870 align:middle line:90%
of how I look at disease.

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:26.440 align:middle line:84%
I tell people this
now, after they

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:30.000 align:middle line:84%
hear the story, that I was
taught to believe that disease

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.900 align:middle line:90%
manifests within my DNA.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:35.750 align:middle line:84%
I now know that DNA
is not the problem.

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:38.850 align:middle line:84%
The environment that we
allow our DNA to sense

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:40.850 align:middle line:90%
is the critical problem.

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:43.764 align:middle line:84%
And those things in
the environment, food

00:32:43.764 --> 00:32:45.180 align:middle line:84%
happens to be one,
but the big one

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:47.830 align:middle line:84%
is light, and then some
of the newer technologies

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:48.440 align:middle line:90%
that we allow.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.124 align:middle line:84%
For example, we've already
talked about one today

00:32:51.124 --> 00:32:52.040 align:middle line:90%
during this interview.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.595 align:middle line:84%
We're sitting around some
incredible blue light.

00:32:54.595 --> 00:32:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I want to ask
you want a couple more things

00:32:56.970 --> 00:33:00.160 align:middle line:84%
before we get into the
whole notion of light

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.430 align:middle line:84%
and RF and EMF
frequencies and all

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:05.400 align:middle line:84%
that, because, really,
that's a whole other story

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.144 align:middle line:84%
in and of itself and what
it's doing to us, isn't it?

00:33:08.144 --> 00:33:09.310 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: It's the key story.

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:10.518 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's the key story.

00:33:10.518 --> 00:33:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So before we get
to the key story,

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:14.830 align:middle line:84%
I was listening-- you
just brought up food,

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:22.130 align:middle line:84%
you brought up light, and this
holistic nature of-- maybe I

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:23.840 align:middle line:90%
shouldn't say it in reverse.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:26.650 align:middle line:84%
When I was listening to
your blog, it was going by

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:28.320 align:middle line:90%
and I was hanging in there.

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And I heard something and I
thought did I hear this right.

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:33.679 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't sure that I did,
so I asked you off camera.

00:33:33.679 --> 00:33:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And you said, no,
you heard it right.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:38.209 align:middle line:84%
And it had to do
with consuming algae.

00:33:38.209 --> 00:33:39.000 align:middle line:90%
This is a big deal.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.166 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, a lot of the
people watching this show

00:33:41.166 --> 00:33:46.240 align:middle line:84%
are consuming blue green
algaes, and very dense grasses,

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:49.950 align:middle line:84%
wheat grasses, wheat grass
powders, and so forth.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes with negative
impacts, but you

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.990 align:middle line:84%
said you should
not be separating

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:57.910 align:middle line:84%
the algae from the fish, that
uncoupling that is happening

00:33:57.910 --> 00:33:59.970 align:middle line:84%
the way we live our
lives in general,

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:02.117 align:middle line:84%
this being just a
specific example,

00:34:02.117 --> 00:34:03.075 align:middle line:90%
is part of the problem.

00:34:03.075 --> 00:34:04.930 align:middle line:90%
So can you get into that a bit?

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Yeah,
that's an easy one.

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:10.000 align:middle line:10%
You do need to know a little
science, but it's not hard.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000 align:middle line:10%
Everything in
biology is coupled,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.739 align:middle line:10%
meaning that it has
one side and the other.

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:17.139 align:middle line:84%
And the best way to think
about as a Venn diagram.

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:18.420 align:middle line:90%
Two circles come together.

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:20.330 align:middle line:90%
The overlap is what matters.

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:22.420 align:middle line:84%
The other sides don't
really matter too much.

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.840 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about algae.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Algae, in the sea, are designed
to make a chemical called DHA.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Most people know
that as fish oil.

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Fish oil has a very
specific purpose in biology.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:35.159 align:middle line:84%
It's designed to take
sunlight, turn it

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:37.340 align:middle line:84%
into a DC electric
current and vice versa.

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:40.654 align:middle line:84%
It can go from a DC electric
current back to sunlight.

00:34:40.654 --> 00:34:41.570 align:middle line:90%
Here's the key factor.

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:45.610 align:middle line:84%
DHA has never been replaced in
the kingdom of life we live in.

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:48.010 align:middle line:90%
We are part of the eukaryotes.

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:50.639 align:middle line:84%
Prokaryotes and Archaea are
the other two kingdoms of life.

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:52.070 align:middle line:90%
There's only three.

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:54.620 align:middle line:84%
600 million years, so I want
you to think about that.

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.650 align:middle line:84%
In evolutionary
time scales, it's

00:34:56.650 --> 00:35:00.120 align:middle line:84%
never been replaced one time,
yet we know from Darwin's work

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:01.760 align:middle line:90%
everything gets replaced.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.580 align:middle line:90%
But this hasn't been replaced.

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.030 align:middle line:90%
So that tells you right--

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's essential.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: That tells
you right then

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:07.470 align:middle line:84%
and there, it's
really important.

00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:08.095 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:08.095 --> 00:35:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: So algae
make DHA in the sea

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.260 align:middle line:84%
from photosynthesis,
from the sun.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.730 align:middle line:90%
Plankton have to eat the algae.

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:18.970 align:middle line:90%
Why is that stuff critical?

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Because DHA, when
it's first made,

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:23.520 align:middle line:90%
has to be in a certain position.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who knows anything
about biochemistry

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.560 align:middle line:84%
knows that all fats are
based on a carbon chain.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a three carbon chain,
one, two, and three.

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:35.170 align:middle line:84%
DHA, to be used in mammalian
tissue, specifically

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:37.820 align:middle line:84%
the brain and the heart or
the central nervous system,

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.890 align:middle line:84%
has to be in SN2 position, has
to be in the middle position.

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
that is because when

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.847 align:middle line:84%
it's in that position,
it's called paramagnetic.

00:35:45.847 --> 00:35:46.680 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.140 align:middle line:90%
It's drawn to magnetic fields.

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:52.030 align:middle line:84%
What did we say before
about mitochondria?

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:54.400 align:middle line:90%
They are nano electric magnets.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.570 align:middle line:90%
So why is DHA paramagnetic?

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Because it's drawn to
tissues with huge amounts

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:01.160 align:middle line:90%
of mitochondria.

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.820 align:middle line:84%
The reason why is because
it has to turn light

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:06.790 align:middle line:84%
into an electrical
signal and vice versa.

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:07.520 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Without algae, if
you just eat algae,

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.200 align:middle line:84%
you're not getting
DHA in the SN2.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.110 align:middle line:90%
It's in SN1 or SN3.

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:17.310 align:middle line:90%
So it's biologically not active.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
unavailable, so to speak.

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:18.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: Correct.

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:19.590 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work for us.

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:20.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But if you eat fish.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Well, because
fish eat plankton.

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:26.720 align:middle line:84%
So that means that the DHA
is in the SN2 position.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, eating
fish is the key.

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:31.572 align:middle line:84%
Now do certain fish have
higher levels of DHA--

00:36:31.572 --> 00:36:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
this because you're really

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:38.000 align:middle line:84%
big on fish consumption to
keep our DHA levels intact,

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.950 align:middle line:84%
to keep our energy systems
intact, or everything intact.

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:46.300 align:middle line:84%
So give us the rundown on the
top for really great fish,

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and then maybe
the bottom feeders

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:49.775 align:middle line:84%
that don't work so
well, figuratively.

00:36:49.775 --> 00:36:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: This is what
I would tell you.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:53.760 align:middle line:84%
I have a blog post about
this called "Brain Gut Six."

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.270 align:middle line:84%
I would tell you
to read that one.

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:57.690 align:middle line:84%
But the simple one
is the smallest fish

00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:01.380 align:middle line:84%
in the ocean that form the basis
of the food chain for big fish

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:02.460 align:middle line:90%
are sardines.

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:05.890 align:middle line:84%
They have the highest
amount of DHA in them.

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:08.520 align:middle line:84%
The other key thing is,
remember, fish all swim

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.460 align:middle line:90%
in different columns of water.

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:12.085 align:middle line:84%
You want the fish in
the coldest water.

00:37:12.085 --> 00:37:14.001 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Makes sense
from what you just said.

00:37:14.001 --> 00:37:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Right, because it
has more electrons in it.

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:17.253 align:middle line:90%
And that's the reason why.

00:37:17.253 --> 00:37:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Remember, cold
water is more dense.

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:21.590 align:middle line:90%
That's why it falls down.

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Ice is on the top, so fish
can swim underneath it.

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Mackerel happens
to be a good one.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.650 align:middle line:84%
The fish you want
to stay away from

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:29.920 align:middle line:84%
are the predator fish
at the top of the apex.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.952 align:middle line:84%
So tuna and swordfish
are the things

00:37:31.952 --> 00:37:33.160 align:middle line:90%
you'd want to stay away from.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:33.660 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Because they tend to collect
toxins from the lower ends that

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:39.970 align:middle line:84%
are not good, not that--
and I don't want anybody

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:43.140 align:middle line:84%
to think that tuna and swordfish
are not fish that you can eat.

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:46.850 align:middle line:84%
They're far better choices
than, say, eating like a rabbit

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:49.490 align:middle line:90%
or eating, say, a paleo diet.

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Because the amount of DHA even
in predator fish is very high.

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:54.440 align:middle line:90%
And you need that.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:57.160 align:middle line:90%
But the best is shellfish.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And that you're going to find
out when you read my book.

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.110 align:middle line:84%
The number one
thing, the thing that

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:05.320 align:middle line:84%
has more nutrient density
for a mammal, that

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.570 align:middle line:84%
has three pounds of DHA
in its head is an oyster.

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And just so you
know, one raw oyster

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:14.837 align:middle line:84%
is equivalent to eating one
pound of grass fed liver.

00:38:14.837 --> 00:38:15.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: And remember
why grass fed,

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:middle line:84%
this is where the paleo
guys get it right.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.324 align:middle line:90%
They stumbled in by luck.

00:38:23.324 --> 00:38:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: DHA's the key because
where's DHA on the land chain?

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.110 align:middle line:90%
It's in grass.

00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:31.610 align:middle line:84%
The problem is cows are
designed to eat grass,

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:33.330 align:middle line:84%
but they no longer
do in our country

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:35.120 align:middle line:90%
because we feed them grains.

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Grains are not good because
they're loaded with omega 6s.

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.700 align:middle line:90%
Remember, DHA is an omega 3.

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And you need that
specific omega 3

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:46.030 align:middle line:84%
in order to make signaling
everywhere in your body work

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:46.530 align:middle line:90%
correctly.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Because when signaling
doesn't work, you get bigger,

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:52.220 align:middle line:84%
or you get sicker, or you
get an autoimmune disease,

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:53.870 align:middle line:90%
or you get neuro degeneration.

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:55.860 align:middle line:84%
You wind up with
Alzheimer's disease.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:57.780 align:middle line:90%
You get Parkinson's earlier.

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Here's the key point that I want
to bring home to you about DHA.

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.837 align:middle line:90%
DHA is destroyed by blue light.

00:39:03.837 --> 00:39:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going
there right now.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.870 align:middle line:84%
But, first, I did-- people
are saying, wait a minute,

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:10.190 align:middle line:84%
wait a minute, he didn't
say anything about salmon.

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: Salmon's great.

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:13.930 align:middle line:84%
But I will tell you salmon
from different parts

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:15.420 align:middle line:90%
of the world is better.

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:18.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you can get your
hands on salmon from Alaska,

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.384 align:middle line:84%
in the cold water, the
polar seas, Norway.

00:39:21.384 --> 00:39:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:23.758 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: The thing
that you have to avoid

00:39:23.758 --> 00:39:25.630 align:middle line:84%
is you have to
avoid farmed fish.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:27.130 align:middle line:84%
But here's the key
with farmed fish,

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:28.880 align:middle line:90%
not all farm fish are bad.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm one of the few
people, especially

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:33.090 align:middle line:84%
in alternative health
communities, that will tell you

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:35.170 align:middle line:90%
that farmed stuff, I'm OK with.

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:37.899 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you live in
the Philippines or Australia,

00:39:37.899 --> 00:39:39.690 align:middle line:84%
you have to eat farmed
fish because there's

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:42.014 align:middle line:90%
no fish alive left in the sea.

00:39:42.014 --> 00:39:42.930 align:middle line:90%
So everything's there.

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:46.590 align:middle line:84%
But the key is you
are what you eat eats.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:50.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you feed them soy
pellets, you feed them corn,

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.650 align:middle line:84%
you're effectively
eating chicken.

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:53.790 align:middle line:90%
You're not eating fish.

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:56.230 align:middle line:84%
It's still called salmon,
but it's not really salmon

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:58.170 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
have DHA in it.

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:00.827 align:middle line:84%
Now some of the
foreign producers,

00:40:00.827 --> 00:40:02.910 align:middle line:84%
especially the guys that
I know down in Australia,

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:07.540 align:middle line:84%
are using algae and
plankton to feed the fish.

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Then that farmed
fish is quite good.

00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:10.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
makes sense, sure.

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: So you need to realize.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.616 align:middle line:84%
Here, in the States,
we're a little bit lucky.

00:40:13.616 --> 00:40:16.319 align:middle line:84%
Depending on where you are,
down where I am in the Gulf,

00:40:16.319 --> 00:40:17.110 align:middle line:90%
I have no problems.

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:18.740 align:middle line:90%
All the fish is wild.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:19.581 align:middle line:90%
The fish there is--

00:40:19.581 --> 00:40:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But it's warm water.

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Yeah, but
here's the irony.

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:25.517 align:middle line:84%
There's a story that goes
back to the quantum physics,

00:40:25.517 --> 00:40:27.100 align:middle line:84%
something you and I
didn't talk about,

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:29.460 align:middle line:84%
that I think you'll
find interesting.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Warm water tends to
have-- it's a dead zone.

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:36.610 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the equatorial
waters around the planet,

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:39.320 align:middle line:84%
fish don't really
populate there.

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:42.120 align:middle line:84%
The highest density, the biomass
of fish, are in the poles

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:42.870 align:middle line:90%
where it's colder.

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:45.293 align:middle line:84%
Because there's more
electrons in the water,

00:40:45.293 --> 00:40:46.860 align:middle line:84%
there's more oxygen
in the water.

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Makes sense.

00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Why is the Gulf
of Mexico different?

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:51.889 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So prolific?

00:40:51.889 --> 00:40:52.430 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: Why?

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean--

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:56.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: What happened there
65 million years ago when

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.220 align:middle line:90%
the age of mammals began?

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:01.910 align:middle line:84%
An asteroid hit the planet
and created a giant crater

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:04.620 align:middle line:90%
in the ground 166 miles wide.

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:06.910 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
Chicxulub crater.

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:10.990 align:middle line:84%
That brings the surface
magma, magnetism.

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:12.210 align:middle line:90%
Guess why.

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:12.810 align:middle line:90%
Guess why.

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is in the last
chapter of my book.

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:17.680 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason
why the Gulf of Mexico

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:21.580 align:middle line:84%
is teeming with life,
because the magnetic field is

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:25.980 align:middle line:84%
more powerful there than in any
other place around the planet.

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:29.420 align:middle line:84%
This is the interesting
part about physics.

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, I tell people
this all the time.

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:33.355 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we talked earlier
about the three legged stool.

00:41:33.355 --> 00:41:35.584 align:middle line:84%
We talked about light,
water, and magnetism.

00:41:35.584 --> 00:41:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you how important
it is to understand that you

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.860 align:middle line:90%
have to have all three parts.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.830 align:middle line:84%
If you go outside
tonight and look up,

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:43.540 align:middle line:84%
no matter where you
are, you're going

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:45.040 align:middle line:84%
to see our nearest
neighbor is Mars.

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:47.514 align:middle line:84%
It has light, it has
frozen polar caps.

00:41:47.514 --> 00:41:48.555 align:middle line:90%
But what doesn't it have?

00:41:48.555 --> 00:41:50.330 align:middle line:90%
It has no magnetic field.

00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:53.066 align:middle line:90%
It's a dead red desert.

00:41:53.066 --> 00:41:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Two out of three was
good for meatloaf,

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:56.760 align:middle line:90%
but it's not good for life.

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.550 align:middle line:90%
We need all.

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And on our planet,
you need to realize

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:06.720 align:middle line:84%
that the place where you need to
supplement your battery, that's

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:09.700 align:middle line:84%
inside you, I call it the
mammalian battery, when

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.630 align:middle line:84%
you live a
disconnected life, you

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:14.030 align:middle line:84%
have to have more
DHA in your battery.

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:18.170 align:middle line:84%
When you live more like a
plant, say, around the equator,

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:20.464 align:middle line:84%
you can live off more of
the photosynthetic side

00:42:20.464 --> 00:42:22.880 align:middle line:84%
of the battery, which is tied
to water chemistry, which we

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.290 align:middle line:90%
haven't talked that much about.

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Most people know photosynthesis
takes thin air, co2,

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:30.310 align:middle line:90%
with light and forms sugars.

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:33.820 align:middle line:84%
You have the availability to
do that partially in your body,

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.420 align:middle line:84%
but we supplement it with
DHA on the other side.

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's equivalent
to something we

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:42.920 align:middle line:84%
have talked about off camera is
about the John Deere tractor.

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.890 align:middle line:84%
When you have a car
battery and you put the key

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:49.380 align:middle line:84%
in all the time, the key
starts-- say, for 40 years,

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:50.370 align:middle line:90%
today, it didn't start.

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:50.880 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do?

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:53.000 align:middle line:84%
You go out and pull the
battery out and look in,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:53.900 align:middle line:90%
pull the top off.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:55.817 align:middle line:84%
And say, oh, there's no
water, I'm dehydrated.

00:42:55.817 --> 00:42:57.566 align:middle line:84%
So you pour some water
in, put the key in,

00:42:57.566 --> 00:42:58.500 align:middle line:90%
it still doesn't work.

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Then you say, OK,
what's the problem.

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's the cell
in the battery.

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:04.954 align:middle line:84%
So you call your boyfriend
up, you jump the battery.

00:43:04.954 --> 00:43:05.870 align:middle line:90%
It still doesn't work.

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Now you're left
with a conundrum.

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:08.623 align:middle line:90%
What's the conundrum?

00:43:08.623 --> 00:43:10.740 align:middle line:84%
The conundrum is, is the
battery truly dead or is

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:12.930 align:middle line:90%
it just need to be charged.

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:14.636 align:middle line:90%
So you take it to Firestone.

00:43:14.636 --> 00:43:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Take it Firestone, find
out it's dead or not.

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:18.470 align:middle line:90%
Well, you got lucky.

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:20.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do I do
this clinically?

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:22.140 align:middle line:84%
First thing I do, is
if we could do this,

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:23.556 align:middle line:84%
we probably can't
do it on camera,

00:43:23.556 --> 00:43:25.130 align:middle line:90%
but I would grab your tibia.

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:26.500 align:middle line:90%
Why your tibia?

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:29.550 align:middle line:84%
The bone comes closest
to the surface.

00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:31.042 align:middle line:90%
And I squeeze it with my finger.

00:43:31.042 --> 00:43:31.750 align:middle line:90%
Why do I do that?

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:34.675 align:middle line:84%
I want to see if
your bone is soft.

00:43:34.675 --> 00:43:36.300 align:middle line:84%
If I can't do it with
my finger, then I

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.340 align:middle line:84%
take my reflex hammer
and push against it.

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.150 align:middle line:84%
It's called a tibial
compression test.

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Why do I do that?

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Because it tells me if you're
vitamin D status is low.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:46.910 align:middle line:90%
What is vitamin D correlated to?

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, how are you
designed to make it?

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:49.726 align:middle line:90%
From sunlight.

00:43:49.726 --> 00:43:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:52.092 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: You're not designed
to take it by a pill, which

00:43:52.092 --> 00:43:52.950 align:middle line:90%
is what your doctors give you.

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:53.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: That tells me that
your DC electric current is bad.

00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.540 align:middle line:90%
How did I know that?

00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:00.260 align:middle line:84%
What is the cell
in your battery?

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:00.940 align:middle line:90%
DHA.

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:02.010 align:middle line:90%
What did we say earlier?

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:04.935 align:middle line:84%
It turns sunlight into
a DC electric current.

00:44:04.935 --> 00:44:06.980 align:middle line:84%
So if I know your bone's
soft, I know which

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:09.180 align:middle line:90%
side of your battery's bad.

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:10.510 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And the key is, then that
brings us to the key point,

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:17.160 align:middle line:90%
why is DHA destroyed.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, now, I mean,
we could talk for a few

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:23.050 align:middle line:84%
more hours just on any
one of these topics,

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:25.420 align:middle line:84%
but, again, these
blogs are available.

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:29.740 align:middle line:84%
You have a book available,
"The Leptin Prescription Diet."

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:31.900 align:middle line:90%
You can read on the site.

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:34.950 align:middle line:84%
So let's just say we've given
people enough information

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:36.610 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
real basics, which

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:40.250 align:middle line:84%
is the sunlight, heavy dense
protein breakfast, also

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:43.150 align:middle line:84%
lowering your body temperature
for a sustained period of time

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:46.180 align:middle line:84%
depending on how severe your
condition, and so forth.

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
more beyond that.

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.550 align:middle line:90%
So now what destroys this?

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Now we go into the things we're
doing to our own environment

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:55.110 align:middle line:84%
to essentially cause us
to have to do all of this.

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Right, well, one of
the great things about having

00:44:57.650 --> 00:45:00.900 align:middle line:84%
a human brain is that it were
able to do things that other

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:01.530 align:middle line:90%
animals aren't.

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is the point that I
like to bring up to most people

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:06.630 align:middle line:90%
when I talk to them.

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to ask you
to do this on camera.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.930 align:middle line:84%
I want you to close
your eyes for me.

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:13.305 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to imagine that
you're in Yellowstone Park

00:45:13.305 --> 00:45:16.250 align:middle line:84%
and it's December 31st,
and you're a wolf.

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:18.100 align:middle line:84%
You notice that
you're foraging for--

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm hungry.

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:19.275 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: Right.

00:45:19.275 --> 00:45:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And you're really hungry and
you're foraging for food.

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:25.037 align:middle line:84%
You're the thinnest that you've
ever been in your entire life

00:45:25.037 --> 00:45:26.620 align:middle line:84%
because you're hungry
and you're cold.

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:28.117 align:middle line:84%
Now I want you to
open your eyes.

00:45:28.117 --> 00:45:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Now you're in Southern
California, where you live.

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:31.590 align:middle line:90%
Now you're a human.

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Why is it in the newspapers,
at this very same time,

00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:38.100 align:middle line:84%
December 31, you see nothing
but articles for Gold's Gym.

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that you and
that wolf are both mammals,

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:46.790 align:middle line:84%
but you have to work out at the
time when he's the thinnest?

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:48.390 align:middle line:90%
Why is that mismatch there?

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:51.500 align:middle line:84%
You know why, you're the only
mammal on this planet that

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.990 align:middle line:90%
can control its environment.

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: And guess what?

00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:57.790 align:middle line:90%
Therein lies the problem.

00:45:57.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is modern
humans don't realize the degree

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:02.890 align:middle line:90%
that they control it.

00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:07.110 align:middle line:84%
What's the number-- I call
this the electromagnetic fields

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:08.200 align:middle line:90%
that we allow.

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.590 align:middle line:90%
We have native fields.

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:12.040 align:middle line:84%
The native fields is what
we've been talking about.

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.790 align:middle line:84%
It's about the earth's
magnetic field.

00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:17.630 align:middle line:84%
It's about 50
microteslas normally.

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
sun, day and night.

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Those are
electromagnetic fields.

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:26.760 align:middle line:84%
That's what our biology
was designed around.

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:30.450 align:middle line:84%
The problem is now we
have non-native fields.

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:32.112 align:middle line:84%
What's the first
non-native field?

00:46:32.112 --> 00:46:33.570 align:middle line:84%
I shared this one
with you already.

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:35.200 align:middle line:84%
When you were born, you
came through a vagina.

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Electricity and light.

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: No, you came
through a vagina.

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:39.230 align:middle line:90%
Did you have clothes on?

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Both of us have
clothes on today.

00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:43.890 align:middle line:84%
So the first mismatch
that we made as a species

00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:45.640 align:middle line:90%
was 700,000 years ago.

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:47.890 align:middle line:84%
The last humans that lived
the way they're supposed to

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:49.050 align:middle line:90%
is the American Indians.

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:50.230 align:middle line:90%
What'd they have on?

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.770 align:middle line:90%
Loin cloths?

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:52.710 align:middle line:90%
Expose themselves all the time.

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:54.365 align:middle line:90%
Their solar panel was up.

00:46:54.365 --> 00:46:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Today, we have the belief
that the sun is bad

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:59.509 align:middle line:84%
which is actually almost
comical when you understand--

00:46:59.509 --> 00:47:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:01.341 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: Evolution.

00:47:01.341 --> 00:47:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I never
bought that one.

00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:05.740 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: What's the other key?

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:08.880 align:middle line:84%
In our houses, we all
have electric cabling.

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:10.790 align:middle line:90%
It runs on 60 Hertz.

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:12.580 align:middle line:84%
People don't believe
that has an effect.

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:15.380 align:middle line:84%
I would tell everybody
listening to this interview,

00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going to get into
the details, I promise you,

00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:21.770 align:middle line:84%
this book will
cover everything you

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:25.560 align:middle line:84%
need to know about non-native
electromagnetic fields.

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:30.220 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Going Somewhere,"
by Dr. Andrew Marino.

00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And this person is one
of the people, papers,

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:38.160 align:middle line:84%
that I read of those six
papers that I told you about.

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:40.530 align:middle line:84%
Turns out that he's got a
book that basically takes

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:43.480 align:middle line:84%
all of the papers that I
read, with a key researcher

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:46.670 align:middle line:84%
named Dr. Robert O. Becker,
who just about every doctor

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:48.560 align:middle line:84%
knows, especially if
you're in my business,

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:51.370 align:middle line:84%
because he figured out
how bone physiology works.

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:54.800 align:middle line:84%
He was an orthopedic
surgeon at SUNY Syracuse.

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And he realized that
bone regeneration

00:47:57.730 --> 00:48:02.940 align:middle line:84%
occurs by semi conduction in
all mammals, including us.

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And it is very
counterintuitive for doctors

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:09.370 align:middle line:84%
to realize that semi
conduction works on us.

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:11.277 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Say that in
English for laypeople.

00:48:11.277 --> 00:48:12.110 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:12.940 align:middle line:90%
The implication of it.

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.023 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: It's very simple.

00:48:14.023 --> 00:48:16.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, let's talk about
some of the older people that

00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:17.110 align:middle line:90%
are probably watching this.

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:18.970 align:middle line:84%
They used to have
an analog telephone.

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:20.580 align:middle line:84%
Today, everybody
has a cell phone.

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:22.960 align:middle line:90%
The cell phone works on a chip.

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Your computers, the cameras
running this interview,

00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:27.490 align:middle line:90%
all run on chips.

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Those chips work on a specific
type of electrical current.

00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:34.064 align:middle line:84%
There is a difference between
the electricity in the wall

00:48:34.064 --> 00:48:35.230 align:middle line:90%
and that electrical current.

00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:36.146 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference?

00:48:36.146 --> 00:48:38.930 align:middle line:84%
The electricity in your
battery or in the wall

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:40.230 align:middle line:90%
doesn't work well in cold.

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:42.100 align:middle line:84%
But guess what happens
in semi conduction?

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:44.050 align:middle line:90%
It works phenomenal.

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Why did packing
myself in ice work?

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:48.990 align:middle line:84%
You can do the biohacking
yourself at home.

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Take your iPhone, put it on
the hood of your Mercedes.

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:53.682 align:middle line:84%
In the summer, you'll get
a temperature warning.

00:48:53.682 --> 00:48:55.640 align:middle line:84%
Take the phone and put
it right in the freezer,

00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:58.190 align:middle line:84%
and guess what happens,
it works like a charm.

00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:59.280 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.590 align:middle line:84%
This is the counterintuitive
part of physics.

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:04.360 align:middle line:84%
You need to understand that
not all electric currents are

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:05.660 align:middle line:90%
created equal.

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And the one that's
in us is a big deal.

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Marino's book, called "Going
Somewhere," is key reading.

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:16.620 align:middle line:84%
When you realize that non-native
electromagnetic fields have

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:21.240 align:middle line:84%
tremendous implications on
signaling in our body, they do,

00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.200 align:middle line:90%
and what's the major effect?

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Not to get too deep into
the science, it's simple.

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Calcium, everybody's
heard of that.

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Calcium acts as a cement
in your cell membranes.

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Basically, it
allows calcium to go

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:35.520 align:middle line:90%
and the cell membranes unwind.

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.720 align:middle line:84%
What do cell membranes
do in our body?

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:42.050 align:middle line:84%
They're electromagnetic antennas
for sunlight and magnetism.

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:44.850 align:middle line:90%
That is how biology works.

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And when you can't keep
that cement in there,

00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:49.050 align:middle line:90%
can you get the signal?

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:50.010 align:middle line:90%
Just think about it.

00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:52.940 align:middle line:84%
When you were a young lady
driving in Southern California

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and used to have AM radio,
remember when you drove

00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:57.410 align:middle line:84%
under a power line,
you heard that-- that's

00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:59.810 align:middle line:84%
exactly what happens when
you're in a non-native field

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:03.690 align:middle line:84%
to your mitochondria, inside
you or in your cell membranes.

00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And when you have too
much, guess what happens?

00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:09.120 align:middle line:84%
You get sick and
you get diseases

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:11.720 align:middle line:84%
that come out of
nowhere, like autism,

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.390 align:middle line:90%
like autoimmune diseases.

00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:16.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'll give
you a perfect example

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:18.490 align:middle line:84%
that I've shared
with many doctors.

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:20.430 align:middle line:84%
If you look at my
Robin's pathology book

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:22.780 align:middle line:84%
when I was in medical
school in 1986,

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:24.560 align:middle line:84%
talked about
Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:26.586 align:middle line:84%
It was less than 1%
of cases in women--

00:50:26.586 --> 00:50:27.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, God,
it's epidemic.

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: Now it's 90% to 95%.

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:33.680 align:middle line:84%
So my profession says, well,
it's got to be genetic.

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you know
anything about genetics,

00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:38.610 align:middle line:84%
genetics can't change
in 30 years that fast.

00:50:38.610 --> 00:50:42.670 align:middle line:84%
It's clearly epigenetic, just
on that one disease alone.

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is, for
autoimmune diseases, at least

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:47.020 align:middle line:84%
from conventional
medicine, we still

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:48.920 align:middle line:84%
don't have a good
answer for that.

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:51.470 align:middle line:84%
So instead, then we
have alternative health

00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:56.350 align:middle line:84%
practitioners who make things
up to try to fit the story.

00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:59.090 align:middle line:84%
I get angry about this,
just as well as I get angry

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:00.810 align:middle line:90%
about conventional medicine.

00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:02.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't want people
to believe woo.

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:04.160 align:middle line:90%
I want people to understand.

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.610 align:middle line:90%
There is a reason for this.

00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:07.720 align:middle line:90%
And the reason is a quantum one.

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:11.590 align:middle line:84%
It's tied to the way we
handle electrons and protons

00:51:11.590 --> 00:51:14.340 align:middle line:84%
in mitochondrion and in on our
cell membranes for signaling.

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:17.785 align:middle line:84%
When signaling breaks down,
it's like that little game

00:51:17.785 --> 00:51:19.160 align:middle line:84%
that you played
probably when you

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.230 align:middle line:90%
were younger called telephone.

00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:22.730 align:middle line:84%
You get on and
you say something,

00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:24.900 align:middle line:84%
you get to the end of 30
people, and the message

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:26.420 align:middle line:90%
comes out completely different.

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's fundamentally
what cancer is.

00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:32.270 align:middle line:84%
When that message goes from
the cell membrane all the way

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:34.270 align:middle line:84%
to the mitochondria
deep in the cell,

00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:37.360 align:middle line:84%
the message isn't the
same as it was from light

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.140 align:middle line:90%
or from the magnetic field.

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.724 align:middle line:90%
It's radically different.

00:51:40.724 --> 00:51:41.390 align:middle line:90%
So what happens?

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:43.074 align:middle line:90%
Biochemistry alters.

00:51:43.074 --> 00:51:44.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is as a result of all

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:46.640 align:middle line:90%
these artificial intrusions?

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: Correct.

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:49.691 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that includes
light, artificial light.

00:51:49.691 --> 00:51:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: Light's the biggest--

00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:53.505 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
this light and blue light.

00:51:53.505 --> 00:51:55.088 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Blue light's
the biggest one.

00:51:55.088 --> 00:51:58.091 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why, how do
you explain this simply, let's

00:51:58.091 --> 00:52:00.340 align:middle line:84%
build on the concepts that
we've already talked about.

00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:03.260 align:middle line:84%
We talked about how
incredibly important DHA

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:07.400 align:middle line:84%
is to eukaryotic kingdom,
which is mammals are.

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.915 align:middle line:84%
600 million years, blue
light destroys DHA.

00:52:10.915 --> 00:52:15.390 align:middle line:84%
DHA in your eye has
higher concentration

00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:16.680 align:middle line:90%
than it is in your brain.

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:18.000 align:middle line:90%
Many people don't know that.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.320 align:middle line:90%
That's by evolutionary design.

00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:20.140 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:21.760 align:middle line:84%
What is your eye
designed to see?

00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:23.420 align:middle line:90%
Light, right?

00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:24.790 align:middle line:90%
So blue light destroys it.

00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:26.880 align:middle line:84%
When DHA gets destroyed,
it gets broken down

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:29.810 align:middle line:84%
into three chemicals, resolvins,
protectin, and maresins.

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Not important you
remember it, just

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.890 align:middle line:84%
realize that those
chemicals are antioxidants.

00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:36.520 align:middle line:90%
They help us.

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:40.705 align:middle line:84%
But you have to replace the DHA
after the blue light comes in.

00:52:40.705 --> 00:52:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't eat it,
you can't replace it.

00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:43.200 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Humans have left less
than a 1% ability

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:48.860 align:middle line:90%
to regenerate DHA endogenously.

00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:50.400 align:middle line:90%
So we have to eat it.

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
to consume it, yeah.

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: And you have
to eat it consistently.

00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:55.230 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a
modern human and you

00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:57.200 align:middle line:84%
live in Southern
California, and you're

00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:00.790 align:middle line:84%
around lights like this all day,
or you're a neurosurgeon back

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:04.790 align:middle line:84%
in New Orleans, and you're
around electromagnetic fields

00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:08.340 align:middle line:84%
from x-ray machines, and
blue lights, and microscopes,

00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:09.800 align:middle line:90%
what might that effect be?

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.570 align:middle line:84%
You destroy DHA
slowly in your body.

00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:12.800 align:middle line:90%
What does your body do?

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:17.520 align:middle line:84%
It puts inflammatory omega 6s
from our diet in its place.

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
when they break down?

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.820 align:middle line:84%
They can't break down
into maresins, protectins,

00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:23.210 align:middle line:90%
and resolvins.

00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:26.090 align:middle line:90%
So you do develop inflammation.

00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:28.420 align:middle line:84%
What is inflammation,
fundamentally,

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:30.940 align:middle line:84%
to the ladies listening or
the whole audience listening

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:31.440 align:middle line:90%
to this?

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.120 align:middle line:90%
It's a positive charge.

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:37.390 align:middle line:84%
What did we say before
about water and seafood?

00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:38.360 align:middle line:90%
Net negative charge.

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:40.190 align:middle line:84%
How do you get rid
of a positive charge?

00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:41.150 align:middle line:90%
A negative.

00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:43.747 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have DHA back
in the system to do that.

00:53:43.747 --> 00:53:45.413 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about blue light

00:53:45.413 --> 00:53:46.954 align:middle line:84%
and the sources of
blue light that we

00:53:46.954 --> 00:53:48.410 align:middle line:90%
encounter on a daily basis.

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
what happens, say,

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:53.130 align:middle line:84%
you've got your
laptop and you decide

00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:55.660 align:middle line:84%
you're going to go on
to Netflix and maybe put

00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:59.370 align:middle line:84%
a pillow on your belly and
kick back and watch your two

00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:01.820 align:middle line:84%
hours on your computer
screen before you

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:03.420 align:middle line:90%
go to sleep at night.

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: That's a bad thing.

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want you
to explain why and what

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.420 align:middle line:90%
happens when we do that.

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Let's finish
the DHA story first.

00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:17.290 align:middle line:84%
What blue light does is when it
destroys DHA, because you have

00:54:17.290 --> 00:54:19.700 align:middle line:84%
more of it in your
eye, there's a thing

00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:22.010 align:middle line:84%
on the top of your
optic nerves that

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:23.920 align:middle line:84%
goes right before
your brain called

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:26.450 align:middle line:90%
the suprachiasmatic nucleus.

00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:29.410 align:middle line:84%
That nucleus is
your atomic clock.

00:54:29.410 --> 00:54:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Now I got to teach
you a physics lesson

00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:33.310 align:middle line:90%
before we get to the laptop.

00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Everybody watching
this talk knows

00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:38.060 align:middle line:84%
that they have a GPS
device, either in a garment

00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:39.260 align:middle line:90%
or on their phone.

00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:41.580 align:middle line:84%
What you don't know
is how it works.

00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Up above us right now,
there are satellites

00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:46.150 align:middle line:84%
that have atomic
clocks that work

00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:51.190 align:middle line:84%
38 microseconds faster than
your cell phones on this planet.

00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:53.250 align:middle line:84%
The reason that has
to happen is because

00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:55.180 align:middle line:90%
of Einstein's relativity.

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:56.950 align:middle line:90%
Again, we're back to physics.

00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:57.500 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Blue light bends under
the force of gravity.

00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:03.810 align:middle line:84%
People don't realize that,
that time is relative.

00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:06.790 align:middle line:84%
So the same thing
happens in biochemistry.

00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:10.260 align:middle line:84%
The reason why you have to
have more DHA in your eye,

00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:13.170 align:middle line:84%
it has to run the atomic
clock in your head

00:55:13.170 --> 00:55:16.640 align:middle line:84%
faster than the one in your
breasts, and your belly,

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:19.600 align:middle line:84%
in your uterus, or
in your feet in order

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:22.170 align:middle line:90%
for signaling to work properly.

00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:25.342 align:middle line:84%
When you don't have enough here,
this runs slower than the one

00:55:25.342 --> 00:55:26.300 align:middle line:90%
here, that's a problem.

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:27.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when your
timing's off, everything's off.

00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:28.573 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: You got it.

00:55:28.573 --> 00:55:31.030 align:middle line:84%
I always use the
analogy with FedEx.

00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:33.150 align:middle line:84%
If FedEx has arrivals
and deliveries come

00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:35.310 align:middle line:84%
at the same day
instead of being yoked,

00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:37.900 align:middle line:84%
would you want to be in
the warehouse at the time?

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:38.507 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:55:38.507 --> 00:55:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's exactly what
happens in biochemistry.

00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And when that kind of chaos
happens in the cell, what

00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:43.700 align:middle line:90%
do we call it?

00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:44.640 align:middle line:90%
Call it chaos.

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.160 align:middle line:90%
What's a synonym for chaos?

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.240 align:middle line:90%
Inflammation.

00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:48.800 align:middle line:84%
What's a synonym
for information?

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Positive charge, a lack
of negative charge.

00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:54.070 align:middle line:90%
We're back to DHA again.

00:55:54.070 --> 00:55:56.870 align:middle line:84%
See, everything
comes back to DHA.

00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But that's fixable.

00:55:58.170 --> 00:56:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: It is, as long
as I can get you to stop--

00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:02.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Get some
sun, have some--

00:56:02.330 --> 00:56:03.420 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: No, you
got to eat seafood.

00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:05.295 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And eat some
of the proper seafood.

00:56:05.295 --> 00:56:06.237 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:56:06.237 --> 00:56:07.570 align:middle line:90%
You put it the other way around.

00:56:07.570 --> 00:56:09.360 align:middle line:90%
Seafood first, sun second.

00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Seafood's always first,
and here's the reason why.

00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:16.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to keep hammering back
the point, 600 million years,

00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:19.084 align:middle line:90%
it hasn't been replaced.

00:56:19.084 --> 00:56:20.750 align:middle line:84%
You need to realize
how important it is.

00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:21.390 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:24.580 align:middle line:84%
The clock mechanism has to
run faster than everyone else.

00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Getting to your point, most
women know about a IUD.

00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Most women, if you
go ask your OBGYN,

00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:33.630 align:middle line:84%
they don't know
how an IUD works.

00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:35.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell
you how it works.

00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:36.600 align:middle line:90%
It has copper in it.

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:38.540 align:middle line:90%
Copper is a transition metal.

00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:42.750 align:middle line:84%
All electromagnetic
radiation is drawn to metals.

00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:45.310 align:middle line:84%
So when you put a
laptop on your uterus,

00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:49.670 align:middle line:84%
you're driving this circadian
clock faster than the one here.

00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:middle line:84%
So, effectively, your
laptop is your best form

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:53.562 align:middle line:90%
of birth control.

00:56:53.562 --> 00:56:56.020 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why young
kids that put their cell phones

00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:56.585 align:middle line:90%
in their pocket--

00:56:56.585 --> 00:56:57.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Infertility.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.166 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: It's exactly right.

00:56:58.166 --> 00:57:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you look, if
you're old enough,

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:03.440 align:middle line:84%
you realize, back
in the 50s and 60s,

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.620 align:middle line:84%
people would get
pregnant like that.

00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:07.900 align:middle line:90%
Today, that's changed.

00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why it's changed
is because we've allowed things

00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:11.240 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:14.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people don't realize
that just 25, 30 years ago,

00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:14.950 align:middle line:90%
there was no internet.

00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:19.460 align:middle line:84%
The only people that had
non-native electrical things

00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:22.760 align:middle line:84%
were people who were rich in the
'70s who had microwave ovens.

00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:23.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we've all--

00:57:23.770 --> 00:57:26.061 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we've had
artificial light for a while.

00:57:26.061 --> 00:57:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Well, since
1924 in the states.

00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:31.160 align:middle line:84%
But it started back with
the electric wars back

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.610 align:middle line:90%
in the 1890s.

00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:36.850 align:middle line:84%
But the point is
we've added the power.

00:57:36.850 --> 00:57:40.680 align:middle line:84%
In other words, incandescent
bulbs to the new LED bulbs

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:45.010 align:middle line:84%
are nightmarish in terms of
understanding the physics.

00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is, and
I wanted to get to this,

00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:51.740 align:middle line:84%
I did a study on my own patients
when I was back in Nashville

00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:53.900 align:middle line:90%
that you may actually like.

00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:56.360 align:middle line:84%
I asked people to tell me
how many times they looked

00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.510 align:middle line:90%
at their cell phone in one day.

00:57:58.510 --> 00:58:00.870 align:middle line:90%
The average was 150 times.

00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Just so you know, that's
texting or looking.

00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:05.920 align:middle line:90%
So you look 150 times.

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.120 align:middle line:84%
What did I say before about
the Leptin Prescription?

00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:11.410 align:middle line:84%
You're designed to set the
atomic clock in the morning.

00:58:11.410 --> 00:58:12.690 align:middle line:90%
So if you do this 150 times--

00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:14.106 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it
keeps taking off--

00:58:14.106 --> 00:58:17.090 align:middle line:84%
setting your clock off and
off, is your clock goes off.

00:58:17.090 --> 00:58:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: You got
the message, see?

00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:21.120 align:middle line:84%
This quantum physics
thing isn't that hard.

00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.620 align:middle line:84%
See, I always tell
people, it's kind

00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:25.260 align:middle line:84%
of like you don't have to
speak Mandarin Chinese to like

00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:26.440 align:middle line:90%
Chinese food.

00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:28.330 align:middle line:84%
You just need to
understand that when

00:58:28.330 --> 00:58:30.120 align:middle line:84%
you look at that blue
light every time,

00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:33.740 align:middle line:84%
you just sent a message to your
brain that the sun just rose.

00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:34.470 align:middle line:90%
That's a problem.

00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what
emits blue light?

00:58:35.970 --> 00:58:37.240 align:middle line:90%
Tell us.

00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Everything that's
technology based today.

00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:40.360 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Including
your televisions?

00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:42.370 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: You got it.

00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:44.660 align:middle line:90%
And here's my rule.

00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:47.257 align:middle line:84%
You can block that by using
amber glasses, you know--

00:58:47.257 --> 00:58:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going
to ask you about that.

00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: We talk about--
we talk about that

00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:53.280 align:middle line:90%
on my forum a tremendous amount.

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.730 align:middle line:84%
You saw my phone today,
you mentioned it.

00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:58.210 align:middle line:84%
I have a blue light, I have
a blue light protector on it.

00:58:58.210 --> 00:59:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Because when I'm on
call, I get called in,

00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:03.459 align:middle line:84%
I don't want my melatonin
cycle to be broken.

00:59:03.459 --> 00:59:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And on that study,
I was telling you,

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.360 align:middle line:84%
all those people that
look at their cell

00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:09.320 align:middle line:90%
phone every time, what happens?

00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:12.070 align:middle line:84%
They get an imbalance between
cortisol and melatonin.

00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:12.804 align:middle line:90%
What is cortisol?

00:59:12.804 --> 00:59:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Cortisol is highest
in the morning

00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:17.860 align:middle line:84%
when the sun rises and melatonin
is highest when it's dark.

00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:20.400 align:middle line:84%
So when you have a circadian
mismatch, what do you get?

00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:22.410 align:middle line:84%
You get something
called adrenal fatigue.

00:59:22.410 --> 00:59:24.092 align:middle line:90%
Adrenal fatigue is a circadian--

00:59:24.092 --> 00:59:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Again, an epidemic.

00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>>KRUSE: Right, a
circadian mismatch

00:59:27.290 --> 00:59:28.550 align:middle line:90%
between light and dark.

00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Your brain and your cells
can't tell night from day.

00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:33.250 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:59:33.250 --> 00:59:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Because you've created
an artificial environment

00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:36.520 align:middle line:90%
that has destroyed that.

00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And what did we say is the
key driver to everything

00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:40.950 align:middle line:90%
in biology?

00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:41.890 align:middle line:90%
Light.

00:59:41.890 --> 00:59:42.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not food.

00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:45.030 align:middle line:90%
Food is the third coupled cycle.

00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:46.980 align:middle line:84%
The first cycle
is ubiquitination,

00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:48.620 align:middle line:90%
which is driven by light.

00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:50.260 align:middle line:90%
Second one is the cell cycle.

00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:51.660 align:middle line:90%
Why is that important?

00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:52.630 align:middle line:90%
That's cancer.

00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:55.370 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason why
colon cancer in 1900

00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:58.480 align:middle line:84%
was the 37th cause of
cancer in the United States.

00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.650 align:middle line:90%
Today, it's number two.

01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Again, in 120 years, we're
talking about a disease that's

01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:05.490 align:middle line:90%
manifest.

01:00:05.490 --> 01:00:08.740 align:middle line:84%
If you believe it's genetic,
you have different sensibility

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:09.300 align:middle line:90%
than I do.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:09.950 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Because in five or
six generations,

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:13.210 align:middle line:90%
it can't change that fast.

01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, it doesn't
change, not like that.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>>KRUSE: What drives it?

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Higher ubiquitination rates from
the environment that we allow.

01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:22.790 align:middle line:84%
So here's the best
message I give people.

01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:24.630 align:middle line:84%
If you begin to control
the environment,

01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:28.980 align:middle line:84%
there is not a disease that
you can't biohack and reverse.

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:31.510 align:middle line:90%
I proved it by doing what I did.

01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Many people who follow me
have done the same thing.

01:00:33.850 --> 01:00:37.060 align:middle line:84%
It's a very different
paradigm to realize

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.410 align:middle line:84%
that the prescription for
wellness is built into you.

01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:41.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not a genetic defect.

01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:44.180 align:middle line:84%
You are not
fundamentally broken.

01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:46.230 align:middle line:84%
The environment that
you allow because you

01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:51.220 align:middle line:84%
have this powerful brain is what
allows you to break yourself.

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And you need to understand
that you need to really control

01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:56.770 align:middle line:90%
that aspect of your life.

01:00:56.770 --> 01:00:58.650 align:middle line:84%
If you're not
willing to do that,

01:00:58.650 --> 01:01:00.360 align:middle line:90%
biology has a plan for you.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.140 align:middle line:90%
It's called extinction.

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And you will pay the price
in some Neolithic disease,

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.820 align:middle line:84%
the Neolithic diseases that you
started with in the beginning

01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:10.030 align:middle line:90%
of this interview.

01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And the key point
is how this develops

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:17.410 align:middle line:84%
over time is going to be the
rapidity in which diseases

01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:20.910 align:middle line:84%
manifest in you or the
severity in which they come.

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:26.604 align:middle line:90%


01:01:26.604 --> 01:01:27.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We're out of time.

01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:28.617 align:middle line:90%
That hour just flew.

01:01:28.617 --> 01:01:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And that was such a beautiful--
I was going to ask you-- well,

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.500 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask
you a lot more things,

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:34.825 align:middle line:84%
but I think we've gone
exactly where we need to go.

01:01:34.825 --> 01:01:36.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love to have
you back at another time

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:39.090 align:middle line:84%
to speak about some of the
other aspects of your work

01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:40.210 align:middle line:90%
we didn't even get to.

01:01:40.210 --> 01:01:42.456 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
critical stuff, right?

01:01:42.456 --> 01:01:45.080 align:middle line:10%
>>KRUSE: Yeah, I think-- I think
it's the most critical things.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:48.250 align:middle line:10%
And like I said, if anybody
needs more information--

01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:50.670 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oh, your site
is replete with thousands
