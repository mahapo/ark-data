00:00:18.924 --> 00:00:21.890 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Many people
know of the elongated skulls

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.980 align:middle line:10%
of the royal family of the
18th dynastic period of Egypt.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.250 align:middle line:10%
This has puzzled archeologists
and researchers for centuries.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Who are these people and
why were their skulls

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.759 align:middle line:90%
shaped like this?

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Maria Wheatley is
here with us today

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.740 align:middle line:84%
from England to take us
on a journey of skulls,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.730 align:middle line:84%
saying they were not
just like that in Egypt

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.210 align:middle line:90%
and why this matters.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.860 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, it's good to see you.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.460 align:middle line:84%
Last time I saw
you was in London.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MARIA WHEATLEY:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.627 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we're
trying to figure it out.

00:00:48.627 --> 00:00:52.690 align:middle line:84%
It was probably 2017 or 18,
and we opened this subject

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.490 align:middle line:90%
up a little bit.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.280 align:middle line:84%
But you, man, you've
done a lot of work since.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.113 align:middle line:90%
You've been digging.

00:00:56.113 --> 00:00:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes, yes.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's been quite a bit.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And you have some really
fascinating new news

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.710 align:middle line:90%
to share with us today.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, for people
who weren't watching Gaia seven

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.820 align:middle line:84%
years ago or so,
tell us a little bit

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.070 align:middle line:84%
about your background,
your father's background

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.590 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that you
were master dowsers

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.106 align:middle line:84%
and how that factors
into your research.

00:01:17.106 --> 00:01:18.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.890 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I'm a
second-generation master dowser

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.320 align:middle line:10%
who's been studying
Earth energies and ley

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.790 align:middle line:10%
lines for lifetime now, really.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.210 align:middle line:10%
And through my
dowsing career, it

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.270 align:middle line:10%
led me to the discovery
of the elongated skull

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.990 align:middle line:10%
people of Stonehenge.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.220 align:middle line:10%
And this led to a much wider
search across the British Isles,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.250 align:middle line:10%
across Europe, to find out
more about this long-lost race

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.755 align:middle line:10%
that the archeologists in
the UK do not speak about.

00:01:46.755 --> 00:01:49.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, when people
are hearing you right there,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.220 align:middle line:84%
they're saying, whoa,
whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.670 align:middle line:90%
Longheaded skulls at Stonehenge?

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.110 align:middle line:90%
I haven't heard of this before.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, how
new is this discovery

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.640 align:middle line:84%
that these skulls existed there
because this isn't well covered.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: No.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.590 align:middle line:84%
I was the first
person to discover

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.520 align:middle line:84%
the elongated skulls of the
British Isles, for example.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.396 align:middle line:84%
And really, I got
there through dowsing.

00:02:11.396 --> 00:02:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us about
that, how you found these?

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Because we know that
universities put tons of money

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.500 align:middle line:84%
into digs and so forth,
but there are other ways

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.585 align:middle line:90%
to locate things.

00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Absolutely.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.230 align:middle line:84%
I got a map of the
Stonehenge environs

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.860 align:middle line:90%
and placed it in my living room.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So this massive
map of Stonehenge.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.950 align:middle line:84%
And then in dowsing,
it's always been

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.730 align:middle line:84%
said that you ask a pendulum
or a rod what to find.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.660 align:middle line:84%
For example, show me
the nearest ley line.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Is there a skull associated
with this barrow?

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.090 align:middle line:84%
I thought I would
turn it on its head

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and do a completely
different approach.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And I asked the landscape,
what do you want me to find?

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.510 align:middle line:10%
And then from that, I
literally got fixated

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.410 align:middle line:10%
on this massive long barrow.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.750 align:middle line:10%
I began to research it and found
out it housed just one person,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.820 align:middle line:10%
and that person was a woman.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's unprecedented
in the ancient world,

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.160 align:middle line:84%
because normally long barrows
housed up to 30, 40, 50 people.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.420 align:middle line:84%
This barrow was, for a
royal person, probably,

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.160 align:middle line:84%
maybe even a high
queen of Stonehenge.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.866 align:middle line:84%
And her skull was
very elongated.

00:03:21.866 --> 00:03:24.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so for people
that don't know about this,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.640 align:middle line:90%
back up a little bit.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.680 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what long barrows are.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: That's right.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.860 align:middle line:84%
What are-- what
is a long barrow?

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a big Neolithic monument.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.470 align:middle line:90%
That means it's 5,500 years old.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.240 align:middle line:90%
Orthodox dating.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really long piece
of earthwork like this.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.036 align:middle line:90%
It's extended.

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Other than--
It's not a mound.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.160 align:middle line:90%
It's more rectangular.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yeah, exactly.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.660 align:middle line:10%
It's very long, and
it has chambers.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.450 align:middle line:10%
And inside of those
chambers you often find

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.380 align:middle line:10%
elongated skull people.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.660 align:middle line:10%
Now there was a saying going
back to the 15th century,

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.310 align:middle line:10%
"Long barrows, long skulls.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.220 align:middle line:90%
Round barrows, round skulls."

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And when I read that
remark, I thought, OK, I'm

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.110 align:middle line:84%
going to look at all of the long
barrows surrounding Stonehenge.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And all of the round barrows,
of which there were 800 round

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.370 align:middle line:90%
barrows alone.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.839 align:middle line:84%
And I read every single
report to find out

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.620 align:middle line:90%
who was in the landscape.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.200 align:middle line:84%
I found shamans, priestesses,
elongated people,

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.296 align:middle line:84%
a long-lost history that
has never been voiced.

00:04:32.296 --> 00:04:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm surprised that
why hasn't this come out before,

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.810 align:middle line:84%
before your innovative way
to start looking at the land

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.940 align:middle line:90%
through dowsing?

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.435 align:middle line:84%
Hasn't anyone else stumbled
across this before?

00:04:44.435 --> 00:04:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Not the long skulls.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.010 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like they
were completely ignored.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.140 align:middle line:84%
When I went to a university
to photograph and study

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.250 align:middle line:84%
the skull that I had found
at Stonehenge, the woman.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.410 align:middle line:90%
She hadn't been seen since 1930.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.030 align:middle line:84%
You have to log in at
Cambridge and put in the dates

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:84%
that you're visiting and
the purpose and the reason

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.080 align:middle line:84%
why you want to
see human remains.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.310 align:middle line:90%
And I was really shocked.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.810 align:middle line:84%
I thought this specimen
is unique to the world,

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.160 align:middle line:90%
not just to England.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.856 align:middle line:84%
And literally ignored
for centuries.

00:05:19.856 --> 00:05:23.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to get
into the tall people and height

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.880 align:middle line:90%
and such.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:84%
But was she a tall
entity, the one

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.055 align:middle line:90%
who was buried in that barrow?

00:05:30.055 --> 00:05:31.910 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: No.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:10%
They were literally two types of
people in prehistoric Britain.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.480 align:middle line:10%
The elongated skull people had
long skulls, but very small

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.660 align:middle line:10%
faces.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.970 align:middle line:90%
They almost look childlike.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.390 align:middle line:90%
Their ears are offset.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
very ET sounding.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Oh, it is.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.450 align:middle line:90%
Their ears are offset.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.020 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that you
can't see our ears

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.620 align:middle line:90%
because we've got hair over it.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.430 align:middle line:84%
But there's a further
back giving them

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:03.050 align:middle line:84%
quite a mythological look, like
the Fey or elves, for example.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.010 align:middle line:84%
Their femur bones, which I
measured, numerous femur bones,

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.400 align:middle line:84%
gave a height for a male to be
about 5 foot 4, and women 4 feet

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.200 align:middle line:90%
9.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.180 align:middle line:84%
They were small, very
small and slender looking.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.252 align:middle line:84%
Literally like the Irish would
describe their fairy folk.

00:06:21.252 --> 00:06:22.422 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And then what?

00:06:22.422 --> 00:06:23.630 align:middle line:90%
You said there are two types.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.480 align:middle line:84%
That's one type, the
elongated skull type

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.465 align:middle line:90%
and the ancient times.

00:06:26.465 --> 00:06:27.465 align:middle line:90%
What was the other type?

00:06:27.465 --> 00:06:28.265 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Right.

00:06:28.265 --> 00:06:31.940 align:middle line:84%
So we've got these really
extended very long skulls,

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.290 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Then there was another
race at the same time

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.080 align:middle line:90%
as the elongated skull people.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.530 align:middle line:84%
They had long skulls, but not
as long as the royal family

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.640 align:middle line:90%
or the rulers of the areas.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So there's two types of
elongated skulls, one lesser

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.266 align:middle line:90%
and one greater.

00:06:51.266 --> 00:06:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the 18th diagnostic
period that's depicted in Egypt,

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.700 align:middle line:84%
would that be considered a
longer elongated skull or--?

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Very similar.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Egypt's skulls to Maltese
skulls to British skulls.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.700 align:middle line:90%
They're very, very similar.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.080 align:middle line:84%
They're like a mirror
into each other.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
would have thought

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.930 align:middle line:84%
that Egypt would be
influencing Britain

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.153 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient times in terms
of the migration of people.

00:07:19.153 --> 00:07:21.695 align:middle line:84%
But you say it might have been
somewhat the other way around.

00:07:21.695 --> 00:07:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Exactly.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Because when we look to ancient
Egypt and the connections

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.240 align:middle line:84%
to the British
Isles, for example,

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.030 align:middle line:84%
you had what's called retainer
burials of the very early Old

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:90%
Kingdom of Egypt.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is when the
pharaoh would die.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And his servants, rather would
go into the burial with him

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.500 align:middle line:84%
because they believed so
much in the afterlife.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.570 align:middle line:84%
We would find that
quite macabre.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Why should people
go to death with me?

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:53.870 align:middle line:84%
But it was an honor
in ancient times.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And preceding that in England,
by about two centuries,

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.930 align:middle line:84%
the ancient British
people were doing that.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.190 align:middle line:84%
The lesser long
skulls were found

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.620 align:middle line:84%
being ritualistically
killed, that

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:84%
were placed alongside
the ones with

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.816 align:middle line:90%
the elongated extended skulls.

00:08:11.816 --> 00:08:14.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
is the thought?

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Is it that the very
elongated skull

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.860 align:middle line:84%
would tend to be bloodlines that
were more royal, for example?

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: I think so.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.568 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the
others were those

00:08:23.568 --> 00:08:26.025 align:middle line:84%
that there were
companions and served them

00:08:26.025 --> 00:08:28.525 align:middle line:84%
in some capacity, which is why
they went to death with them?

00:08:28.525 --> 00:08:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes,
that's what we're

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.179 align:middle line:84%
thinking, because it
was time and time again

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:33.210 align:middle line:90%
this was happening.

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.110 align:middle line:84%
You had the extended
elongated skull person

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.740 align:middle line:90%
showing no signs of being--

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.630 align:middle line:84%
They often cleft
them in the head

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.150 align:middle line:84%
like this, like in
a ritual killing.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And that was shown all the times
on the lesser long-skulled,

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.800 align:middle line:84%
whereas the elongated
extended skulls,

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.380 align:middle line:84%
they showed no signs
of any violence.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And that was repeated
time and again.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I've got about 150 documented
cases of that type of burial,

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.520 align:middle line:84%
and it is called
a retainer burial.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Even when it comes to the
druids of the Iron Age,

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.180 align:middle line:84%
much, much later than
prehistoric Britain,

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Caesar occupied England
with the Romans,

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.120 align:middle line:84%
and he reported that
the Celts were still

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.460 align:middle line:84%
doing retainer burials
then, and it was an honor.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're looking at it
not to be a macabre thought,

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.920 align:middle line:84%
but they believed
in the afterlife

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.290 align:middle line:84%
so much that they wanted
to go to the afterlife.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was an invitation.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So on the elongated
skulls, do you

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.180 align:middle line:84%
know whether these were
genetically elongated skulls

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.280 align:middle line:84%
or whether maybe with the lesser
elongated skulls, that this

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.080 align:middle line:84%
may have been a practice of some
kind, some kind of binding head

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.910 align:middle line:84%
at birth, in order to have
a certain characteristic?

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Or is this thought
to be purely genetic?

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: It's difficult
to tell to get 100% accuracy.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.660 align:middle line:10%
What I think was
in occurrence was

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.620 align:middle line:10%
they may have been bind in their
skulls to make them slightly

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:08.450 align:middle line:10%
longer, because there were two
scars found either side coming

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:12.140 align:middle line:10%
down here, which is a strong
suggestion that they were

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.740 align:middle line:10%
extending their skulls
but born with a long skull

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.260 align:middle line:10%
that they were then
extending, so that

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.580 align:middle line:10%
could be a high possibility.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they are two
separate people that

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.020 align:middle line:90%
were living at the same time.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now I find
that really interesting.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.020 align:middle line:84%
So if they were
extending the skulls,

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.400 align:middle line:90%
would it have been for some--

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming for the perception
of belonging to a certain class

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:84%
or group of people, or because
there was some functional

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.300 align:middle line:90%
benefit to it?

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.288 align:middle line:84%
What functional benefit
could there have been?

00:10:46.288 --> 00:10:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And I know I'm throwing you
stuff way out in left field

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.110 align:middle line:84%
now, to having an
elongated skull.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Or was it just to say,
I'm a member of this clan.

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.075 align:middle line:90%
I'm part of these people?

00:10:55.075 --> 00:10:55.875 align:middle line:90%
In your opinion.

00:10:55.875 --> 00:10:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: Yeah,
in my opinion, I

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.030 align:middle line:84%
think it really is about one
being noticed that you're

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:03.400 align:middle line:90%
looking different as a ruler.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.040 align:middle line:84%
But as well, I
think the practices

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.330 align:middle line:84%
that could have been in
occurrence with them,

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.990 align:middle line:84%
that they could have
been the priesthood

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:15.860 align:middle line:84%
and somehow that could maybe
enhance their intuition,

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.300 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Because when we come to
look at the artifacts that

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:23.240 align:middle line:84%
were placed in the long
barrows alongside them,

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:28.010 align:middle line:84%
they were often shamanic,
with items of incense pots,

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:34.010 align:middle line:84%
for example, and stag horns that
were polished, highly polished,

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.420 align:middle line:84%
and not used to
prise out chalk that

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.100 align:middle line:90%
was thought by archeologists.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:43.145 align:middle line:84%
So I think that they were
highly intuitive race of people.

00:11:43.145 --> 00:11:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is bringing something
out of left field to mind.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Many years ago, I was
meditating on this,

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:56.610 align:middle line:84%
that the Mayans that were
raising their children into more

00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:01.140 align:middle line:84%
of a priestly class had an
item dangled in front of them

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:05.200 align:middle line:84%
that created a cross-eyed
pattern in the young kids,

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.840 align:middle line:84%
and that was thought
to be desirable

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.500 align:middle line:90%
because it enhanced intuition.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.140 align:middle line:90%
And I started flashing that.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, when you step
down from the original people.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Looking back on
that, I remember when

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.860 align:middle line:84%
I first started learning to
connect with the other side,

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.940 align:middle line:84%
with guides and so forth,
my eyes automatically

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.820 align:middle line:84%
rolled up in a
crossed eyed pattern

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and everything would
open very quickly.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I think the
original Mayans,

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.210 align:middle line:84%
this was just a matter of
what they did as practice.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And then it gets stepped down
after generation, generation.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Then you probably don't even
know why the royal family should

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.150 align:middle line:90%
have crossed eyes anymore.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.040 align:middle line:84%
It may not even be
functional anymore,

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.795 align:middle line:84%
but I'm wondering if
it's similar in that way.

00:12:46.795 --> 00:12:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: I think it could be
because there was practices done

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.970 align:middle line:84%
in South America to
look at earth energies

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:54.912 align:middle line:90%
from a completely new angle.

00:12:54.912 --> 00:12:56.870 align:middle line:84%
They used to get the
children that they thought

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:59.490 align:middle line:84%
were very receptive
to earth energies,

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:03.320 align:middle line:84%
and place them in quite a dark
environment for the first seven

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.470 align:middle line:90%
years of their life.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:90%
This is the Kogi Indians.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: And then they would
open up the landscape to them,

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.500 align:middle line:84%
and they could see earth
energies through the colors

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.520 align:middle line:84%
that they emitted
in the landscape.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Intriguingly, all
the long barrows,

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.360 align:middle line:84%
every single long barrow
in Europe, as well as

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.880 align:middle line:84%
in the British Isles
are on particular types

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.210 align:middle line:90%
of earth energies.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:27.410 align:middle line:84%
So I think that was
enhancing their ability

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.990 align:middle line:84%
to be perceptive,
intuitive, spiritual.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.440 align:middle line:84%
These were spiritual leaders
that made capitals out

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:38.260 align:middle line:84%
of the megalithic monuments
like Stonehenge, like Avebury.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That makes sense.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you researched one of
these stranger Neolithic burial

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:48.880 align:middle line:84%
sites, and it had to do with an
entity similar to the Starchild,

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.850 align:middle line:90%
that Lloyd Pye became known for.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about the Starchild
and what you discovered.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Again, when I was
reading the reports

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:01.680 align:middle line:84%
about the long barrows
surrounding Stonehenge.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.580 align:middle line:84%
It must have been about the
50th report that I had read.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly, I thought,
what on Earth am I reading?

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.860 align:middle line:84%
This was a report done by
a Victorian archeologist

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.190 align:middle line:90%
and anthropologist.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.710 align:middle line:84%
He said he'd dug
into a long barrow,

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and he was stopped in
his tracks because what

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:25.840 align:middle line:84%
he saw was elongated skull
people in a circle tightly knit.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.200 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that
you're around people

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.600 align:middle line:84%
in a circle that
has never been seen

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:35.750 align:middle line:84%
in the long barrows preceding
that dig inside of which of that

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:40.140 align:middle line:84%
circle was a very strange
being or creature,

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.820 align:middle line:84%
and it was described as having
the eyes on top of its head.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.550 align:middle line:90%
Its skull was slightly long.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:50.210 align:middle line:84%
It seemed to have a
much thicker skull

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:53.490 align:middle line:84%
than the other normal
long-skulled people,

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.920 align:middle line:90%
and it had a tail as well.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.930 align:middle line:90%
And they described the tail.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And when I showed this
report to somebody

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.378 align:middle line:84%
that worked with Lloyd
Pye, the doctor that

00:15:03.378 --> 00:15:04.670 align:middle line:90%
was looking into the Starchild.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this was
in the 1930s in Mexico.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.520 align:middle line:90%
Just to set his work up.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.440 align:middle line:90%
Almost 100 years ago.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:10.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:11.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes.

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:12.810 align:middle line:90%
A long time ago.

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And I showed the report
to the doctor that

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.580 align:middle line:84%
was working with Lloyd
Pye, and he said,

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.850 align:middle line:84%
this sounds identical
to the Starchild.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:24.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, this barrow is on
the exact axis line.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.830 align:middle line:84%
If you imagine a line drawn
from the center of Stonehenge

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.180 align:middle line:84%
and you just draw
it north and south,

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.670 align:middle line:90%
that's called an axis line.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.350 align:middle line:84%
For example, that barrow
is exactly on that line,

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:39.080 align:middle line:84%
on the most powerful Earth
energies in the area.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.180 align:middle line:90%
And it was a different burial.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was shown to
be the case because this being,

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:50.410 align:middle line:84%
this creature was
literally so unusual

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.590 align:middle line:84%
that it was placed at
the center of the burial.

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's going to
be a while before we

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.910 align:middle line:90%
know what that's about.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Have they done
DNA testing on it?

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: Do you know what
I wish they would, Regina.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:03.860 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.532 align:middle line:90%
It frightened the archeologists.

00:16:05.532 --> 00:16:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I'm sure.

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:09.430 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: So much
that they put everything

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.990 align:middle line:90%
back to how they found it.

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:84%
They're still there
in the landscape,

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.430 align:middle line:90%
staring at Stonehenge today.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my God.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: So if we
could get a dig going,

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:84%
then we could actually proves
or disproves whatever theory

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:25.940 align:middle line:90%
we project at that.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.536 align:middle line:84%
So I would love
a new excavation.

00:16:28.536 --> 00:16:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, that would
be absolutely fascinating.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.790 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I'm wishing
you luck on that.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:35.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the things
some of these skulls had

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.792 align:middle line:84%
was evidence of what's
called trepanning, right?

00:16:39.792 --> 00:16:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Which is-- Explain
what trepanning is

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:46.600 align:middle line:84%
and why this procedure would
have been done on these skulls.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.840 align:middle line:90%
Trepanning is quite unusual.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.320 align:middle line:84%
It was widely, widely
done in the Neolithic.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.770 align:middle line:84%
So let's imagine a
skull of a living being.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.510 align:middle line:90%
This person is alive.

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:01.740 align:middle line:84%
They've got a long skull,
and they have a circle

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:05.920 align:middle line:84%
drilled out of their skull,
created normally about here.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And so we imagine that a
circle is taken out or here.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:11.710 align:middle line:90%
That's where they would trepan.

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.609 align:middle line:90%
Why would you go through that?

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:16.950 align:middle line:84%
When I looked at
the reports, again,

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:18.940 align:middle line:84%
of all of the
long-skulled people,

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.150 align:middle line:84%
they all showed one
sign of an anomaly.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And that anomaly was their
sutures froze and literally came

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.010 align:middle line:84%
together at a much, much
younger age than they would

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:34.320 align:middle line:84%
for an average person today,
which is 30 years old,

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.295 align:middle line:90%
your sutures will fuse together.

00:17:36.295 --> 00:17:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your skull
is solid and intact.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Exactly.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.360 align:middle line:84%
But that was happening at
a much, much younger age.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And there has been somebody
in England who in the 1960s,

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.740 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Amanda Feilding,
she did this operation

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.220 align:middle line:90%
on herself.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.077 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I know.

00:17:54.077 --> 00:17:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Literally?

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes, yes.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.940 align:middle line:90%
She got a drill and she made--

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's a DIY thing
I cannot even comprehend.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:02.540 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: No.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.390 align:middle line:90%
But she did.

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And she said suddenly her
consciousness changed and she

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.660 align:middle line:90%
felt the heartbeat in the head.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And she said her
consciousness went up.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.720 align:middle line:84%
So I think what the
elongated skull people

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.660 align:middle line:84%
were doing to trepan
their skulls is

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:21.510 align:middle line:84%
because their intuition may
have been lacking in some way.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Their sutures were
fusing together.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:27.020 align:middle line:84%
They could no longer hear
that heartbeat in their head,

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.320 align:middle line:84%
and so they would
trepan their skulls.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And that happened so commonly
to these types of people.

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:38.500 align:middle line:84%
But then again, I noticed
the ones that were trepanned

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.620 align:middle line:84%
had a different feature
in their long barrows

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.610 align:middle line:90%
that made it quite visual.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we again
visualize a piece of stone

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:49.540 align:middle line:84%
that is in a long barrow
where their eventually

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.410 align:middle line:90%
their remains were placed.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:56.000 align:middle line:84%
They all had a hole
carved out of the stone.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this stone is about
four or five feet thick,

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:05.410 align:middle line:84%
and they a perfect circle, as
if reflecting their operations

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:06.560 align:middle line:90%
on their skull.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So where
was this stone placed,

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.120 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to their body?

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.188 align:middle line:84%
Inside, near the
body or at the head?

00:19:12.188 --> 00:19:13.730 align:middle line:84%
At the head of the
body or something?

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:14.563 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Exactly.

00:19:14.563 --> 00:19:17.210 align:middle line:84%
They'd go through the
hole in the long barrow,

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.820 align:middle line:84%
and that's where their
remains were placed.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:23.210 align:middle line:84%
So every single holed
stone in a long barrow

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:26.340 align:middle line:90%
would house trepanned skulls.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.590 align:middle line:90%
And again, not--

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:29.007 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Both of
them were almost

00:19:29.007 --> 00:19:31.780 align:middle line:84%
like a portal to somewhere else
or consciousness elsewhere.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Oh, absolutely.

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:36.720 align:middle line:84%
I think when we look to the
mythology of holed stones,

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.790 align:middle line:84%
they're either taking
you somewhere else.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:41.870 align:middle line:84%
You're going from one place to
another, to the other world,

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:43.710 align:middle line:90%
to the druids.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that was
a very powerful and also

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.300 align:middle line:84%
in dowsing terms as well,
because obviously, I

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.760 align:middle line:84%
look to the unseen
as much as the seen.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.900 align:middle line:10%
And then I found out they
were on a very powerful vortex

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:57.840 align:middle line:10%
energy.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.980 align:middle line:10%
So if we say, OK,
these long barrows

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:05.160 align:middle line:10%
eventually housed the deposits
of the elongated skull people.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:09.390 align:middle line:84%
But what if prior to that,
this was their temple space?

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.690 align:middle line:84%
This is where they were
doing their divination

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:13.940 align:middle line:84%
from their healing
practices from,

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:18.410 align:middle line:84%
then they are on very, very
powerful earth energies that

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:23.150 align:middle line:84%
are influenced by the sun, by
the moon and by the stars alike.

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.600 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
these places were

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.860 align:middle line:84%
where they would choose to do
particular activities to do

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:35.090 align:middle line:84%
with psychic, intuition,
healing and other things

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.610 align:middle line:84%
we probably can
only just imagine.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that's
absolutely fascinating

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.810 align:middle line:84%
to think that they created
almost like a cranial release

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:46.930 align:middle line:84%
valve so they could unleash
their full consciousness

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.770 align:middle line:90%
through this hole in their head.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.230 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: It's a
very bizarre practice.

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And after, even when
they had been deceased,

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:58.870 align:middle line:84%
their relatives or maybe
the shamanic high priests

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:01.690 align:middle line:84%
would then take little
pieces of that bone

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.540 align:middle line:84%
and change them into amulets
that they would wear around

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:05.510 align:middle line:90%
their necks.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:10.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like these
people lived on and on and on.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And their bones were
revered for that.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:16.210 align:middle line:84%
So they must have had
something about them completely

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:19.090 align:middle line:90%
different to be so revered.

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Probably a hybrid
species of some kind.

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:24.380 align:middle line:84%
We can assume, probably even
assume that that's fair.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Absolutely.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:29.677 align:middle line:84%
Because when we look to--
why ignore this DNA evidence?

00:21:29.677 --> 00:21:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, that's just crazy.

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: Yeah, why ignore
the most unusual burial

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:39.430 align:middle line:84%
in the whole of Europe that I
found when it's there, intact?

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Could be an excellent
opportunity to get DNA.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:43.060 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Any
archeologists listening.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:46.630 align:middle line:90%
There's a big invitation.

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:48.915 align:middle line:84%
Could be the most exciting
ride of your life.

00:21:48.915 --> 00:21:50.790 align:middle line:84%
I hope that does come
to pass and that you're

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:51.680 align:middle line:90%
part of it, Maria.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Thank you.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:53.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
move on to something

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.160 align:middle line:84%
called the Tartarian
tablets of Europe.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Most people have
never heard of those.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:00.750 align:middle line:84%
They have no idea that
there were tablets predating

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:04.960 align:middle line:84%
cuneiform, which we all
assume is the oldest language,

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.550 align:middle line:90%
so to speak, symbolically.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:10.180 align:middle line:90%
And so tell us what they are.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And then if you
can if they've been

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:16.180 align:middle line:84%
translated at all, what they
were pointing to or contained?

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.700 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to hear
more about them.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.655 align:middle line:90%
And this is in Romania, right?

00:22:19.655 --> 00:22:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Which is interesting
because the whole series

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:26.030 align:middle line:84%
of books by someone with
the pseudonym Radu Cinamar

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:30.950 align:middle line:84%
is out there now, talking
about these incredible finds

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:35.030 align:middle line:84%
of ancient, ancient caves,
knowledge holograms and all

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:39.260 align:middle line:84%
this in Romania that's
protected by a military base.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.290 align:middle line:90%
How true this is?

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:41.850 align:middle line:90%
Some people say it's true.

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:43.895 align:middle line:84%
I don't know but it's
all out of Romania.

00:22:43.895 --> 00:22:45.020 align:middle line:90%
And this is out of Romania.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Absolutely.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we think, like you said,
that cuneiform is the oldest

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:57.350 align:middle line:84%
form of writing, again orthodox
dating to about 3,200 BC from

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Mesopotamia, modern
day Iraq and Iran.

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And they would use
angles to record things

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.720 align:middle line:90%
for economic purposes.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.320 align:middle line:84%
They will look into oh, I
owe you this, I owe you that.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:15.090 align:middle line:84%
So they were economical
records, if you will.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:17.750 align:middle line:10%
But the Tartarian tablets
are very different.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.150 align:middle line:10%
They're a metaphysical language.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:23.290 align:middle line:10%
They're a magical language,
and they were made up

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:28.195 align:middle line:10%
of five symbols, and these
date back 2000 years older

00:23:28.195 --> 00:23:28.995 align:middle line:10%
than cuneiform.

00:23:28.995 --> 00:23:30.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we're
talking over 7,000 years.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yeah, exactly.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.310 align:middle line:84%
So much, much older
than cuneiform.

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And they're made
up of five symbols.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.570 align:middle line:84%
You'd have a cross that
could be at any angle,

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:39.920 align:middle line:90%
literally like a cross.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you would have
a linear line, a dot,

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:48.980 align:middle line:84%
a curved piece of linear work,
and then a chevron pattern.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And from those five symbols
across ancient Europe

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.103 align:middle line:84%
are birthed in
Romania, we think.

00:23:55.103 --> 00:23:57.020 align:middle line:84%
But that's just because
they were found there.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.562 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
going to be found all

00:23:58.562 --> 00:24:00.770 align:middle line:90%
across Europe, for example.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And they would mean something
to these ancient peoples.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'd read this report.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.380 align:middle line:84%
I've been to Romania, I've
seen the Romanian Sphinx,

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.726 align:middle line:90%
I've been to Transylvania.

00:24:10.726 --> 00:24:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: --With my daughter.

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.520 align:middle line:90%
So I know the area quite well.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And when I was working at
a museum helping a curator,

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:25.230 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly looked and thought,
that's the same as the Tartarian

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:26.380 align:middle line:90%
tablets.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And I looked and
took a photograph

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.570 align:middle line:84%
and placed it right
by a photograph

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:32.620 align:middle line:90%
of what came out of Romania.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And they're very,
very identical.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think it's a
shamanic language.

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.420 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a
metaphysical language

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.320 align:middle line:90%
because there's no record.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.270 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't say oh,
I owe you something.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.980 align:middle line:84%
They were showing, for
example, deer heads, drums

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.850 align:middle line:90%
on particular tablets.

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:52.080 align:middle line:90%
And again, those five symbols.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And this came from Avebury,
this particular chalk tablet,

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:59.380 align:middle line:84%
which is the world's
largest stone circle.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Then I looked
towards Stonehenge.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And from one burial there
was a high priestess

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:09.040 align:middle line:84%
of the Bronze Age, and she
was buried with these tablets.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.660 align:middle line:90%
But they now looked runic.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.750 align:middle line:84%
OK, now the runes
were discovered

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:18.560 align:middle line:84%
around about the earliest known
inscriptions were from one 150

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.360 align:middle line:90%
AD.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is 2,500 BC and
they were very runic looking.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.310 align:middle line:84%
So I think this again was a
divination-- used in divination.

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:30.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some people
would say, no, the runes

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.290 align:middle line:84%
came from the Vikings, they
came from the Germanic people,

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:37.280 align:middle line:84%
but they are there at Stonehenge
and they're in a museum.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And they were put onto these
symbols, these rune symbols,

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:43.280 align:middle line:90%
onto tiny pieces of bone.

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's the thing
about stone Stonehenge.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.240 align:middle line:84%
If you imagine that you're
by the two altar stones.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.840 align:middle line:84%
I was the first to discover the
missing stones of Stonehenge.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And there were two altar
stones, and there would

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:58.970 align:middle line:90%
be a high priestess there.

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:01.790 align:middle line:84%
You had more high priestesses
than high priests,

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:05.930 align:middle line:84%
and they would have, for
example, these incense pots.

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, they've recently been
re-evaluated and looked

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:14.020 align:middle line:84%
at under a microscope and they
contained quite heavy opiates,

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:17.350 align:middle line:84%
so I think they were in
altered state of consciousness.

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:22.060 align:middle line:84%
But with the elongated
skull people of Stonehenge,

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:27.190 align:middle line:84%
I think they could change
light into sound technology.

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Because if you imagine
there's two altar

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.890 align:middle line:84%
stones at the heart
of Stonehenge,

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:36.330 align:middle line:84%
and then on the summer
solstice, it's well known,

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:40.020 align:middle line:84%
worldwide fame
that the sun aligns

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.840 align:middle line:84%
with the heel stone,
and a corridor of light

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.420 align:middle line:84%
would have gone into
the center of Stonehenge

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.610 align:middle line:90%
and hit those two altar stones.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, it is known on
a scientific level,

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:55.420 align:middle line:84%
for example, that
at dawn and sunset.

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I think,
Regina, standing stones

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:00.130 align:middle line:90%
are in alignment with the sun.

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:02.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not about looking
at a pretty event

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:06.580 align:middle line:84%
that people do today watching
the sun rise above a stone.

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.240 align:middle line:90%
Not so at all.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:14.060 align:middle line:84%
Because at dawn and at sunset
we see the sunset as red light

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.440 align:middle line:90%
predominantly, don't we?

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, in that red light you
have microwaves, radio waves,

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.240 align:middle line:90%
for example, as well.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.550 align:middle line:84%
So imagine all of
that as a cocktail.

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, microwaves
can be transduced.

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:29.120 align:middle line:84%
That means changed
to pressure waves

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.700 align:middle line:84%
when passed through a
piezoelectric material.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, what do we
have at Stonehenge?

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.100 align:middle line:84%
All of those stones are
piezoelectrical activity.

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:41.400 align:middle line:90%
And other stone circles as well.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:46.290 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is when the
sun rises at Stonehenge,

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.000 align:middle line:84%
you've got all of
these microwaves.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And then when it's pushed
through a piezoelectric material

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:56.670 align:middle line:84%
it changes that pressure
wave into sound, ultrasound.

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:58.050 align:middle line:90%
And that's a fact.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:00.050 align:middle line:84%
So I think that they
were programming

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.210 align:middle line:84%
that light to go
through the stone

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:05.960 align:middle line:84%
so that they would then
have this ultrasound.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Now I noticed on the
elongated skull people,

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.830 align:middle line:84%
not only, as I said
earlier, were there

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:13.570 align:middle line:90%
ears in a different position.

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:18.590 align:middle line:84%
When I gave a report and a
report to a doctor in London,

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:20.860 align:middle line:84%
for example, I
said, why are they

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:26.090 align:middle line:84%
saying these reports that
the ear bones are different?

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:28.130 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And she said, this
report is wrong.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I've copied,
cut, pasted from Oxford time

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.960 align:middle line:84%
and again, they're saying
this about their ear bones.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And she said they'd hear
different frequencies

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.130 align:middle line:90%
in all probability.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So I think they were hearing
the event at Stonehenge

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:47.660 align:middle line:84%
when that light was
transduced to sound.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Other experiments have
shown that stone circles,

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.860 align:middle line:84%
that the ultrasound
coming out of stones

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.450 align:middle line:84%
triggered by the
sun's placement,

00:28:56.450 --> 00:29:00.190 align:middle line:84%
literally goes up
to 40 meters away

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:01.910 align:middle line:90%
from the center of the stone.

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:03.980 align:middle line:90%
So the sound isn't coming in.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:04.870 align:middle line:90%
It's going out.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
emanating from there.

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And can you imagine what purpose
that might have served for them?

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:11.620 align:middle line:90%
Could it be they were hybrids?

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Could it be they're
speaking to beings

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.187 align:middle line:90%
and throughout the cosmos?

00:29:15.187 --> 00:29:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Could it be they're
speaking with the earth?

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.250 align:middle line:90%
We don't do we?

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: We don't know.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.800 align:middle line:84%
But what we do know is that
ultrasound can be recorded.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:24.820 align:middle line:90%
So it's a fact.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.330 align:middle line:84%
You can get literally
some equipment

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:30.090 align:middle line:84%
to go into any stone
circle, provided

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:32.770 align:middle line:84%
that the sun is
rising or setting,

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:34.665 align:middle line:84%
you will get that
type of activity.

00:29:34.665 --> 00:29:36.475 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have people
attempted to do that?

00:29:36.475 --> 00:29:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Oh, absolutely.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And are they
getting the sounds?

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:40.115 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Oh, absolutely.

00:29:40.115 --> 00:29:40.930 align:middle line:90%
I've got the sound.

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:41.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You do?

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:45.720 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes, I've done tests
because ultrasound equipment can

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.900 align:middle line:84%
be bought because bats follow
ultrasound energy, don't they?

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.310 align:middle line:90%
It's well documented.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:53.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you buy that
type of equipment

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.410 align:middle line:84%
you can then start to go to a
stone circle and test it out,

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:59.490 align:middle line:84%
which is what I have done,
and proceed in my team

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:01.790 align:middle line:84%
because I work with
a team of experts.

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Preceding that, one of my team
members was working with what

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:09.200 align:middle line:84%
was called the Dragon
Project in the 1970s and 80s,

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.450 align:middle line:84%
and they got exactly
the same results.

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:13.186 align:middle line:90%
It's about ultrasound.

00:30:13.186 --> 00:30:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when
you're listening to it,

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:18.530 align:middle line:84%
is it as though it's
just a constant sound,

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:21.850 align:middle line:84%
or is there almost fluctuating
sound or melody to it?

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: That's a really
interesting question.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.660 align:middle line:90%
What was found it's a pulse.

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Imagine like a pulse beat coming
out of the stones at that time.

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:33.110 align:middle line:90%
It's pulsing, pulsing, pulsing.

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:35.260 align:middle line:84%
Then it can go
quite faint and then

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.485 align:middle line:84%
it can pick up again
and go quite high.

00:30:37.485 --> 00:30:39.735 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just almost like
listening to the heartbeat.

00:30:39.735 --> 00:30:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yeah.

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.100 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: It's like
a megalithic heartbeat.

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And also what I discovered
about the standing

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:51.310 align:middle line:84%
stones as well is that they have
particular points on them where

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:53.780 align:middle line:84%
another form of
sound is released,

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:56.540 align:middle line:84%
coming out of that
particular point.

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's around
about 18 Hertz, OK.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.750 align:middle line:84%
We've measured it and
it was fascinating.

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:02.890 align:middle line:90%
The team were amazed.

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:04.620 align:middle line:84%
I would dowse the
stone and say, this

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.520 align:middle line:84%
is where the energy
is coming out.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.410 align:middle line:90%
And what is this energy?

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, my team found out that
it was sound, like I said,

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.410 align:middle line:90%
18 Hertz.

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.130 align:middle line:90%
We hear at 20.

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:19.220 align:middle line:84%
I think the elongated skull
people could hear the stones.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I have this written down
here that it has a dowsable,

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.270 align:middle line:84%
you call it a dowsable
pattern that's

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:29.246 align:middle line:90%
almost like concentric shells.

00:31:29.246 --> 00:31:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes.

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:35.460 align:middle line:84%
So if we see a standing stone
placed into predominantly

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.910 align:middle line:84%
the chalk bedrock at
Stonehenge and Avebury

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:41.620 align:middle line:84%
and in the north of England,
they're not in the earth,

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:44.350 align:middle line:84%
they're in the
solid chalk bedrock.

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And if you imagine a bit like
an acupuncture needle going

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:51.960 align:middle line:84%
into a meridian line, you need
an earth current, a ley line

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.730 align:middle line:84%
or a grid line to get
that stone active.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:57.030 align:middle line:84%
So you put it onto
a meridian line

00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:02.270 align:middle line:84%
and then it produces around
itself, concentric circle

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:07.200 align:middle line:84%
after concentric circle, going
way out from the standing stone.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's been documented
by my late father,

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:11.508 align:middle line:90%
and I'm a research author.

00:32:11.508 --> 00:32:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'm going to
get a team to measure this,

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.630 align:middle line:90%
to prove or disprove.

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:19.590 align:middle line:84%
I want the truth of what
standing stones are capable of.

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:23.040 align:middle line:84%
So we went on to the
first concentric circle,

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.280 align:middle line:84%
and we got a frequency
of 133 Hertz.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And we had control
areas as well.

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:33.275 align:middle line:84%
Well, 133 Hertz can put you
into very deep meditation.

00:32:33.275 --> 00:32:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like a theta state.

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:35.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Exactly.

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:38.310 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happens.

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So our next experiment was
rigging me up to a Mind Mirror,

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.740 align:middle line:84%
looking at my left hemisphere
and my right hemisphere

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.580 align:middle line:90%
at exactly the same time.

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain
this for us a bit.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yeah.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.630 align:middle line:84%
You're kind of rigged
up to a computer that

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:57.600 align:middle line:84%
is called the Mind Mirror, and
it's measuring my brain waves.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So like an EEG.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.600 align:middle line:90%
It has--

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Yeah.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:01.730 align:middle line:90%
I've got all rigged up.

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:02.897 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All rigged up, OK.

00:33:02.897 --> 00:33:06.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: And I'm having my
brain looked, my brain waves.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And like, now if I was
measured, I'm in beta.

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:11.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about
what I'm talking about.

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.605 align:middle line:84%
And you have different
alpha and delta.

00:33:14.605 --> 00:33:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then
you go into theta.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.292 align:middle line:90%
Then down into deep delta.

00:33:17.292 --> 00:33:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Delta, yes.

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:19.667 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which
is usually asleep.

00:33:19.667 --> 00:33:22.635 align:middle line:84%
But some people can be conscious
and access things from delta.

00:33:22.635 --> 00:33:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: Absolutely
And you're leading me

00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:27.230 align:middle line:90%
into what my discovery was.

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:29.270 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for that.

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:33.700 align:middle line:84%
For example, I was on that
energy concentric circle band

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:36.890 align:middle line:90%
and then I was not meditating.

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:40.030 align:middle line:84%
I was actually just sat
there but not meditating.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:44.340 align:middle line:84%
My eyes were open and my brain
suddenly went into delta.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:45.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: OK.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to be in a
meditative state at Avebury

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:51.470 align:middle line:90%
or Stonehenge.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:54.870 align:middle line:84%
You just have to be on
that megalithic energy band

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:56.920 align:middle line:90%
and you instantly go into delta.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Now that cannot be denied,
because I've got the results.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:01.570 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:02.563 align:middle line:90%
That's fascinating.

00:34:02.563 --> 00:34:04.230 align:middle line:84%
So once you were in
Delta state, did you

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:06.282 align:middle line:84%
use it for anything or
you just let it register

00:34:06.282 --> 00:34:07.115 align:middle line:90%
and that was enough?

00:34:07.115 --> 00:34:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: It was for
an experiment, really.

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:13.320 align:middle line:84%
But I did feel myself
almost entering

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.909 align:middle line:90%
into another part of Avebury.

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure if I stayed
there for a little bit longer,

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.258 align:middle line:84%
it's like being on
a portal taken--

00:34:20.258 --> 00:34:21.425 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Another dimension.

00:34:21.425 --> 00:34:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: Yes, taking
you somewhere else

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:26.370 align:middle line:84%
and your brain is naturally
put into that state

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:29.620 align:middle line:90%
without the need of meditation.

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:32.139 align:middle line:84%
So I think the people
that raise these stones,

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:35.460 align:middle line:84%
the elongated skull
people, they knew where

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:38.440 align:middle line:90%
to stand by a standing stone.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.239 align:middle line:90%
We go right up to stones.

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:43.020 align:middle line:84%
I take hundreds of people
to Avebury and Stonehenge

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and everybody wants
to hug a stone.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.929 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, everybody wants
to lean against a stone.

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:47.860 align:middle line:90%
And it's wonderful.

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:48.969 align:middle line:90%
And that's magical.

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:52.000 align:middle line:84%
But if they just walked
away from the stone,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.590 align:middle line:84%
imagine standing some
distance from it.

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:56.062 align:middle line:90%
That's where--

00:34:56.062 --> 00:34:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The power is.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.145 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: --The power is.

00:34:58.145 --> 00:35:00.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily
right by the stone.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And that sounds
counterintuitive,

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:03.700 align:middle line:90%
but that's what we've proved.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it has to
be some kind of interaction

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:09.050 align:middle line:84%
between the stones that's
creating that dynamic.

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:12.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you're right on a stone,
you're not getting that dynamic.

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:16.862 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, I keep thinking
about once Outlander came out,

00:35:16.862 --> 00:35:18.320 align:middle line:84%
and everybody's
watching Outlander.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.880 align:middle line:84%
It was a rage around the
Western world and beyond.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, thousands and
thousands of people

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:27.650 align:middle line:84%
started trying to seek out
any standing stone circle.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And so many people
must have been affected

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:34.450 align:middle line:84%
on an unconscious level by
just going to be there and play

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:37.090 align:middle line:84%
with it, hoping something
would happen, but actually

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:38.500 align:middle line:90%
not knowing.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And so you're
taking people there.

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.300 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I assume
you get special permission

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.570 align:middle line:84%
to go into Stonehenge because
it's well walled off now.

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:49.252 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not
accessible unless you--

00:35:49.252 --> 00:35:50.210 align:middle line:90%
What do you have to do?

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:51.170 align:middle line:90%
Do you have to go with a group?

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:52.945 align:middle line:84%
Do you have to get
advance permission?

00:35:52.945 --> 00:35:53.745 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:35:53.745 --> 00:35:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Absolutely.

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:55.580 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:59.020 align:middle line:84%
At Stonehenge, you have
to have private access

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:01.880 align:middle line:84%
and you have to apply for
that months in advance.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:04.400 align:middle line:90%
Some people say a month before.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.840 align:middle line:90%
Can you get me into Stonehenge?

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.190 align:middle line:90%
Highly unlikely.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:08.510 align:middle line:90%
You have to plan it.

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:11.170 align:middle line:84%
But the thing about
Stonehenge is where

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:13.070 align:middle line:90%
those stones have been worked.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:15.050 align:middle line:84%
What do I mean by
stones being worked?

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:18.940 align:middle line:84%
They've been made into that
rectangular lozenge shape.

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And some standing stones
aren't, but some at Avebury

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:26.930 align:middle line:84%
are carved to have
facial profiles, as well.

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you start to
literally tap stone,

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:34.130 align:middle line:84%
just like a sculpture, like a
mason, work in a piece of stone.

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:38.030 align:middle line:84%
It was found in the 1970s
with a Cambridge don.

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:40.240 align:middle line:84%
He literally was a
professor from Cambridge

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.880 align:middle line:84%
called Tom Lethbridge that
became a master dowser.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And he noticed, for example, if
a man worked a piece of stone

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:52.410 align:middle line:84%
and tapped it, it's like put in
a thermal shock into the stone.

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:55.250 align:middle line:84%
It registered his
bionic charge, that it

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:56.727 align:middle line:90%
was a male working, a male.

00:36:56.727 --> 00:36:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: And a
female, if she tapped it,

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:02.100 align:middle line:90%
he got his wife to do that.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:04.620 align:middle line:84%
But you have to put a
lot of energy into it.

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:07.860 align:middle line:84%
It registered a
female signature.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.010 align:middle line:84%
So what I did at
Stonehenge is I doused

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:13.130 align:middle line:84%
for all the bionic charges
of the standing stones

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:17.090 align:middle line:84%
at that site and the huge
inner trilithons, that's

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:20.610 align:middle line:84%
two stones with the standing
stone lintel on top.

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:22.080 align:middle line:90%
That's called a trilithon.

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.770 align:middle line:84%
They were worked by
women, so we have a lot

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:27.600 align:middle line:90%
of women masons with that.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.530 align:middle line:84%
But again, I mentioned
about microwaves being

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:34.350 align:middle line:90%
transduced from light to sound.

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's long been
thought that a standing

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:43.100 align:middle line:84%
stones in a lattice structure
is identical to a semiconductor

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:44.320 align:middle line:90%
from Silicon Valley.

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Love it.

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:46.165 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Oh, yeah.

00:37:46.165 --> 00:37:47.145 align:middle line:90%
They're identical.

00:37:47.145 --> 00:37:47.945 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:47.945 --> 00:37:50.480 align:middle line:84%
Now so if you place
those two side by side,

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.840 align:middle line:84%
they can have memory, like
you would have in your laptop.

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And they can record things
and produce things as well.

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:01.300 align:middle line:84%
So we think that if you're
programming these standing

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:05.560 align:middle line:84%
stones and you're really pushing
into that crystal lattice

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.860 align:middle line:84%
through thermal shock,
and every single standing

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:12.500 align:middle line:84%
stone at Stonehenge
has had thermal shock,

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.490 align:middle line:84%
then you can put
in an image to that

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:18.340 align:middle line:84%
or you can put in
your intent to that.

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a myth
that has been widely spoken

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:27.170 align:middle line:84%
about Stonehenge, and that's
every winter solstice,

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:31.280 align:middle line:84%
the great god Apollo leaves
his temple at Delphi.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.820 align:middle line:84%
That's a beautiful
temple in Greece

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.950 align:middle line:90%
and manifests at Stonehenge.

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And people could communicate
with the god Apollo.

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.390 align:middle line:84%
What I think is going
on there is the stones

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:46.410 align:middle line:84%
were programmed
like a bionic charge

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:49.030 align:middle line:84%
to have that image
of the healing god.

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Because every single
ancient calendar,

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:55.920 align:middle line:84%
called an almanac cog
of the British Isles

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.406 align:middle line:90%
records that Apollo manifests.

00:38:58.406 --> 00:38:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:00.260 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>WHEATLEY: So I think there was
a slight, fleeting image came

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:05.880 align:middle line:84%
out of the stones
at the same time

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:09.390 align:middle line:84%
the ultrasound was being
released and triggered

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:11.760 align:middle line:90%
by the light of the sun.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:16.450 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot more to stone
programming than meets the eye.

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I think
these stone circles have.

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:23.165 align:middle line:84%
I was Dolores Cannon's
guide for many, many years.

00:39:23.165 --> 00:39:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I loved her.

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:25.005 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Oh, yeah.

00:39:25.005 --> 00:39:27.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I worked with
Dolores for a long time,

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and I remember telling her
about stone programming,

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:34.020 align:middle line:84%
and she was in
agreement that she'd

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:38.460 align:middle line:84%
had some regressions
in her work that

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.490 align:middle line:84%
would kind of say a
similar thing to what

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:43.230 align:middle line:90%
I was talking can about.

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're
almost out of time,

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:48.120 align:middle line:84%
and I have so many more
things I want to ask you,

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.180 align:middle line:84%
but let's just do
this one little bit

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:51.360 align:middle line:90%
because we didn't get to it.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Silbury Hill in England
and Grave Creek Mound

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.660 align:middle line:90%
in West Virginia.

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit about
what these have in common,

00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:01.920 align:middle line:84%
and about the notion of working
with the moonlit landscape,

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:04.473 align:middle line:84%
because I know this also
has to do with Stonehenge as

00:40:04.473 --> 00:40:06.015 align:middle line:84%
much as you can say
in three minutes.

00:40:06.015 --> 00:40:06.815 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: OK.

00:40:06.815 --> 00:40:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, Silbury Hill is the
largest man-made mound

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:11.520 align:middle line:90%
in North West Europe.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And you have a very
similar monument

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.620 align:middle line:84%
in West Virginia
called Grave Creek.

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, we did some fantastic
experiments there.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.280 align:middle line:84%
I know that dowsing
can prove things.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.340 align:middle line:84%
So I was dowsing
there and said, this

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.750 align:middle line:84%
is coming out as
something quite good.

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:31.140 align:middle line:84%
If we could get the equipment to
prove my dowsing, which we got.

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So we were looking for
the electrostatic field

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.210 align:middle line:90%
on Silbury Hill.

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:38.160 align:middle line:84%
What's it like at the
top to the bottom.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:43.200 align:middle line:84%
It was 1,000 times greater
later at the top of mounds.

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.710 align:middle line:84%
OK, now if you imagine that
electrostatic field is going

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:49.090 align:middle line:84%
to build up and build
up and build up,

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:51.790 align:middle line:84%
then at night, if
that's indeed the case,

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:53.890 align:middle line:84%
and we proved it
with our results,

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:59.170 align:middle line:84%
it would have released a kind
of blue haze on the top of it.

00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:01.270 align:middle line:90%
It would have lit up the dark.

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:02.410 align:middle line:90%
These mounds.

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:07.290 align:middle line:10%
And more than that, there were
some people in the Avebury area

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:10.500 align:middle line:10%
that have photographed
this blue haze being

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.430 align:middle line:10%
emitted from Silbury Hill.

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So I think these ancient
mounds could light up the dark,

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:19.470 align:middle line:84%
and these are being stimulated
by the earth energies

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:24.060 align:middle line:84%
beneath them that are releasing
ions, negative ions, right

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.570 align:middle line:90%
the way up through the mound.

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And then you have this
spectacular light show

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.150 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient world.

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:32.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my.

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:34.420 align:middle line:84%
All of this is
absolutely fascinating.

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you have a
lot of people excited to do

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:39.390 align:middle line:90%
a spiritual journey, as tour.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And you do take people
on tours, right?

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:43.310 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to get
on in advance if you

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:44.820 align:middle line:90%
want to experience Stonehenge.

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:45.740 align:middle line:90%
It sounds like.

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:46.640 align:middle line:90%
How far out--?

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.920 align:middle line:84%
You're out probably a
year out or so on people

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.670 align:middle line:84%
signing up for your
Stonehenge tours.

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:51.840 align:middle line:90%
But it can be done right?

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:52.965 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Oh, absolutely.

00:41:52.965 --> 00:41:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And if I can get people
in at the last minute,

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:56.695 align:middle line:90%
I can try to do that as well.

00:41:56.695 --> 00:41:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, we
need to see if you

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:03.710 align:middle line:84%
can get some dig
going for that entity

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:05.520 align:middle line:84%
that you were talking
about earlier.

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:06.512 align:middle line:90%
It's all very exciting.

00:42:06.512 --> 00:42:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
your due diligence.

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.520 align:middle line:84%
You just literally keep
digging and digging

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.000 align:middle line:90%
and gathering more knowledge.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is quite a leap from
last time I spoke with you even.

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:16.740 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Maria.

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WHEATLEY: Thank you.

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely
fascinating.

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:24.060 align:middle line:10%

This woman never stops.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:27.090 align:middle line:10%
It's always going
to be exciting.
