00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.180 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Cate Montana
is a woman after my own heart.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.980 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.770 align:middle line:10%
Because she believes
humanity is essentially good,

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.430 align:middle line:10%
that we know how to love.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.070 align:middle line:84%
But there are
ancient forces that

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.820 align:middle line:84%
have attempted to separate
us from our true essence.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.830 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be talking about
that and recovering our true

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.830 align:middle line:84%
nature in her book,
"Cracking the Matrix."

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.490 align:middle line:90%
So good to see you again, Cate.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>> CATE MONTANA: It's
so good to be back.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.658 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You were supposed
to be here a while back,

00:00:42.658 --> 00:00:45.030 align:middle line:84%
except you got COVID, you
couldn't get on the plane.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.930 align:middle line:90%
But here we are.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.888 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: And then I
got sick a few days ago.

00:00:47.888 --> 00:00:50.250 align:middle line:10%
There has been a lot
of pushback from,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.933 align:middle line:10%
shall we say, interdimensional
influences that doesn't want me

00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.225 align:middle line:10%
here and have this conversation

00:00:54.225 --> 00:00:55.630 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: They don't want you
to talk about how good we are.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.670 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: No, no.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.221 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:01.170 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh, OK, so you're--

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.650 align:middle line:90%
I've interviewed you before.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.110 align:middle line:84%
So people can go
into the archive

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.740 align:middle line:90%
and see our original interview.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.850 align:middle line:84%
But you've had kind
of-- you've had

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.210 align:middle line:84%
a really wonderful,
wild kind of life

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.530 align:middle line:84%
because you just go,
do what you want to do.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.660 align:middle line:90%
Then you just go out of control.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:84%
Then you go back to yourself
and the great creator,

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.945 align:middle line:84%
and then you're back on the
road again with something else.

00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And so you've been like
this your whole life, which

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.002 align:middle line:84%
has given you a lot of exposure
to the nature of humanity.

00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: Yeah,
a lot of context.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.627 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A lot of context.

00:01:32.627 --> 00:01:34.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to your
youth and things that

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.430 align:middle line:84%
started with your grandmother
when you were around 7 years

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.230 align:middle line:90%
old even.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.250 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
dive in because we

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.292 align:middle line:90%
have a lot to chat about.

00:01:40.292 --> 00:01:41.530 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Sure.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've already talked
about how unconscious I was.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.397 align:middle line:90%
I just bought the program.

00:01:46.397 --> 00:01:47.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Like everybody.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Like everybody.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.437 align:middle line:84%
And I believed what
the church said.

00:01:50.437 --> 00:01:51.770 align:middle line:90%
I believed what my parents said.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.060 align:middle line:90%
I believed what school said.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And so here's life, five
senses and that's all there is.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.960 align:middle line:90%
And believe what everybody says.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.540 align:middle line:10%
And so I was completely unaware
of all these other influences

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.000 align:middle line:10%
that were guiding
my family, that

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.009 align:middle line:10%
were infiltrating my family,
that were infiltrating me,

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.420 align:middle line:10%
negative forces.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.370 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother had
Parkinson's disease.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.560 align:middle line:90%
She was a very selfish woman.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And she slowly just became like
a frozen statue of salt. I mean,

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.110 align:middle line:84%
she couldn't talk,
she couldn't walk.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.740 align:middle line:84%
But I would see things
behind her eyes.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.640 align:middle line:84%
There was something
there that I recognized

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.678 align:middle line:84%
as a very young child,
that as I grew older,

00:02:33.678 --> 00:02:35.470 align:middle line:84%
it was just like, well,
that's just grandma

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.440 align:middle line:90%
and that's how she is.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And I stopped seeing what
was behind the eyes, what

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.950 align:middle line:90%
was behind the visage.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And so it wasn't until I started
writing Cracking the Matrix,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.890 align:middle line:84%
when COVID hit and I got out of
my spirituality bubble and went,

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.330 align:middle line:84%
wait a minute, 30,000 hours of
meditation and all this inner

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.790 align:middle line:84%
work, and look at the
world is going to hell.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.530 align:middle line:90%
What is happening?

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm missing something.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And that was when I
stopped and I went,

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.650 align:middle line:84%
OK, I've got to include the
whole picture of life, not just

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:90%
the light side.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.550 align:middle line:84%
I need the full spectrum
of what's going on.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And when I started asking full
spectrum information, please,

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.740 align:middle line:84%
that's when people,
situations and memories

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.430 align:middle line:84%
started coming forward
of that I had already met

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.560 align:middle line:90%
these interdimensional beings.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.680 align:middle line:90%
I had already seen them.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:84%
I saw them behind my
grandmother's eyes.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
I saw them in the pain of
my grandfather, in his tears

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.910 align:middle line:90%
at night.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.830 align:middle line:84%
I saw what was driving the
numbness and the alcoholism

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.060 align:middle line:90%
in my family.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.360 align:middle line:90%
Kids are smart.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.317 align:middle line:90%
You said it earlier.

00:03:42.317 --> 00:03:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Kids are smart.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: Five years old, you
know what the heck is going on.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it's funny.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.200 align:middle line:84%
I've got a super
open mind, but when

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.780 align:middle line:84%
I hear something that's BS, even
when I was a little tiny one,

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle line:84%
it's like, that
doesn't work for me.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm done.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of here.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.560 align:middle line:84%
But at each point in
someone's-- each of our lives,

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.900 align:middle line:84%
there has to come that
moment where we say, no,

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.880 align:middle line:90%
I don't buy it.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, your family was just
drowning in all this sorrow

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:90%
and numbing it with alcohol.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.282 align:middle line:84%
You had your own little
play with alcohol yourself.

00:04:12.282 --> 00:04:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Absolutely.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.653 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:04:15.653 --> 00:04:18.070 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: It was all part
of the program to keep me numb

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.467 align:middle line:90%
and on track, whatever that--

00:04:20.467 --> 00:04:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: On track.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.330 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: On track, the
social, get a good education,

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.710 align:middle line:84%
start a career, marry right,
get a 401(k), buy a dog,

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.790 align:middle line:84%
buy a house, get a
mortgage, take the pills.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I say throw
those magazines out.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: So I was
on the success parade.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.235 align:middle line:84%
And until I hit 30 and I had
a great career in television,

00:04:41.235 --> 00:04:43.360 align:middle line:84%
I had the house, I had the
mortgage, I had the dog,

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.280 align:middle line:84%
I had the foreign
cars, the husband.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And none of it was
making me happy.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, well,
I've done everything

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.360 align:middle line:84%
that society told me
to do to be happy.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm not happy.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.510 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is left?

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I think everybody
listening to this can relate

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.230 align:middle line:90%
to that.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.170 align:middle line:84%
They've been there at one
point, or if they're not

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.960 align:middle line:90%
there right now.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yeah.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.620 align:middle line:84%
So the only other
path was inward.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.430 align:middle line:84%
So then there's
another 35, 40 years

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.865 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual indoctrination,
spiritual programming.

00:05:11.865 --> 00:05:13.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's
talk about that.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.367 align:middle line:84%
You had a romp with
Ramtha, JZ Knight.

00:05:16.367 --> 00:05:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Oh, god.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I did.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.070 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.740 align:middle line:84%
That was a channeled teaching
back in the '80s when everybody

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.140 align:middle line:90%
was channeling.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Everyone
was channeling.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.500 align:middle line:84%
That's when all the channels
that you hear about today

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.000 align:middle line:90%
really started first popping up.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.800 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yeah.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But at the same time,
you also went into seclusion

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.448 align:middle line:90%
after your television career.

00:05:31.448 --> 00:05:33.240 align:middle line:84%
We talked about this
in the last interview.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.080 align:middle line:84%
You went to a little cabin,
and you sat with yourself

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.870 align:middle line:84%
to feel yourself
for a few years.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.240 align:middle line:90%
What happened during that time?

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Because people dream of having
a getaway from life like that.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.820 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yeah.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:84%
That was the 30
kind of break point,

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Saturn return, oh, my
God, it's not working.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.890 align:middle line:90%
So I turned within.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.852 align:middle line:84%
I rented a cabin
for $100 a month.

00:05:53.852 --> 00:05:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What did you do with
the husband and everything?

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: I divorced.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: I left television,
and I took my dogs and my cat

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and my horse and went
and lived in the woods.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.010 align:middle line:90%
And I had no teachers, no guide.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.940 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know
the word astral.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.220 align:middle line:84%
I could spell "spiritual,"
but that's about it.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.560 align:middle line:84%
But I just asked the
question, who am I?

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.690 align:middle line:84%
That just seemed
to me the question.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And I would meditate probably
six, seven hours a day,

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.150 align:middle line:84%
in the morning
and then at night.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.342 align:middle line:90%
And-- [CHUCKLES]

00:06:22.342 --> 00:06:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Did you get
any answers, by the way?

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Oh god.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, it was a--

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.425 align:middle line:84%
well, I got a really good look
at how my mind functioned.

00:06:28.425 --> 00:06:30.425 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, oh my
God, what an unholy mess.

00:06:30.425 --> 00:06:32.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:90%
It was a disaster.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my head was
a disaster place.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.630 align:middle line:84%
But after about six months
of continued effort,

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.200 align:middle line:84%
I started to-- yeah, I had a
moment where I fell into bliss.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.490 align:middle line:84%
It was just one of those
holistic, whole moments

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.440 align:middle line:90%
where everything made sense.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.680 align:middle line:84%
I knew who I was
but not in a linear,

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.060 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm Cate Montana,
none of that.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.200 align:middle line:84%
All that went away, and there
was just this quiet certitude.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And that was when I knew I was
on the right path, that that was

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.430 align:middle line:84%
a moment of connection
to my true being

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.990 align:middle line:84%
that I probably
hadn't experienced

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.110 align:middle line:90%
since I was an infant.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.370 align:middle line:84%
That made me know I
was on the right path.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.280 align:middle line:90%
So it was after that--

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How did you leap
over to Ramtha and all?

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:18.665 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: How was--

00:07:18.665 --> 00:07:20.082 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: No,
that was JZ Knight,

00:07:20.082 --> 00:07:21.210 align:middle line:90%
big channeler in the '80s.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: OK, OK.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.430 align:middle line:84%
So the next thing that
happened in this meditation

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.810 align:middle line:84%
is that I started having
out-of-body experiences.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.510 align:middle line:84%
I obviously opened up
my Kundalini energy,

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.000 align:middle line:90%
and I started actually having--

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.260 align:middle line:84%
I started having
astral experiences.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.510 align:middle line:84%
I started having attacks from
interdimensional beings that I

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.090 align:middle line:84%
didn't know were
interdimensional beings.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.570 align:middle line:84%
I literally could feel hands on
my body pulling my spirit out

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.700 align:middle line:84%
of my body at night,
and I was thrown

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.050 align:middle line:84%
into astral hell realms that
were just, well, terrifying.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.840 align:middle line:84%
Every horror movie,
every "Exorcist"

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.110 align:middle line:84%
movie you've ever seen,
that was the vibe.

00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.910 align:middle line:90%
It was awful.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:00.930 align:middle line:90%
I was terrified.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.610 align:middle line:90%
I was terrified.

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.850 align:middle line:90%
And I had no context, Regina.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.500 align:middle line:84%
I had no teacher, no books,
couldn't spell "astral."

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.480 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And so I had just completed my
master's degree in psychology.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.720 align:middle line:84%
I called my ex-advisor at
the college and I said,

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.520 align:middle line:90%
I need a shrink.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.395 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: [CHUCKLES]

00:08:17.395 --> 00:08:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: And so he sent me
some recommendations in Atlanta,

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and I ended up on a
psychiatrist couch.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.088 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What did
they find in that head?

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.797 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: And so I
told him about my visions

00:08:28.797 --> 00:08:31.490 align:middle line:84%
and my out-of-body experiences,
and it was like this wonderful

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:35.780 align:middle line:84%
hour of purging at $250
an hour back in 1986.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, well,
that's pretty good.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And he thought I
was schizophrenic.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.000 align:middle line:84%
So the diagnosis at that
point was like, boy,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.080 align:middle line:90%
are you screwed up.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And I remember at
that moment, it

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.490 align:middle line:84%
was a break point because I
realized I wasn't screwed up.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:50.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: The outside
program was telling me.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.090 align:middle line:90%
I was sick.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:55.550 align:middle line:90%
I knew I was not.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I ran
across a psychologist

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.950 align:middle line:90%
who was totally tuned in.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And she went, oh, you
cracked your Kundalini.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.950 align:middle line:84%
It's unusual, but yeah,
there's an explanation

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:08.960 align:middle line:90%
for what you're doing.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.892 align:middle line:84%
At that point, she had
a video conference.

00:09:11.892 --> 00:09:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And a whole bunch of people came
over and watched her Ramtha tape

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.430 align:middle line:84%
one night, and that was
how I got to Ramtha.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.717 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you were alive and
you were doing the spiritual

00:09:20.717 --> 00:09:23.300 align:middle line:84%
path, the new age path in the
'80s, you usually found your way

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.630 align:middle line:90%
to some channel or another.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I did.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.260 align:middle line:84%
I think most of us did if
you were in an area that

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.218 align:middle line:90%
had that sort of thing.

00:09:29.218 --> 00:09:30.018 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yeah.

00:09:30.018 --> 00:09:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so
now let's talk--

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.990 align:middle line:84%
but let's go back a little bit
because this does feed into it.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.170 align:middle line:84%
You enjoyed alcohol to numb
yourself along the way.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, what periods of your
life were you using alcohol

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:41.680 align:middle line:90%
to numb yourself?

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Because this also creates
such an incredible porousness

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.600 align:middle line:84%
in the aura that anything
can come in uninvited.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.920 align:middle line:84%
So did that just weave in
and out here and there?

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.350 align:middle line:90%
Or was it--

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: Well, most spiritual
teachers of any credibility will

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.590 align:middle line:84%
advise people against
substances, whether it's drugs,

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:02.550 align:middle line:90%
alcohol.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I would quit for a few
years and then go back to it.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And so it was on again, off
again, kind of a love affair.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So did it disrupt
your ability to continue this

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.220 align:middle line:90%
journey of knowing thyself?

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Or did you do--

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.320 align:middle line:84%
were you able to work
it out even with that?

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.050 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: Well, I guess I
wouldn't be sitting here talking

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.675 align:middle line:84%
to you if I hadn't
worked it through.

00:10:27.675 --> 00:10:28.475 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:10:28.475 --> 00:10:32.360 align:middle line:84%
But in retrospect,
yeah, of course.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.740 align:middle line:84%
But I think we come to what we
can come to when we can come

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.940 align:middle line:90%
to it and not a moment before.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And I have argued in my own
head against the process,

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.150 align:middle line:84%
the evolutionary
journey of growth

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.170 align:middle line:84%
because it should all be
aligned and instantaneous,

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.026 align:middle line:84%
and I should know
it all right now.

00:10:50.026 --> 00:10:51.403 align:middle line:90%
That's the delusion.

00:10:51.403 --> 00:10:52.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, exactly.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.353 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: And so
one step at a time.

00:10:55.353 --> 00:10:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until the
whole COVID adventure

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.890 align:middle line:84%
and, again, when I started
to embrace a full spectrum

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:04.360 align:middle line:84%
view of my life, the
context of how humanity

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.050 align:middle line:90%
has gotten to the pickle point.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.750 align:middle line:90%
It's at now where we're divided.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:09.800 align:middle line:90%
We're contentious.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.120 align:middle line:90%
We're in total conflict.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.040 align:middle line:90%
We hate ourselves.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're
trying to numb ourselves.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.020 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: And we're
numbing ourselves.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: One way or another.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: And so it was
finally when I saw that we are

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:23.770 align:middle line:84%
being assiduously influenced and
programmed by this presence that

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:27.860 align:middle line:84%
is interdimensional,
invisible by its very nature.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you call it,
essentially, an anti-life force.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: I do.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.602 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I've talked
with many authors and people

00:11:33.602 --> 00:11:36.170 align:middle line:84%
on the show that
speak about "it."

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:40.760 align:middle line:84%
But some people will
say "it" is reptilians.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Other people will say
it's interdimensional.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Others will say it's
aspects of your own mind.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.430 align:middle line:84%
But for you, for all
of us, actually, I

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.110 align:middle line:84%
think we all understand
there's something here

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.640 align:middle line:84%
that from the hierarchical
top-down level, which is BS

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.475 align:middle line:84%
anyway, is putting out
reflections of humanity that

00:12:01.475 --> 00:12:02.275 align:middle line:90%
aren't us.

00:12:02.275 --> 00:12:03.075 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yeah.

00:12:03.075 --> 00:12:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Way too much
violence, just scarcity,

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:08.660 align:middle line:90%
lack control, competition.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.220 align:middle line:90%
That's not us.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.270 align:middle line:90%
That is not us.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And so that's your
journey, and that's

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.200 align:middle line:84%
what you did in
writing this book.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.690 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
some of those,

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.030 align:middle line:84%
where you start really seeing
these influences coming in.

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: It was during COVID
years when I started to reflect

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.390 align:middle line:84%
and go, what's wrong
with this planet?

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And why, after 30,000
hours of meditation,

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:34.190 align:middle line:84%
am I still conflicted and
still filled with self-doubt?

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Why is my only
escape with my eyes

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.200 align:middle line:84%
closed sitting on
my zazen pillow?

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.025 align:middle line:90%
Why is that my only free place?

00:12:42.025 --> 00:12:42.825 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:12:42.825 --> 00:12:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: And so--

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's a
very good question.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: It is.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:46.030 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.363 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You should be
living that while you're awake.

00:12:48.363 --> 00:12:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Exactly, embodied.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: So that's when
I started looking at this

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:57.260 align:middle line:84%
influence, and I traced it
back thousands of years.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.650 align:middle line:84%
There's not a culture or a
civilization on this planet,

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Regina, that doesn't know about
this interdimensional negative,

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.210 align:middle line:90%
entropic, anti-life influence.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.640 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Greeks
called it the-- called

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.730 align:middle line:90%
these beings the Archons.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yeah.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:17.350 align:middle line:84%
The Native Americans call this
influence wetiko or wendigo.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.890 align:middle line:84%
I live in Hawaii, and the
kahunas refer to these beings

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.975 align:middle line:90%
as the e'epa.

00:13:22.975 --> 00:13:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung called it the
Antichrist influence

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.820 align:middle line:90%
or the antimimos.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And it just blew my
mind that, wow, OK--

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.670 align:middle line:84%
well, of course,
Christians call it Satan.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's like,
well, wait a minute.

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.990 align:middle line:84%
We've known about this influence
for thousands of years.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.650 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knows about it.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:45.640 align:middle line:84%
The shamans that I did plant
medicine with in the Amazon

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.540 align:middle line:84%
dealt with these
beings all the time.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:51.755 align:middle line:84%
Very, very clear that
this presence is here now.

00:13:51.755 --> 00:13:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Always has been.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.797 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: Always has
been, across the board,

00:13:54.797 --> 00:13:55.810 align:middle line:90%
affects everybody.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't care how many thousands
of hours of meditation

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.450 align:middle line:90%
and how much yoga you've done.

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:01.280 align:middle line:90%
We are all affected.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.870 align:middle line:90%
And we don't see it.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.840 align:middle line:90%
That's why we're affected.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.782 align:middle line:84%
And so the next question
became is, well, if it's here,

00:14:07.782 --> 00:14:09.490 align:middle line:84%
everybody knows about
it, and everybody's

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:13.030 align:middle line:84%
known about it forever,
why don't we know about it?

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.070 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
next question about,

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:20.810 align:middle line:84%
how are we programmed to keep
this presence invisible so

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:23.040 align:middle line:84%
that we don't know
what's really going on?

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And we are always
blaming ourselves,

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:31.332 align:middle line:84%
and we're taking all the
credit for all the bad stuff

00:14:31.332 --> 00:14:35.400 align:middle line:84%
and completely ignoring that
there is this constant yin, yin,

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.200 align:middle line:90%
yin, yin, yin.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.930 align:middle line:84%
You know the whole little
devil on your shoulder image?

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:42.500 align:middle line:84%
It's really true,
and we don't give it

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.720 align:middle line:84%
credit, because, all
right, Christianity,

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.218 align:middle line:90%
religion has made this--

00:14:47.218 --> 00:14:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Born a sinner.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: --born a sinner.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.970 align:middle line:84%
The whole influence
is about original sin

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and that we are rotten to
the core by the very fact

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.180 align:middle line:84%
that we dwell in these
beautiful bodies.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:04.400 align:middle line:84%
So there is this setup from
the get-go that tells us that,

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.240 align:middle line:90%
this I cannot trust.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.130 align:middle line:90%
I cannot trust my own heart.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:09.750 align:middle line:90%
I cannot trust my own guidance.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.040 align:middle line:90%
Only God is good.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.420 align:middle line:90%
Only God is love.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And I have to strive to
gain that that's already

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.580 align:middle line:90%
outside of me.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That
approval and help.

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: That approval.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.200 align:middle line:90%
And so there's this gap.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Goodness and love is out
here, and so I'm down here

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.560 align:middle line:90%
as this miserable sinner.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And there's this yin, yin,
yin, yeah you're right.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you're a piece of poo,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And we don't give it credit
because, well, look at what--

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:37.300 align:middle line:84%
look at how religion,
Christianity, for example,

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.140 align:middle line:84%
treats-- well,
Satan is ludicrous.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:44.650 align:middle line:84%
The bug-eyed monster with
the horns and a tail--

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:46.030 align:middle line:90%
anybody in the 21st--

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:48.488 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --start programming
you when you're three, four,

00:15:48.488 --> 00:15:49.480 align:middle line:90%
and five, it's real.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:49.755 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yeah.

00:15:49.755 --> 00:15:50.555 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:50.555 --> 00:15:55.030 align:middle line:84%
But when you move into more
rational scientific perspective,

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.130 align:middle line:84%
and people tend to go,
well, that's ridiculous.

00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:59.540 align:middle line:90%
So we marginalize it.

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:00.707 align:middle line:90%
We sideline it.

00:16:00.707 --> 00:16:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, what's
interesting is so then we moved,

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.480 align:middle line:84%
as humanity, away from
religion and superstition,

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.290 align:middle line:84%
to a large extent, into a
world of scientific materialism

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.950 align:middle line:84%
and mentalism and mind and away
from the spiritual tenants,

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:16.667 align:middle line:84%
controlling tenants
as well, right?

00:16:16.667 --> 00:16:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Exactly.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So now you have--

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.050 align:middle line:84%
when I was young, pretty
much everyone I knew

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:24.790 align:middle line:84%
went to church, one
kind or another.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:28.540 align:middle line:84%
That's gone by the
by, to a large extent,

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.090 align:middle line:84%
in the Western
industrialized world.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And with it-- I mean, on
one hand, you can say,

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:35.930 align:middle line:90%
people were pretty good.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:39.530 align:middle line:84%
We didn't see-- we weren't doing
heinous things to each other.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.180 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have these same
kind of dark, obvious media

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.577 align:middle line:90%
influences in those days.

00:16:44.577 --> 00:16:45.660 align:middle line:90%
It was quite the opposite.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.325 align:middle line:90%
It was very moralistic.

00:16:46.325 --> 00:16:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: We had Opie.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.258 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We had Opie.

00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:49.860 align:middle line:90%
We had "Father Knows Best."

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.230 align:middle line:90%
It should have been mother, too.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:52.573 align:middle line:90%
Father and mother know best.

00:16:52.573 --> 00:16:54.330 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] We had all that.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So then something else
happened, and that's

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:02.420 align:middle line:84%
the part we're leaning into
now, which is something now--

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:06.380 align:middle line:84%
the influence that's coming
from this hierarchical media

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.569 align:middle line:84%
structure don't
match who we are.

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:09.500 align:middle line:90%
We're good.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.300 align:middle line:84%
They don't match the goodness
that's inside us at all.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me this might
be one of the last big grasps

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.560 align:middle line:90%
for human consciousness.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.640 align:middle line:84%
Whatever beings are
perpetuating this,

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.150 align:middle line:84%
must know the game
is winding down as

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.800 align:middle line:84%
these new, little,
fresh babies awaken.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.170 align:middle line:90%
They have so much knowledge.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:32.190 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.720 align:middle line:84%
That's not going to be--
they're not going to buy it.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.690 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the ways
in which it's still happening.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.670 align:middle line:84%
One of them you bring up in
your book is the Super Bowl.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:40.922 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Oh, dear heaven.

00:17:40.922 --> 00:17:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I thought,
are you kidding me?

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: Really, guys and
jockstraps and demons rising out

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.340 align:middle line:90%
of hell as--

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Zombies and jocks--

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: Zombies
and jockstraps.

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:50.095 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --were
over their faces.

00:17:50.095 --> 00:17:51.305 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: Jockstraps
over their faces.

00:17:51.305 --> 00:17:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, come on.

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:56.240 align:middle line:90%
How much lower can we get?

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.830 align:middle line:84%
How many millions of citizens
of this planet watch that?

00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:59.630 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Sure.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And we're taught
that it's acceptable.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.320 align:middle line:90%
This is art.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: [CHUCKLES]

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.840 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: And so there's
this constant push,

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:12.440 align:middle line:84%
this program that demeans
us that has these negative

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:16.400 align:middle line:84%
influences that show us the
lowest common denominator

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.300 align:middle line:90%
possible.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And then we're taught it's art,
and then the critics go wild.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And so we're all like,
well, OK, that must be.

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:23.623 align:middle line:90%
So we accept it.

00:18:23.623 --> 00:18:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's a
big one right there.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Just form, color, and
what is called art.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:32.120 align:middle line:84%
I remember reading "Newsweek"
magazine quite a few years ago,

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.650 align:middle line:84%
and I saw what looked like
a pile of poo on a canvas.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Mm-hmm.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:35.730 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That was at the
Tate Museum in London, right?

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:38.670 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yeah.

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.137 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And I thought, how
come I don't understand this?

00:18:41.137 --> 00:18:42.845 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: A
five-year-old understands--

00:18:42.845 --> 00:18:43.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A five-year-old.

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.900 align:middle line:84%
But I've grown up a little,
and I didn't understand.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise I would have said,
well, that's poo on a canvas.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:48.890 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yeah.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so that's the
stuff that's being elevated.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: The message
is constant across--

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:58.100 align:middle line:84%
when I realize that the message
from society, from religion,

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.920 align:middle line:84%
and from spirituality
was all the same message,

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.160 align:middle line:90%
you're not enough.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: You do not know.

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Look for answers
outside of yourself.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:12.110 align:middle line:84%
You are a debased,
violent conflict, greedy--

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:15.420 align:middle line:90%
You are a low spectrum being.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.180 align:middle line:84%
That's the constant
message across the board.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.730 align:middle line:84%
Society is like, you
have to be thinner.

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:21.900 align:middle line:90%
You have to be richer.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.430 align:middle line:90%
You have to be prettier.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.140 align:middle line:90%
You have to be more successful.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.440 align:middle line:90%
You have to be more and more.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Religion is well, you
have to be more holy.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.650 align:middle line:90%
You have to be more pure.

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:35.070 align:middle line:84%
You have to be more
surrendered to God.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality-- you have
to be more your higher

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:40.890 align:middle line:90%
self, more of your Christ self.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:43.740 align:middle line:90%
You have to be more forgiving.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:46.790 align:middle line:84%
You have to be more
open-minded, more, more, more,

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:49.820 align:middle line:90%
not, who are you?

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.320 align:middle line:90%
You're a being of love.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.700 align:middle line:84%
You're a spirit being
of love already.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And it just hit me
between the eyes, Regina.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:01.150 align:middle line:84%
It's like, wait a minute,
the message constantly

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.380 align:middle line:84%
from every direction is
you've got to be more.

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:04.180 align:middle line:90%
You're not enough.

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.055 align:middle line:90%
You're bad and wrong.

00:20:05.055 --> 00:20:07.652 align:middle line:90%
You're incomplete.

00:20:07.652 --> 00:20:09.630 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:13.990 align:middle line:84%
How can I become
what I already am?

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:17.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm already a being
of light and love.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.670 align:middle line:90%
We all are.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.990 align:middle line:90%
How can I become that?

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.610 align:middle line:84%
I already am, but
I can be sidelined.

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:27.940 align:middle line:84%
I can be steered astray
and think I'm less

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.050 align:middle line:84%
and have to become
something more.

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.970 align:middle line:84%
So then I'm always seeking
answers outside of self.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:37.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm always seeking
love outside of self.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm always seeking the
light outside of self.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So to come back in and
go, oh my God, I mean,

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:45.460 align:middle line:90%
what a journey to come back in.

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm already here.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:52.270 align:middle line:84%
I already know the simplest,
most original teaching ever.

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:middle line:90%
Be still.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.380 align:middle line:90%
Know you are God.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we're going to
get into some of the things that

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:00.700 align:middle line:84%
happen once you realize,
it's all right here.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: It's all
right here right now.

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:02.945 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
all here already.

00:21:02.945 --> 00:21:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And your body is the
most divine tuning fork.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:06.730 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yes.

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But let's talk about
something else conceptually

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:09.340 align:middle line:90%
first.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yeah.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so there's nobody
here that's been forced to be

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.660 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.283 align:middle line:90%
Incarnation is not an accident.

00:21:18.283 --> 00:21:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: [CHUCKLES]

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So we're here.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.690 align:middle line:84%
You can't stuff a-- and I
say this, and I mean it.

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:24.540 align:middle line:84%
You can't stuff
a soul in a body.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.950 align:middle line:90%
Soul will say, no, I'm leaving.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:27.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do this.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:28.770 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.750 align:middle line:90%
It's easy to leave a body.

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:36.300 align:middle line:84%
So if we've all agreed to
be here in this matrix,

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.510 align:middle line:84%
after everything that you
have seen and been through

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and the place you've
come to, you've

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.530 align:middle line:90%
become a stronger, wiser person.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:48.850 align:middle line:84%
But we see incredible cruelty
in the lowest framework

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:49.692 align:middle line:90%
of humanity--

00:21:49.692 --> 00:21:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Absolutely.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:51.567 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --emotions.

00:21:51.567 --> 00:21:58.180 align:middle line:84%
So if this is known as the
planet of polarity of extremes,

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.690 align:middle line:84%
isn't that inherently, all that
stuff's supposed to be there,

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.420 align:middle line:90%
too?

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.300 align:middle line:90%
It's a tough one.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: That's
one interpretation.

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: It goes back to
the whole yin-yang symbol.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:17.200 align:middle line:84%
We have been trained to see
it as a conflict of opposites,

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Black and white, up and
down, male and female.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.060 align:middle line:90%
That's this planet.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.300 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a whole.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.330 align:middle line:90%
It's a complementary.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:31.000 align:middle line:84%
The yin-yang is complementary
forces that are innate

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.610 align:middle line:84%
in a whole that
cannot be separated.

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:37.870 align:middle line:84%
So the illusion and the matrix
and the message in the matrix

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.430 align:middle line:84%
is that it's always
about opposites.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And so the more we're-- we're
always trained to see the other,

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:47.800 align:middle line:84%
and we're trained to see
the other as dangerous.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.925 align:middle line:84%
And we're trained to see the
other as outside of ourselves.

00:22:51.925 --> 00:22:54.310 align:middle line:84%
In my book, "The
E-Word," it was like,

00:22:54.310 --> 00:23:02.560 align:middle line:84%
I realized as a tiny infant the
immediate nonverbal impression

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.160 align:middle line:84%
24/7 from my senses is,
oh, Regina's over there.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.970 align:middle line:90%
Mommy's breast is out there.

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:09.370 align:middle line:90%
I've got to cry the--

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:14.770 align:middle line:84%
so we are trained from infancy
to, yes, OK, self and other.

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:15.670 align:middle line:90%
And then--

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That we
are interdependent.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: Yeah, but we
lose that message that

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.010 align:middle line:90%
we're interdependent.

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Then that message comes
in and says yeah, well,

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.270 align:middle line:90%
that other is dangerous.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to manipulate
that other to get what you want,

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:33.970 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to be supreme
over the other and be somebody.

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:35.200 align:middle line:90%
How can I be somebody?

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.120 align:middle line:10%
I already am this
beautiful being of love,

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.240 align:middle line:10%
unless I get the message that
there's this carrot out here

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.802 align:middle line:10%
always dangling down the road
with the rabbit chasing--

00:23:44.802 --> 00:23:46.760 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Well, do you
think that it is, then,

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.760 align:middle line:10%
because we all here
incarnated now,

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.740 align:middle line:10%
part of our journey to have the
wisdom and discernment to say

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:52.540 align:middle line:10%
no?

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Absolutely.

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean,
it seems to me,

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:55.550 align:middle line:84%
that's really what
this is about.

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:59.050 align:middle line:84%
The darker it gets, the
darker the push and pull

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:00.910 align:middle line:84%
and influences, the
more institutions

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:02.840 align:middle line:84%
become wobbly and
start crumbling.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:08.430 align:middle line:84%
It's-- we're here now to say,
OK, OK, I chose to be here now.

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:09.630 align:middle line:90%
The answer is, no.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:11.787 align:middle line:84%
I'm not buying your
version of reality anymore.

00:24:11.787 --> 00:24:12.870 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Exactly right.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:16.580 align:middle line:84%
We've got to see the whole
picture at one point.

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:20.270 align:middle line:84%
I would love to tell a
story about original sin

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:22.257 align:middle line:84%
because it's the
story of programming.

00:24:22.257 --> 00:24:23.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, please do.

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.875 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: This is how this
interdimensional force works,

00:24:25.875 --> 00:24:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and it's been working
for thousands of years.

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Like this.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:30.230 align:middle line:90%
But this is so telling.

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look in a
baby's eyes for 15 seconds,

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.550 align:middle line:84%
you see nothing but pure
life, love, expansion.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, anybody looking in
a baby's eyes for 15 seconds

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:44.733 align:middle line:90%
knows that original sin is BS.

00:24:44.733 --> 00:24:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely, yeah.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: So where
did this come from?

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:49.410 align:middle line:84%
OK, so it comes
from St. Augustine.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:52.195 align:middle line:84%
He introduced it at the Council
of Nicaea and wa, da, da, da,

00:24:52.195 --> 00:24:52.995 align:middle line:90%
da.

00:24:52.995 --> 00:24:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Where did St. Augustine
get this picture?

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out
that St. Augustine

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.250 align:middle line:90%
was a sexual reprobate.

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:00.960 align:middle line:90%
His mom was Christian.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.440 align:middle line:90%
His dad was a pagan.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.908 align:middle line:84%
He was a drunk and a sex
fiend for the first 25 years--

00:25:06.908 --> 00:25:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Like a lot
of our church elders.

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.533 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: Like a lot
of our church elders.

00:25:10.533 --> 00:25:13.050 align:middle line:90%
And his mother despaired.

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:16.110 align:middle line:84%
He ran across the
teachings of Mani,

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:19.170 align:middle line:84%
the prophet of
Babylon, Manichaeism,

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:21.780 align:middle line:84%
that taught that
the body is sinful.

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.580 align:middle line:90%
The body will lead you into sin.

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:24.380 align:middle line:90%
The body is--

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
a conflicted, man.

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: [CHUCKLES]
The body is corrupt.

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole thing is to
get out of the body to God,

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:32.040 align:middle line:90%
and then you can be good.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And so St. Augustine took
this teaching of Manichaeism,

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.180 align:middle line:84%
was like, that's
why I'm a bad boy.

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:42.060 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm breaking
my mommy's heart.

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:43.470 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES] I get it.

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:47.640 align:middle line:84%
It's my body's
fault. Sinful thing.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.440 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's where he got
the original sin thing.

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:55.290 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, is where did
Mani, the prophet of Babylon--

00:25:55.290 --> 00:26:02.220 align:middle line:84%
back in 235 AD, where did Mani
get the idea about original sin?

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, turns out that
Mani had a voice that

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:09.090 align:middle line:84%
would speak to him,
an invisible being

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:12.330 align:middle line:84%
that he called his other self,
that would whisper in his ear

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.250 align:middle line:84%
about the corruption
of the flesh

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:16.350 align:middle line:84%
and how nature was
not to be trusted

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and how the body was to
be despised and reviled,

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:27.592 align:middle line:84%
and how we were born into sin
by being here on planet Earth.

00:26:27.592 --> 00:26:29.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Isn't it amazing
how many of these, quote,

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.560 align:middle line:84%
"great books and great works"
were based on really corrupted

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.540 align:middle line:90%
channeling?

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: You get this.

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:36.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's exactly right.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.510 align:middle line:90%
So here we come to--

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:42.620 align:middle line:84%
and let's vault forward another
2,000 years, and here we are.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And we're still trained
to go outside of ourselves

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.600 align:middle line:90%
for answers.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.160 align:middle line:90%
The person who--

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.555 align:middle line:90%
Ramtha has the answers.

00:26:49.555 --> 00:26:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Oh, please-- God
has the answers.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Please, please, God,
please tell me the answers.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.480 align:middle line:84%
So we're so vulnerable
because we're

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.900 align:middle line:84%
taught that authority is outside
ourselves, because we are

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.920 align:middle line:90%
corrupt and not to be trusted.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.840 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole message for
thousands of years, Regina.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: And we finally
bought the message.

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And here's the--
[CHUCKLES] oh, god.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.100 align:middle line:90%
Here's the thing.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.480 align:middle line:90%
We're the creators.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:24.080 align:middle line:84%
We are these. divine,
powerful, powerful beings.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting choked up.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:30.660 align:middle line:84%
We're the ones that have
to create the conflict.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.360 align:middle line:84%
We're the ones that have
to lower our own light.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.870 align:middle line:84%
We're the ones that have
to diminish ourselves

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:39.240 align:middle line:84%
because this influence
has no power.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.500 align:middle line:90%
It can't pick up a cup.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.020 align:middle line:84%
It has to convince us
to do the dirty work.

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:50.140 align:middle line:84%
It has to convince us that we
are less, that we're divided,

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:53.470 align:middle line:84%
that we're despicable,
that we're small.

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And when we buy that, as we're
powerful, creative beings,

00:27:57.770 --> 00:27:58.903 align:middle line:90%
we make it so.

00:27:58.903 --> 00:28:00.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We do make it so.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: We make it so.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:03.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And every time we
have those feelings and those

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:08.120 align:middle line:84%
thoughts about ourselves,
that is the nature of reality.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.510 align:middle line:84%
It is those feelings
and thoughts

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:12.890 align:middle line:84%
that are repeated
throughout the day,

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:15.380 align:middle line:84%
every day that become
the quality of our lives.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yeah.

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And we know.

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:20.866 align:middle line:90%
We've been-- I was a New Ager.

00:28:20.866 --> 00:28:22.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:25.670 align:middle line:84%
We've known, oh, your mind
is-- you create your reality.

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And we accept that
as a bumper sticker

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:32.370 align:middle line:84%
until we have to do our due
diligence, which is to-- you

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:33.170 align:middle line:90%
have a thought.

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:34.060 align:middle line:90%
You have a feeling.

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:35.560 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that person is--

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.590 align:middle line:90%
hold on a minute.

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:38.230 align:middle line:90%
Am I going to do that again?

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Start judging them to
somehow make yourself

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:43.540 align:middle line:84%
feel superior in some
teensy, little way

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:47.200 align:middle line:84%
in this competitive environment
that you're talking about.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And so the due diligence to
first quiet yourself like you

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:56.570 align:middle line:84%
did, start recognizing this body
already has everything in it,

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:57.370 align:middle line:90%
it's--

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:58.056 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: [CHUCKLES]

00:28:58.056 --> 00:28:58.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's permeating.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: This is life.

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: All consciousness
is permeating this space that

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:02.730 align:middle line:90%
you're sitting in.

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:03.240 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: It's all here--

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it's
accessible right here now.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And to dare to
say, wait a minute,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.670 align:middle line:84%
to yourself, why am I having
that ugly little thought

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:11.750 align:middle line:90%
about that person?

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:13.710 align:middle line:84%
What do I think I'm
gaining out of that?

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:15.725 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take
that level of maturity.

00:29:15.725 --> 00:29:16.525 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yes.

00:29:16.525 --> 00:29:18.455 align:middle line:84%
And when I look in the
mirror, what do I see?

00:29:18.455 --> 00:29:20.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh, god.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.710 align:middle line:90%
Is this a flab?

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:22.585 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god, wrinkles.

00:29:22.585 --> 00:29:23.385 align:middle line:90%
Ah!

00:29:23.385 --> 00:29:24.500 align:middle line:90%
Ooh.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.590 align:middle line:84%
The horrific self-judgment
is so painful.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Self-judgment, as
well as judgment of others,

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:34.220 align:middle line:84%
they are equally devastating
to the nature of what

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.495 align:middle line:90%
we're creating as our reality.

00:29:35.495 --> 00:29:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: We are
so powerful, Regina,

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.730 align:middle line:84%
and we don't see
what we're doing.

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And every time I go outside
of myself for answers,

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:45.980 align:middle line:84%
there's always going to be in
my next SlimFast recipe diet

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:48.540 align:middle line:84%
program, or it's going to
be in my next yoga program.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Or the answer is going to be
coming in the next book I read.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And so again, the program
is to always keep us

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.727 align:middle line:84%
outside of ourselves and
in a lack of self-trust.

00:29:59.727 --> 00:30:01.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and
now we're having--

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:04.130 align:middle line:84%
now we're starting to see
because everything is amplified

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:05.297 align:middle line:90%
right now because we're at--

00:30:05.297 --> 00:30:06.422 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Well, I'll say.

00:30:06.422 --> 00:30:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're at
the time of choosing,

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:09.858 align:middle line:84%
really at a critical
time of choosing.

00:30:09.858 --> 00:30:11.150 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Absolutely, Regina.

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so now a lot
of people are choosing to take

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:14.610 align:middle line:90%
their own lives.

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:15.410 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yeah.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:17.628 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're saying,
this is so painful here.

00:30:17.628 --> 00:30:19.420 align:middle line:84%
I can't do it anymore,
and I want to leave.

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:22.120 align:middle line:90%


00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.680 align:middle line:84%
I interview a lot of mediums,
and they say repeatedly,

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.810 align:middle line:84%
most people say, geez,
why did I do that?

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:32.310 align:middle line:84%
If I could have just had a
word with someone beforehand,

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:33.870 align:middle line:84%
something to give
me a little hope.

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:36.390 align:middle line:84%
There's so much to be
gained and learned here

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:38.260 align:middle line:90%
if we can hang in the game.

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.490 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about this.

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever feel like
that, like you just

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.860 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to be here anymore?

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:44.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:48.120 align:middle line:90%


00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.230 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Good question.

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:50.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes and no.

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:52.830 align:middle line:84%
I think the hard part
was looking at how

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:54.930 align:middle line:90%
screwed up everything is.

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:58.462 align:middle line:84%
And where's the way
back from the precipice?

00:30:58.462 --> 00:31:00.893 align:middle line:84%
And for the longest
time, it was like, well,

00:31:00.893 --> 00:31:02.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be a
spiritual light,

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:04.620 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
help fix the planet.

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And I finally gotten that
I can't fix what's broken,

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:12.000 align:middle line:84%
and what's broken--
it's kind of like--

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.410 align:middle line:84%
it's not kind of, it's totally
like, there's two paths.

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:20.950 align:middle line:84%
There's the path where
you embrace life and align

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:26.890 align:middle line:84%
with what is life giving and
life nurturing and sustaining--

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:31.330 align:middle line:84%
healthy things to eat,
pharmaceuticals not to take,

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:32.140 align:middle line:90%
certain--

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.840 align:middle line:84%
you have to follow that
inner compass of what

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:38.680 align:middle line:84%
is going to sustain
life and uplift

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.490 align:middle line:84%
and make you more whole
and grounded and loving

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:49.340 align:middle line:84%
and to not go the synthetic path
of avarice control, competition,

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:50.150 align:middle line:90%
conflict.

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:51.128 align:middle line:90%
It's the program.

00:31:51.128 --> 00:31:53.170 align:middle line:84%
You're either going to
buy the old program, which

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:56.320 align:middle line:84%
is coming from society, which
is coming from religion, which

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.160 align:middle line:90%
is coming from spirituality.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.560 align:middle line:84%
All those programs,
you're either

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:04.130 align:middle line:84%
going to go that and
buy the external,

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:06.440 align:middle line:90%
or you're going to go within.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to start
to learn to trust that.

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And boy, is that a
journey to learn,

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:14.300 align:middle line:90%
to start to trust yourself.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And it takes time.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:16.830 align:middle line:90%
We're too impatient.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:18.222 align:middle line:90%
We want all the answers now.

00:32:18.222 --> 00:32:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yeah.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But one thing I just
heard you say that makes total

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:21.730 align:middle line:90%
sense--

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:24.020 align:middle line:84%
it is a life of--
we've been trained

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.610 align:middle line:90%
to be consumers of everything.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:29.870 align:middle line:84%
We consume, take in, take in,
take in, instead of generators.

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And when we start
flipping that switch

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:36.330 align:middle line:84%
to thinking, what can I go
buy? what can I consume today?

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and start thinking, What
can I generate today?

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:40.930 align:middle line:90%
Is there something I can do?

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:43.140 align:middle line:90%
Is there something I can give?

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're just in an
interaction in the grocery

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:48.290 align:middle line:84%
store, can you give a little
bit of your self and your heart

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:51.042 align:middle line:84%
to that person
behind the register?

00:32:51.042 --> 00:32:54.690 align:middle line:84%
That begins a generative
life, those simple steps.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:55.490 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yeah.

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:56.562 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And so--

00:32:56.562 --> 00:32:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: That's a really--

00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:59.370 align:middle line:90%
I like that, generative life.

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:00.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, it was
really interesting.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, I was in
some kind of cult thing.

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:07.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.310 align:middle line:90%
It was eight days.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:09.745 align:middle line:90%
Someone talked me into it.

00:33:09.745 --> 00:33:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I was going through
a patch in life.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, you've
got to go do this thing.

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:15.740 align:middle line:90%
And I don't remember what--

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:16.540 align:middle line:90%
Wellspring?

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:17.340 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like
these boot camps,

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.390 align:middle line:84%
they put you in your
deprivation and 12 hours a day,

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:26.640 align:middle line:84%
and then they run you through
all these really intense

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:27.850 align:middle line:90%
exercises.

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:31.020 align:middle line:84%
But I remember one
that was spot on,

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:34.560 align:middle line:84%
and it's you-- there were
17 people in our group.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.325 align:middle line:90%
You, all lined up.

00:33:36.325 --> 00:33:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And then one of the
people in the group

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:40.830 align:middle line:84%
would go down and look in
your eyes really deeply

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:42.590 align:middle line:90%
and say, giver or taker?

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:43.797 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Oh.

00:33:43.797 --> 00:33:45.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean, it
gives you the chills--

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: It does.

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --to think about it.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we start
looking around--

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:48.970 align:middle line:90%
I got chills.

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:49.540 align:middle line:90%
I got chills--

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yeah, I do, too.

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Giver or taker?

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And what a vulnerable place that
put people in because people

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.840 align:middle line:84%
are just-- you're bound
to tell your truth.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yeah.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And there were
certain people there, taker,

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.210 align:middle line:90%
taker, taker.

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And they were just
devastated that they

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.280 align:middle line:90%
were perceived as a taker.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.530 align:middle line:84%
But their energy was
taken from the group.

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:12.330 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yeah.

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:15.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how do we start
identifying that in our own

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.669 align:middle line:84%
lives and in each other and in
ourselves and reversing that

00:34:18.669 --> 00:34:19.469 align:middle line:90%
then?

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:20.949 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to be a taker.

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:23.114 align:middle line:84%
We all want-- we're
just going to take.

00:34:23.114 --> 00:34:24.489 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take a little bit.

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:27.159 align:middle line:84%
As long as you're generating and
giving something back to life,

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:28.969 align:middle line:90%
that's OK.

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:31.280 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: Well, I mean,
what a great question.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.429 align:middle line:84%
And I think part
of that is, if I'm

00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:36.510 align:middle line:84%
in constant consumption
mode, again,

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:38.034 align:middle line:90%
reaching outside of myself,

00:34:38.034 --> 00:34:38.909 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Devouring.

00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:40.100 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Devouring, is--

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:46.290 align:middle line:84%
again, that's coming from
this inner belief, assumption

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:49.450 align:middle line:84%
that I am less than and
that I'm not enough.

00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:50.250 align:middle line:90%
It's just--

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:51.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You haven't
filled the void yet.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:53.423 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: You haven't
filled the void yet.

00:34:53.423 --> 00:34:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, my
God, it's epidemic

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:56.960 align:middle line:90%
in every region of our lives.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: And
to start to come--

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:01.440 align:middle line:84%
I think you've got
to recognize first

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.440 align:middle line:84%
where we're at, which is
at this depleted state

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:08.175 align:middle line:84%
that we have been influenced
to create in ourselves--

00:35:08.175 --> 00:35:10.515 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, it's worse
now with AI and algorithms.

00:35:10.515 --> 00:35:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Oh.

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now we're really
going down the rabbit hole.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:13.920 align:middle line:90%
We all know this.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got to be very,
very careful and discerning.

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:17.918 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: So to
start to build back up,

00:35:17.918 --> 00:35:20.340 align:middle line:84%
and discernment is
absolutely the key.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm out of
my body all the time

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.097 align:middle line:84%
trying to find
answers elsewhere--

00:35:24.097 --> 00:35:25.263 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, who's here?

00:35:25.263 --> 00:35:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: --then, who's here?

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:31.210 align:middle line:84%
The beauty about the body
is that it never lies.

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:34.140 align:middle line:90%
The body is pure life.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It is.

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: It contains
all information.

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And so that, everybody in the
world has had the intuitive hit.

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Don't turn right, like you
usually drive down there.

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.180 align:middle line:90%
Turn left for some reason.

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:47.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, well my body, my
quantum field of my body

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:50.323 align:middle line:84%
is reading the quantum field
of the energy of down the road,

00:35:50.323 --> 00:35:51.740 align:middle line:84%
there's a board
with a nail in it.

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:53.282 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
run over it, and I'm

00:35:53.282 --> 00:35:54.800 align:middle line:90%
going to get a flat tire.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.330 align:middle line:84%
My knowingness doesn't
know there's a nail there,

00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:58.580 align:middle line:90%
but something says, turn left.

00:35:58.580 --> 00:35:59.900 align:middle line:90%
And I turn left.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:02.600 align:middle line:84%
But we got to be quiet
enough to hear that,

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and we have to be trusting
enough to trust it.

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:07.290 align:middle line:90%
And that is the process.

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:11.230 align:middle line:84%
That's the journey
I'm on since COVID

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and since I opened the door to
look at the dark and the light

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:18.282 align:middle line:84%
and the gray and all the
areas to see what's going on.

00:36:18.282 --> 00:36:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's a beautiful
and worthy journey.

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And I know you, so I
know where it's taken you

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:25.760 align:middle line:84%
to this beautiful opening
and acceptance of self,

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.390 align:middle line:84%
which is where everyone needs
to ultimately find themselves.

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:30.950 align:middle line:90%
And what you said is true.

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:33.700 align:middle line:90%
HeartMath, the whole HeartMath--

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:37.750 align:middle line:84%
I had the privilege one time of
being in a session where there

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:40.600 align:middle line:90%
was a brain state technology.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Someone had electrodes
on their brain,

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and then they had
HeartMath device.

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And electrodes on
the heart region,

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:49.930 align:middle line:84%
and then they were
exposed to stimuli

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:52.000 align:middle line:90%
to see what responds first.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.700 align:middle line:84%
The heart responds
and the stomach

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.990 align:middle line:90%
responds before the brain.

00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yeah.

00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So imagine--

00:36:58.780 --> 00:36:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: The
brain is clueless.

00:36:59.550 --> 00:36:59.870 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:03.310 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what that
feels like when you're-- say you

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:05.560 align:middle line:84%
want to know something, and
you're going to get quiet.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.982 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about using
the body in this way,

00:37:07.982 --> 00:37:09.815 align:middle line:84%
because that's really
what you're doing now.

00:37:09.815 --> 00:37:10.230 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:11.772 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: It is
what I'm doing now.

00:37:11.772 --> 00:37:13.542 align:middle line:90%
It's the exact flip opposite.

00:37:13.542 --> 00:37:14.375 align:middle line:90%
Don't you know the--

00:37:14.375 --> 00:37:17.300 align:middle line:84%
I always said, in the end times,
this is the black will be white,

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.300 align:middle line:90%
and white will be black.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:19.560 align:middle line:90%
The truth will be a lie.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.570 align:middle line:90%
Everything is inverted.

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's where we are.

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: Everything
is inverted.

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: I was taught for 35,
40 years to go out of my body

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:27.890 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
the answers lay.

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:31.835 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm getting in my body
[CHUCKLES] and using the life.

00:37:31.835 --> 00:37:35.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is the
nexus of everything.

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And so all the answers
are right here.

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:42.840 align:middle line:84%
So yes, it is a process of
learning to just be quiet.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.190 align:middle line:90%
I go sit out in the yard.

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:45.720 align:middle line:90%
I just go sit under a tree.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.190 align:middle line:84%
I literally take-- Regina, I
take assiduously half an hour

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:50.270 align:middle line:90%
a day.

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:51.750 align:middle line:90%
I take my shoes off.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:54.200 align:middle line:84%
I shut my phone off, and
I leave it in the house.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And I go sit under a tree
and just sit with nature.

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And I commune with
the life force itself.

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:07.220 align:middle line:90%
My nature is nature.

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:09.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And in the end,
every great sage and prophet,

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:11.522 align:middle line:90%
that all comes back to that.

00:38:11.522 --> 00:38:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: It all comes
back to the utter simplicity

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:16.580 align:middle line:84%
of what's already
in us and around us.

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And if you
want to know something,

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:21.310 align:middle line:84%
just learn how to be quiet,
and learn how to ask.

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:22.110 align:middle line:90%
It'll come.

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:22.830 align:middle line:90%
It'll be right there.

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:23.630 align:middle line:90%
You'll know.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't get
it by way of pictures,

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:27.480 align:middle line:84%
voices, and so forth,
does it matter,

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.210 align:middle line:84%
because your body
will say, that is--

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: That
doesn't feel right.

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:31.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I've
got a stomach ache.

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:32.180 align:middle line:90%
We're not going--

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: That
doesn't feel right.

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:37.230 align:middle line:84%
I recently had a job,
a career, real career,

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:39.060 align:middle line:84%
what looked like a
huge opportunity.

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:42.080 align:middle line:84%
It was like everything
that my old spiritual ego

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:45.380 align:middle line:90%
wanted, wrapped up in a bow.

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:48.290 align:middle line:90%
And I got so sick.

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:50.000 align:middle line:90%
And my body was just like--

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I started getting
migraine precursors.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:57.270 align:middle line:84%
It was just like, oh, my
body was just like, no,

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:58.110 align:middle line:90%
do not go there.

00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh OK, that's
the opportunity of a lifetime,

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:01.410 align:middle line:90%
not.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:02.660 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't do it.

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:04.770 align:middle line:84%
It was like, well,
how simple is that?

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:05.570 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:06.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:09.432 align:middle line:90%
And it is a process.

00:39:09.432 --> 00:39:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Like everybody want
answers instantaneously.

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:13.380 align:middle line:90%
I want certainty.

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:15.350 align:middle line:84%
Somebody asked me
the other day, what

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:18.400 align:middle line:90%
is your definition of heaven?

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.400 align:middle line:84%
I thought about it for a
second, and I was like,

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You didn't.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:21.760 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Certainty.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, you did.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.060 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Certainty.

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:27.680 align:middle line:84%
That's my idea of
heaven, is to know,

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.810 align:middle line:84%
not from some cluttered
mental state that says,

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:33.990 align:middle line:84%
I've got the right factoids,
and so, yes, I know this,

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:40.960 align:middle line:84%
but that I have the ease and the
grace and the peace in my being,

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:46.936 align:middle line:84%
in my body to go, ah, I know
that is not something for me.

00:39:46.936 --> 00:39:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Ah, I know I want to go do that.

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, an
organic certainty,

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.257 align:middle line:90%
not a mental certainty.

00:39:53.257 --> 00:39:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Exactly.

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:55.173 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Big difference.

00:39:55.173 --> 00:39:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Big, huge, huge.

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:57.555 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:57.555 --> 00:39:59.805 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: That whole program
is to take us away from

00:39:59.805 --> 00:40:01.720 align:middle line:84%
ourselves, take us
away from nature.

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:05.740 align:middle line:84%
If you look-- if you just
look at the overview of life,

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.560 align:middle line:84%
again, whether it's social,
religious, or spiritual,

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.560 align:middle line:84%
so much of it is about
taking us out of nature,

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.540 align:middle line:90%
taking us out of our bodies.

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:15.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, wow.

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:18.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's been a shocker to
realize that, well, the answer

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:19.460 align:middle line:90%
was here all the time.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it
was here all the time.

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:22.310 align:middle line:84%
I just have to sit with
my feet in the dirt.

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:23.110 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Really.

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we're
talking about mind.

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:28.220 align:middle line:84%
We're speaking about mind
almost like it's a bad thing.

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:30.200 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is
it's not a bad thing.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.367 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: No, it's a tool.

00:40:31.367 --> 00:40:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It is a subtle aspect
of ourselves that is here for us

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.940 align:middle line:84%
to utilize, but
it's a powerful one.

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And through repetition,
we, the real we,

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.420 align:middle line:84%
get to choose the
kind of thoughts

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:45.100 align:middle line:84%
we want to have that will
end up being and reflecting

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.720 align:middle line:84%
as the quality of
the life around us

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.440 align:middle line:90%
and the decisions that we make.

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.360 align:middle line:90%
So we're not saying mind is bad.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:53.980 align:middle line:84%
This is an interesting,
all these subtle bodies

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:55.730 align:middle line:90%
around the real us.

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And what I like
to do sometimes--

00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:59.680 align:middle line:84%
I used to lead these
meditations for years.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things I would do is

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:03.760 align:middle line:84%
when people were like,
your mind is telling you

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.400 align:middle line:84%
one thing, your
emotions are over here,

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.370 align:middle line:84%
is have them almost
like a magnetic rod.

00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Allow all the subtle bodies
to just magnetically be

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:16.690 align:middle line:84%
drawn in to the physical
body with the magnetic rod

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:19.990 align:middle line:84%
down the middle so
they're all cooperating.

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And if one of them
starts being disruptive,

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:28.770 align:middle line:84%
uh-uh, shh, no, bring it back in
with the mind or the emotions.

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:32.970 align:middle line:84%
If, really, more carnal stuff
is firing, no, just stop.

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:33.970 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: It's all OK.

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:35.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Just
bring it right here,

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:38.700 align:middle line:84%
and let's start cooperating
and see what really needs to be

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:39.520 align:middle line:90%
addressed.

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: And I don't
have to shut anything up.

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:41.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, you don't.

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:42.540 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Here's the--

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:43.340 align:middle line:90%
boy.

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:51.240 align:middle line:84%
The less process, the
less formula, the better.

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, so my mind is
going 1,000 miles an hour.

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:58.270 align:middle line:84%
I am still in nature,
aligning with the Earth.

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:00.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting on-- my
butt's on the ground,

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.490 align:middle line:90%
so I'm still aligned.

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:05.550 align:middle line:84%
This is my-- this is
my conscious place

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:06.610 align:middle line:90%
right here, right now.

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:08.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to
convince some higher

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:11.462 align:middle line:84%
self that I need to do
something to be aligned with--

00:42:11.462 --> 00:42:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's already here.

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: It's already here.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And so if my mind is
going 1,000 miles an hour,

00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:20.170 align:middle line:84%
if my stomach is rumbling, if
my emotions are a little over

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.370 align:middle line:90%
a situation, it's all OK.

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's OK.

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: Those are
clouds passing by.

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:26.330 align:middle line:90%
Big deal.

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Bring it on in.

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:27.920 align:middle line:90%
Embrace it all.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.340 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yeah.

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And one of the things
you had in your book that I

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:32.530 align:middle line:84%
wrote down here-- and
I have to share it just

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:33.986 align:middle line:90%
because it's so unconscionable.

00:42:33.986 --> 00:42:35.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:39.012 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- this was a "New
Yorker" magazine cartoon.

00:42:39.012 --> 00:42:39.845 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Oh, God.

00:42:39.845 --> 00:42:41.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I loved it because
this is actually very truthful.

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.710 align:middle line:84%
This is what humanity
is up against,

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:50.870 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to the message, the
beautiful message you're giving.

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:54.550 align:middle line:84%
So the CEO is addressing the
shareholders in a meeting.

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:57.850 align:middle line:84%
It said, "So while the end of
the world scenario will be rife

00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:01.900 align:middle line:84%
with unimaginable horrors, we
believe the pre-end period to be

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:04.980 align:middle line:84%
filled with unprecedented
opportunities for profit."

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:07.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:08.500 align:middle line:90%


00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:09.660 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:10.460 align:middle line:90%
That's here.

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Even the New Age movement,
religions, everything

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:15.220 align:middle line:90%
has been bent against us now.

00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Even the whole
notion of conspiracy,

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:22.720 align:middle line:84%
conspiracy communities have
been bent against our--

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:25.450 align:middle line:84%
settling into this
beautiful place of knowing.

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:27.320 align:middle line:84%
They're now becoming
distractions.

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.600 align:middle line:90%
So I feel, you're right on.

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.800 align:middle line:90%
You're right on, Cate.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.920 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't agree with
you more, that it's

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:37.690 align:middle line:84%
time to say, just shut up, and
go inside and feel what's true.

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:38.555 align:middle line:90%
Any final thoughts?

00:43:38.555 --> 00:43:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Because believe it or
not, we're out of time.

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:41.120 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Holy moly.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, it flew.

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yeah.

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I wrote an article
in my Substack column

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.910 align:middle line:84%
recently about
leaving storyland.

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:50.660 align:middle line:84%
It's this endless-- the
mind is a beautiful place.

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:52.250 align:middle line:90%
Again, I'm not knocking it.

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:54.125 align:middle line:90%
And there's so much fascination.

00:43:54.125 --> 00:43:54.925 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wonder.

00:43:54.925 --> 00:43:58.120 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: But look at the--
what an amazing creation

00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:59.630 align:middle line:90%
we're involved in.

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:01.760 align:middle line:10%
And so just to
keep the open mind,

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.060 align:middle line:10%
to keep the questioning
mind, to keep the heart

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:08.560 align:middle line:10%
open, to know that
this place is--

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.860 align:middle line:10%
there's nothing I have
to be safe against when

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:16.240 align:middle line:10%
I am fully present and
in my love and in my body

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.690 align:middle line:10%
and aligned with life.

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:19.710 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
that can penetrate.

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:22.220 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing that
can knock me off course.

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:26.548 align:middle line:84%
And that's that steadfast
place that's so simple.

00:44:26.548 --> 00:44:28.590 align:middle line:84%
Even though the mind's
going 1,000 miles an hour,

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:30.440 align:middle line:84%
the emotions, and the
mortgage is due, and eh-eh,

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.320 align:middle line:90%
all that's going on.

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.520 align:middle line:84%
But there's this
magnetic wholeness

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:39.660 align:middle line:84%
that is just a presence that
is accountable and trustworthy.

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:40.990 align:middle line:90%
And it's brilliant.

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You're
embodying your true you.

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:44.480 align:middle line:90%

00:44:50.412 --> 00:44:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And ourselves are
filled with light.

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:53.480 align:middle line:90%
>> MONTANA: Yes.

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Cate this has been my
most fun conversation with you

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:56.880 align:middle line:90%

00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:58.610 align:middle line:90%

>> REGINA: It does.

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:01.520 align:middle line:84%

goes out there and is punching
all the demons to find

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:04.980 align:middle line:90%
your way back to you.

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.397 align:middle line:84%
>> MONTANA: Takes
one to know one.

00:45:06.397 --> 00:45:07.560 align:middle line:90%
