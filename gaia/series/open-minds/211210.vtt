when someone says, oh, no,
we're only using 5 or 10%

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.100 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.430 align:middle line:90%
What's actually going on?

>> TARA SWART: We don't talk
about hardwiring anymore.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.830 align:middle line:84%
We talk about
softwiring, which means

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.530 align:middle line:84%
that even something that's
been there for a very long time

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.680 align:middle line:84%
can be, not undone,
but overwritten.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.950 align:middle line:84%
I still see so many people,
including high-powered people,

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.890 align:middle line:84%
that are not doing these
basic things, which is rest,

fuel, hydrate,
oxygenate, and simplify.

Your brain is a tiny
percentage of your whole body.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very
energy-hungry organ.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.010 align:middle line:84%
It's using up 20% of what you
eat today when you're asleep.

brain potential,

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.490 align:middle line:84%

is going to tell you about the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.730 align:middle line:10%
your favorite practices, such as
vision boards and visualization

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.200 align:middle line:10%

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.420 align:middle line:84%
This means, next time a
friend or family member

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.090 align:middle line:84%
pokes fun at you for
your positive practices,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.550 align:middle line:84%
you can read them
in on the science.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:90%
It's just lovely to see you.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.170 align:middle line:90%
And I have your book.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.510 align:middle line:10%
It has at least 100
dog-eared pages,

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.220 align:middle line:10%
which is like every other page.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.170 align:middle line:10%
You really are now
bridging the gap

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.200 align:middle line:10%
between the world of
neuroscience and the practices

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.230 align:middle line:10%
that we've all participated
in over the last 30, 40

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.170 align:middle line:10%
years the evolution of
human consciousness.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I just want
to applaud you

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.920 align:middle line:90%
for doing the hard work for us.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:84%
I think yours is really now
the primer on how to use

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.820 align:middle line:90%
the brain to a better effect.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.505 align:middle line:90%
So first, welcome.

00:01:50.505 --> 00:01:53.130 align:middle line:10%
>> SWART: Thank you so much for
having me and for acknowledging

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.510 align:middle line:10%
that because, at one
point in my career,

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:10%
it did feel like
a bit of a risk.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.360 align:middle line:84%
As a professor at
MIT, I wanted to start

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.180 align:middle line:84%
sharing my personal
beliefs about spirituality.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.480 align:middle line:10%
And, after a crisis
in my own life,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.210 align:middle line:10%
I'd managed to merge
those really successfully,

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.120 align:middle line:10%
the science and
the spirituality.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And, actually,
writing "The Source"

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and having it come
out into the world

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.180 align:middle line:84%
was probably that
last step that really

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.090 align:middle line:84%
made me feel like, yes,
these two things can coexist.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And not only can they,
but it's so, so important

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.120 align:middle line:84%
for people to understand
and leverage that.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's not
just, can they coexist?

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.970 align:middle line:90%
They do coexist.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:30.770 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: I know.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We just had
everything so partitioned

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.200 align:middle line:84%
in our understanding
of how mind works.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And you've allowed all
of it to come together,

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.313 align:middle line:84%
but to explain it in a
scientific way why it works.

00:02:43.313 --> 00:02:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So let's start
with your childhood

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.790 align:middle line:84%
because you were raised
in England, in London.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.550 align:middle line:84%
But you came from East
Indian parents and heritage.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And they still had some
of their practices,

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.410 align:middle line:84%
which you weren't initially
proud of, especially

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.210 align:middle line:90%
as a teenager.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.880 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that
and how that influenced you.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: Yeah, so what I feel
is that, when people emigrate,

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.670 align:middle line:84%
they actually hold on to their
traditions even more strongly

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.920 align:middle line:84%
than people that remain
in the original country.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.910 align:middle line:84%
So things like my
cousins eat meat,

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.000 align:middle line:84%
but I was brought up
completely vegetarian.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.830 align:middle line:90%
And, yeah, the classic things.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.570 align:middle line:84%
We had like the
chanting and the incense

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.600 align:middle line:84%
sticks and the meditation and
the yoga and the breathwork.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.260 align:middle line:90%
I was brought up with that.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And it became popular in
Western culture decades later.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted
to fit in at school.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.575 align:middle line:84%
I didn't-- nobody
else's parents.

00:03:32.575 --> 00:03:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You didn't want to
smell like incense when you

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:35.980 align:middle line:90%
came in the classroom.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: Or curry.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.613 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Or curry.

00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:38.490 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: So, yeah, I guess
there was a period of time that

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.840 align:middle line:90%
I rejected those things.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I had to
come full circle.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.210 align:middle line:84%
But what I really did
was I separated them.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.250 align:middle line:84%
So I had one life
at home and one life

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.380 align:middle line:90%
at school and with my friends.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And it took a certain
level of maturity.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.130 align:middle line:84%
But then it also actually
took a personal crisis for me

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.940 align:middle line:84%
to really think about, well,
I need elements of both.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of
started the journey

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.488 align:middle line:90%
of the career change and then--

00:04:08.488 --> 00:04:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The
integration of these--

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.113 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: The integration.

00:04:11.113 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you became a
teenage little fashionista

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and things like this,
what girls do in London,

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.329 align:middle line:90%
great place to be a fashionista.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.160 align:middle line:84%
But you decided to get a
degree in neuroscience.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And, also, as I
recall, psychology, you

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.113 align:middle line:84%
were working with
psychology and neuroscience.

00:04:31.113 --> 00:04:32.530 align:middle line:84%
How did that go
in your education?

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.072 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: The way that it works
in the UK is a bit different.

00:04:35.072 --> 00:04:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And, actually, when
I went to university,

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.950 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't-- neuroscience
itself wasn't a degree.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.803 align:middle line:84%
So we can go straight from
high school to medical school.

00:04:44.803 --> 00:04:45.970 align:middle line:90%
So I went to medical school.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, without the
interim four years we have

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.185 align:middle line:90%
in America.

00:04:49.185 --> 00:04:49.985 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:04:49.985 --> 00:04:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: So we have the
theoretical three years.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's called preclinical.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And then you-- well,
it's actually two.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.890 align:middle line:84%
But you can do special
topics in the third year.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And I chose the neuro
of every topic--

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.450 align:middle line:84%
neuroanatomy, neuropharmacology,
neurophysiology.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting, OK.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.548 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: I was just so
fascinated by the brain

00:05:07.548 --> 00:05:10.320 align:middle line:84%
and the mind, which was still
seen as quite separate at that

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.120 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle line:90%
So I did my PhD in neuroscience.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.490 align:middle line:84%
I took three years
out to do that.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Then I came back
to medical school

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.150 align:middle line:90%
and did clinical practice.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.025 align:middle line:84%
I thought I wanted to
become a neurologist,

00:05:21.025 --> 00:05:22.900 align:middle line:84%
but I decided to become
a psychiatrist, which

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.170 align:middle line:84%
is an MD, as opposed
to a psychologist.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And I worked as a
psychiatrist for seven years.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.353 align:middle line:84%
And then I decided to change
career at around the same time

00:05:32.353 --> 00:05:33.520 align:middle line:90%
that I was getting divorced.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how old would
you have been at that time

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.580 align:middle line:84%
because the difference in the
way the years are calculated

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.000 align:middle line:90%
in your educational system.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.125 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: So I went to
university at the age of 18.

00:05:43.125 --> 00:05:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was at university
for nine years.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And I came out with
an MD and a PhD.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you're 27 years
old when you entered the work

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:middle line:90%
world as a psychiatrist.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: Yes.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then you were
working with the national

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.810 align:middle line:90%
health care system.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.430 align:middle line:90%
So there are certain guidelines.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And so you were allowed
to throw lots of pills

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.240 align:middle line:90%
at people if need be.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.152 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: Oh, yes.

00:06:02.152 --> 00:06:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you could toss
them their prescriptions

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.170 align:middle line:90%
and their pills.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.937 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't getting
better in the way

00:06:06.937 --> 00:06:09.020 align:middle line:84%
that you would like to
have seen for your clients.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.810 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
your experience

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.470 align:middle line:84%
as a young and, at this time,
compassionate and idealistic

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.895 align:middle line:90%
young psychiatrist.

00:06:16.895 --> 00:06:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: Thank you for
asking that question.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So all I did was
diagnose and prescribe.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And, even though I was into
healthy eating and exercise,

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.800 align:middle line:84%
it could be mentioned,
but it certainly

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.400 align:middle line:84%
wasn't part of the holistic way
that our patients were treated.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And I cared a great
deal about my patients.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.600 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't stay
in that system.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.260 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel like I would
be giving the best of myself

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.970 align:middle line:84%
to the world if I
stayed in that system.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.218 align:middle line:84%
And so I got to the
point where-- in the NHS,

00:06:49.218 --> 00:06:50.760 align:middle line:84%
you're really dealing
with the lowest

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.360 align:middle line:90%
socioeconomic group of people.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Usually, their families
have deserted them.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.180 align:middle line:90%
They don't have partners.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.847 align:middle line:84%
Their children are
taken away from them.

00:06:58.847 --> 00:07:00.480 align:middle line:90%
They can't hold down a job.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK,
what could I really do

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:07.950 align:middle line:84%
to make life better for these
people in a very different way?

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And the first part
of that step was

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.560 align:middle line:84%
to go and work with businesses,
with really influential people

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.350 align:middle line:84%
that have corporate social
responsibility and teams

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and families and kind of work
through that cascade effect.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And then, as you know,
the latest iteration

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.990 align:middle line:84%
has been much more about
being on social media,

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.730 align:middle line:84%
having my podcast,
writing my book,

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.540 align:middle line:84%
and trying to spread that
information as excessively--

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Far and wide.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: --as possible.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So you went along.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And there came a
point in your life.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:38.130 align:middle line:84%
You were feeling
this dissatisfaction.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:39.120 align:middle line:90%
Let me just ask you.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.790 align:middle line:84%
When you're sitting with
someone whose life is so broken,

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:45.990 align:middle line:84%
whose health is in such poor
shape mentally and physically,

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.240 align:middle line:84%
did you feel like
if you could just

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:84%
take time out and
away from everything

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.080 align:middle line:84%
and be with this
person, you could really

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.898 align:middle line:90%
do something for them?

00:07:53.898 --> 00:07:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: You're giving me
goosebumps because it's been

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.840 align:middle line:84%
so long since I was
in that position.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.750 align:middle line:84%
But I remember always saying
if I could bottle a loving

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.840 align:middle line:90%
partner, I'd be out of a job.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.910 align:middle line:84%
So the few patients
that did have

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:09.540 align:middle line:84%
somebody that really stuck by
them through the tough times

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.880 align:middle line:84%
and in the good times and
helped them to make sure

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.470 align:middle line:84%
that they stayed
on their medication

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.570 align:middle line:84%
or practiced the
healthy life habits,

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.760 align:middle line:84%
there was a huge difference
between those people

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.370 align:middle line:84%
and the people that had
nobody that cared about them

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore, no real purpose
other than just surviving.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, absolutely, there's
just always some patients

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.159 align:middle line:90%
that you fall in love with.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:34.409 align:middle line:84%
And you have a special
relationship with their family.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And you think if I
could take you home,

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.179 align:middle line:84%
you'd never have to go
to the hospital again.

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:40.539 align:middle line:90%
There is that element of that.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:41.610 align:middle line:84%
But you can't do
that for everyone.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:42.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, you can't.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And I ask because this is
a growing phenomena right

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.870 align:middle line:90%
now certainly in America.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how it's
handled in England.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.470 align:middle line:90%
But I live in California.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're known-- we make
headlines in the news

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.480 align:middle line:84%
for our homeless situation,
which is usually--

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.360 align:middle line:84%
has a great deal to do with
mental illness and people who

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.850 align:middle line:90%
aren't able to hang on anymore.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And no one knows-- they don't
know-- there's no system really

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.420 align:middle line:90%
in place for that.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And you're right--
there isn't a partner.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:84%
These people don't
have a loving partner.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.060 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: It's totally heart--
it's totally heartbreaking.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.018 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The partner,
if they have a partner,

00:09:14.018 --> 00:09:16.300 align:middle line:84%
it's usually their dog,
which is better than--

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: Nothing.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.290 align:middle line:84%
OK, so, in your own life,
you had some breakdowns

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.090 align:middle line:90%
of your own.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:24.310 align:middle line:84%
So you're going along, and
you're a little hotshot

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:25.110 align:middle line:90%
doing your thing.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.580 align:middle line:90%
You're a little brokenhearted.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.540 align:middle line:90%
You can't do more.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.730 align:middle line:90%
And you're married.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.060 align:middle line:90%
OK, now what happens?

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: So I was married
to somebody who was also

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:34.230 align:middle line:90%
a psychiatrist.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.090 align:middle line:90%
So we worked together.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And we'd met quite young, and we
were from different countries.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:40.590 align:middle line:90%
He's South African.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.382 align:middle line:84%
We're actually very,
very good friends now.

00:09:42.382 --> 00:09:46.380 align:middle line:84%
But I think, in those
formative years, from 25 to 35,

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.910 align:middle line:84%
we just grew into
very different people.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And I had already started
thinking about changing career.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was so
interesting looking back

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:57.150 align:middle line:84%
that people thought
it was really strange

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.950 align:middle line:84%
that I would give up
being a medical doctor

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.550 align:middle line:90%
to become a coach.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I was challenged on
that on an almost daily basis.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.243 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
I had to come up

00:10:05.243 --> 00:10:06.660 align:middle line:84%
with a really good
answer to that.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it was going to start
affecting my own idea of what

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.210 align:middle line:90%
I should be doing and who I am.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And, like we said, in the
UK, you go to medical school

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:90%
when you're 18.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Your entire adult life is
associated with that identity,

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.487 align:middle line:90%
that you're a doctor.

00:10:22.487 --> 00:10:23.820 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know anything else.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't think I
could do anything else.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.870 align:middle line:84%
So I had to start
saying to people,

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.610 align:middle line:84%
no, the reason I
think it's better

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.650 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to do what
I'm going to go and do

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.480 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit
like I said to you--

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.990 align:middle line:90%
I can have a bigger impact.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think that kind of
widened the gap between us

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle line:84%
because it felt like
what I was saying was,

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.530 align:middle line:84%
your job isn't good
enough for me anymore.

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And I can go and do
something better.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.460 align:middle line:84%
So he was still very
supportive in terms

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.710 align:middle line:84%
of we'd agreed that if
I gave up my job that I

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:57.060 align:middle line:84%
would need a bit of help
to get started again.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.250 align:middle line:84%
But I found myself
in my mid-30s,

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.710 align:middle line:84%
having been married,
suddenly single,

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.510 align:middle line:84%
having been a
doctor-- and that was

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.670 align:middle line:84%
a very strong part
of my identity--

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.640 align:middle line:84%
not really knowing
what I was anymore.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.690 align:middle line:84%
We'd also lived abroad
a couple of times.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.570 align:middle line:84%
So we'd worked in
Australia and in Bermuda.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So I came back home to London
to start my new career.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.720 align:middle line:84%
But I had to find a
place to live on my own

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.350 align:middle line:84%
again and reintegrate
with my school friends.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.120 align:middle line:84%
So it was a real
period of transition.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And, at that time, I was
drawn to Jungian psychology

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.240 align:middle line:90%
and Buddhist philosophy.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Those were just the
two things that I

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:36.120 align:middle line:84%
became super interested in and
went down a rabbit hole with.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And they seemed to make
sense together to me

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.630 align:middle line:84%
and those were the
essences and concepts

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.210 align:middle line:84%
that helped me to come out
of that very dark place

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.455 align:middle line:90%
that I was in for a while.

00:11:47.455 --> 00:11:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think that must have
stuck with me when I came back

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.247 align:middle line:84%
to write "The
Source" because it's

00:11:51.247 --> 00:11:54.640 align:middle line:84%
kind of psychological but
also Eastern spirituality.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's definitely been
a theme because I think--

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:57.810 align:middle line:90%
I was 35 then.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:01.350 align:middle line:84%
So it was seven, eight years
later that I wrote the book.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right, so tell us.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.370 align:middle line:84%
What is-- before we go into
the rest of the story--

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.500 align:middle line:90%
what is "the source?"

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: So the source,
obviously, has very,

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:14.460 align:middle line:84%
very strong spiritual
connotations in terms of being

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.352 align:middle line:90%
whatever--

00:12:15.352 --> 00:12:17.310 align:middle line:84%
however you call it, God,
the universe, spirit.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is a very
open-minded audience.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:21.550 align:middle line:90%
Any term you wish.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.450 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: And so any term
that each of us wishes.

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's basically
the place that all

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.640 align:middle line:84%
of that spiritual energy comes
from that we can tap into,

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.570 align:middle line:84%
that means that
we're all connected.

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.440 align:middle line:84%
But I took that word, with
all of those connotations,

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.440 align:middle line:84%
and said, basically,
for you, it's

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.990 align:middle line:84%
your brainpower
and the potential

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.130 align:middle line:84%
that you hold that
you haven't used yet.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:48.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's both of those things,
the spiritual and the fact

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:84%
that, in your own
brain, unless you're

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:84%
a neuroscientist and
an MD, you probably

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.950 align:middle line:84%
don't know how
incredible your brain is.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:58.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Absolutely,
so we always hear, well,

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.240 align:middle line:84%
we're only using, oh,
about 10% of the brain.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Now that's-- we're
talking brain versus mind,

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:90%
a whole different subject.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.440 align:middle line:84%
So, as a neuroscientist,
when someone says,

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.940 align:middle line:84%
oh no, we're only using,
oh, 5 or 10% of the brain.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.070 align:middle line:90%
What's actually going on?

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:16.260 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: OK, so it doesn't
quite work like that.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.630 align:middle line:90%
So you've got your brain.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:22.470 align:middle line:84%
The emotional part is about
the size of your clenched fist.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And then the more
logical systems

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:27.120 align:middle line:84%
are around that in about
the same kind of width.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's all systems
and subsystems

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:31.270 align:middle line:84%
that have cascade
effects with each other.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not like this
part of your brain

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.340 align:middle line:84%
is for reading and writing
and that part of your brain

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.860 align:middle line:90%
is for vision.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.370 align:middle line:84%
So it may be that, when you're
sitting here interviewing,

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:43.590 align:middle line:84%
as a very experienced
person, you're

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:47.010 align:middle line:84%
accessing a 10% of your brain
that's just honed into this

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.080 align:middle line:90%
being an expert at this task.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.670 align:middle line:84%
But you can access
all of your brain,

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.510 align:middle line:84%
but you don't need
to all the time.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:58.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's really about
maybe accessing parts

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.360 align:middle line:84%
that you don't use all
the time to just increase

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.230 align:middle line:84%
your field of what you
can do, maybe using

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.210 align:middle line:84%
different parts of the
brain at the same time

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.580 align:middle line:84%
together more often
than we have to.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And just really accessing
all of the potential

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.892 align:middle line:84%
that you have because the
brain is very energy efficient.

00:14:15.892 --> 00:14:17.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's what
I was just going to ask.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:20.580 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: So it won't do that
unless you override it and say,

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.577 align:middle line:84%
but I want to bring
in my creativity.

00:14:22.577 --> 00:14:23.910 align:middle line:90%
I want to bring in my curiosity.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's always
going to conserve energy.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.490 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: Exactly.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.560 align:middle line:84%
So the things you're
really good at,

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.170 align:middle line:84%
those are the easiest
things for your brain to do.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now let's
talk about another myth.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:37.075 align:middle line:84%
And that is, well, it's a shame
what's happening because--

00:14:37.075 --> 00:14:38.700 align:middle line:84%
especially when you
see little children

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.570 align:middle line:84%
that aren't having the best
programming in their youth--

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:43.860 align:middle line:90%
say it's a shame.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.450 align:middle line:90%
It's all done by seven.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:46.830 align:middle line:90%
We are who we are.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:49.020 align:middle line:84%
That's when all the
development happens.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Myth, so let's go ahead
and bust that myth.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: I love
busting neuromyths.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.730 align:middle line:90%
So this is good.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.170 align:middle line:90%
So there's a couple of things.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:59.820 align:middle line:84%
We used to think
that, by the time

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.850 align:middle line:84%
you physically stop
growing, so roughly 18,

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:05.070 align:middle line:84%
that that's kind of
when your brain is set.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.940 align:middle line:84%
But a subset of that is that
the things that you experience

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.280 align:middle line:84%
by the age of seven
have the biggest

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.240 align:middle line:84%
impact on your personality
and how you're triggered

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.990 align:middle line:84%
and how you respond
to things for the rest

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.200 align:middle line:90%
of your emotional life.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:22.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's not untrue that
the longer a pathway

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:23.860 align:middle line:90%
has been in your brain--

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.080 align:middle line:84%
so neurons that fire
together wire together.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.550 align:middle line:84%
The more you
experience something,

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:28.810 align:middle line:90%
that becomes more entrenched--

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:31.030 align:middle line:84%
an entrenched pathway
in your brain.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not untrue that the
longer it's been there,

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:36.850 align:middle line:84%
the more subconsciously
that will play out.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.590 align:middle line:84%
But we don't talk about
hardwiring anymore.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:41.740 align:middle line:84%
We talk about
softwiring, which means

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:44.680 align:middle line:84%
that even something that's
been there for a very long time

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:49.070 align:middle line:84%
can be, not undone,
but overwritten.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:51.220 align:middle line:84%
So I'm being very, very
precise with my words

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:55.985 align:middle line:84%
here because I could just
say, no, that's not true--

00:15:55.985 --> 00:15:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I like
the word overwritten,

00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:59.140 align:middle line:90%
to overwrite a program.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.690 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: Because you can't
actually undo a pathway

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:02.660 align:middle line:90%
in your brain.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:06.760 align:middle line:84%
But if you replace it with
a new desired thought that--

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's stronger.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:10.210 align:middle line:90%
Do they compete?

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:11.210 align:middle line:90%
How does that work then?

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:11.910 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: They compete.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.620 align:middle line:84%
So the one that's been
there for longer--

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.230 align:middle line:84%
this is why that
myth comes about.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.850 align:middle line:84%
The one that's
been there already

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.230 align:middle line:90%
is the energy-efficient pathway.

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.890 align:middle line:84%
So there's two things
that can overwrite that--

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:25.460 align:middle line:84%
repetition and
emotional intensity.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.020 align:middle line:84%
So repetition we can
control quite easily.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:32.600 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you have a
belief that you were just

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.120 align:middle line:84%
like your grandmother, these
sorts of things that get

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle line:84%
said to people before
the age of seven.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:42.170 align:middle line:84%
If you repeatedly, every time
that comes up, say to yourself,

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.040 align:middle line:90%
actually, I'm my own person.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.750 align:middle line:84%
I may have elements
that resemble

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.170 align:middle line:90%
other people in my family.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:50.510 align:middle line:90%
But I can be my own person.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:54.590 align:middle line:84%
If you say that every day, 10
times a day, at some point,

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:57.200 align:middle line:84%
that's going to override
this belief that you held.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.220 align:middle line:84%
The emotional intensity
one is harder to create.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's almost like
it comes in the form of trauma

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.480 align:middle line:90%
oftentimes.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.967 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: Trauma or--

00:17:05.967 --> 00:17:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Surprise.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.925 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: So surprise.

00:17:07.925 --> 00:17:09.734 align:middle line:84%
I mean, traumatic--
if you and I went

00:17:09.734 --> 00:17:11.359 align:middle line:84%
through a traumatic
incident together--

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:13.740 align:middle line:84%
let's say something suddenly
happened in this building--

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.045 align:middle line:84%
we would bond
emotionally much more

00:17:16.045 --> 00:17:18.170 align:middle line:84%
than if we just did this
interview and nothing went

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:19.339 align:middle line:90%
wrong.

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:23.280 align:middle line:84%
So it is-- but what
you can do is--

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.730 align:middle line:84%
I know we're going to come on
to talk about visualization

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and manifestation is you can
create an image that's very

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:35.770 align:middle line:84%
emotionally important to you
about why you cannot continue

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.950 align:middle line:84%
the rest of your life
believing that you're just

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.450 align:middle line:84%
a reincarnation of
your grandmother,

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and you've got no chance
to be your own person or be

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:46.000 align:middle line:90%
different.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.160 align:middle line:84%
So you could do that
with visualization.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.290 align:middle line:90%
You could do it with journaling.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how can you add
emotion in without surprise

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.500 align:middle line:90%
and without trauma?

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.730 align:middle line:84%
How do you wire the thought
you are not your grandma.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:03.170 align:middle line:90%
You are your own being.

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:06.230 align:middle line:84%
You repeat this every day
to overwrite that program.

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Are there other tools,
frequencies, music,

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:12.410 align:middle line:84%
whatever that you can over--
dance that you can overwrite it

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:13.660 align:middle line:90%
with while you're saying this?

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: Yeah, so using
any of your senses.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.200 align:middle line:84%
We all know about
the five senses.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.320 align:middle line:84%
But there are other senses too
like our temperature sensors,

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.790 align:middle line:84%
thermoception, our pain
sensors, nociception.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And then my favorite
one is interoception,

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.680 align:middle line:84%
which is your sense of the
state of the physiology

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.400 align:middle line:90%
of the inside of your body.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.460 align:middle line:84%
So, for example,
if you think about,

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.640 align:middle line:84%
how do I feel when people
compare me to my grandmother?

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.470 align:middle line:84%
You might get butterflies
in your stomach

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:43.010 align:middle line:84%
or you might get a closed
feeling in your throat

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.020 align:middle line:90%
or crawling on your skin.

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Acknowledging that
too and managing

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:51.080 align:middle line:84%
to soothe yourself to reverse
those physical symptoms.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:57.350 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest one I would say
is that trauma and to some--

00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:00.620 align:middle line:84%
surprise is kind of in
between on this spectrum

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:01.820 align:middle line:90%
of basic human emotions.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.690 align:middle line:90%
You've seen it in the book.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:08.900 align:middle line:84%
So, mostly, trauma pushes
us into the stress side

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:09.900 align:middle line:90%
of those emotions.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:14.030 align:middle line:84%
So it makes us feel things like
fear, anger, shame, sadness,

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.080 align:middle line:90%
disgust.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And, when we feel
those emotions,

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.270 align:middle line:84%
we have higher levels of
the stress hormone cortisol.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And that affects the blood
flow around the brain.

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And it affects which
brain pathways really

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:29.250 align:middle line:84%
come to the fore, so the ones
that were put there by trauma.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.700 align:middle line:84%
If you find ways
to move yourself

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.650 align:middle line:84%
away from those
emotions to love,

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:37.460 align:middle line:84%
to trust, to gratitude,
to joy, then you

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.410 align:middle line:90%
allow oxytocin to flourish.

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:41.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's the bonding hormone.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.450 align:middle line:84%
It makes you feel like
you can lower your guard.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:46.280 align:middle line:90%
You can take healthy risks.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's a lifelong practice.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.520 align:middle line:90%
That can come through gratitude.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.020 align:middle line:90%
It can come through journaling.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.600 align:middle line:84%
But it has to also
come through--

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.900 align:middle line:84%
when you feel triggered by
your trauma, that you can say,

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm safe.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:19:59.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.190 align:middle line:84%
That you can control
your breathing,

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:04.220 align:middle line:84%
that you can try and move away
from those emotions to the ones

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.530 align:middle line:90%
that you want to overwrite with.

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right, well,
and I was just thinking

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:10.730 align:middle line:84%
if you're talking about
engaging the senses,

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.300 align:middle line:84%
you could even
have, for example,

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:16.100 align:middle line:84%
an essential oil that
represents the new pathway.

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And do that to just lift and
remind yourself and reinforce

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:20.330 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:21.870 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
ways we can do that.

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: And there's music.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.138 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And there's
music, absolutely.

00:20:24.138 --> 00:20:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I would think,
when you do like-- say

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:29.420 align:middle line:90%
a light fell on us right now.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And we were frightened
and maybe even injured,

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.500 align:middle line:90%
and we bonded on that level.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:38.960 align:middle line:84%
In real life, people bond
around bad news and trauma

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.680 align:middle line:84%
all the time and end up in
super codependent relationships.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.190 align:middle line:84%
So is it a little more difficult
when you-- on a familial level,

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:50.270 align:middle line:84%
on a family level, have bonded
through trauma to break it.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: Yeah, so especially
if it's two or more people

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:55.320 align:middle line:84%
involved because then it's not
just about you trying to break

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.120 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's
why if a family--

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:01.490 align:middle line:84%
a couple loses a child, they
often end up splitting up.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:05.138 align:middle line:84%
They just can't handle
between them the trauma.

00:21:05.138 --> 00:21:06.680 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: That's a
very specific one.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.320 align:middle line:84%
So that is-- and it's
similar in divorce.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.960 align:middle line:10%
But it's more magnified
with the loss of a child,

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.350 align:middle line:10%
that the emotional journey
for each of the parents.

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:17.270 align:middle line:10%
And let's just say for
argument's sake here

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:19.740 align:middle line:10%
that we're talking about
a heterosexual couple.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.900 align:middle line:90%
Although, it doesn't have to be.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.300 align:middle line:84%
The gender difference in
that emotional journey

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.450 align:middle line:84%
is so inexplicable
to the other person

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:29.220 align:middle line:84%
that you're dealing
with your own grief,

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.630 align:middle line:84%
but you also can't really be
there for the other person.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:34.172 align:middle line:84%
And, unfortunately, that's why
people tend to split up a lot.

00:21:34.172 --> 00:21:35.370 align:middle line:90%
It's just too hard.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.890 align:middle line:84%
But let's say it's not
something that traumatic.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's in a family
or a pair of people.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.682 align:middle line:90%
So I've been doing this--

00:21:44.682 --> 00:21:46.140 align:middle line:84%
you've been doing
this for decades.

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.307 align:middle line:84%
I've probably been doing
it for a decade and a half.

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:50.670 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
pretraining that means

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:53.940 align:middle line:84%
that, when you are confronted
with a difficult situation,

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.690 align:middle line:84%
you've already got
a way of being.

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:59.913 align:middle line:84%
So, when we were sitting here,
I'd already met you backstage.

00:21:59.913 --> 00:22:01.080 align:middle line:90%
So I wasn't nervous anymore.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.730 align:middle line:84%
But I was a bit
before I met you.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.890 align:middle line:84%
But, when you were just
finalizing your notes,

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.800 align:middle line:84%
I was just looking at you and
thinking, you're so beautiful,

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.330 align:middle line:84%
the lipstick, the
nails, the blazer.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:10.372 align:middle line:90%
And they're all matching.

00:22:10.372 --> 00:22:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was just sending
you love and gratitude.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.312 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't make
it about, am I nervous?

00:22:15.312 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen?

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:17.520 align:middle line:90%
How am I feeling?

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.380 align:middle line:84%
I just sent this little
love bubble around us.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that
is the key, I think,

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:25.950 align:middle line:84%
is we don't always have to be
at the center of our existence.

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.950 align:middle line:84%
To be able to look
out at the world

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and appreciate, like you said,
just appreciation for what

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:36.630 align:middle line:84%
you're surrounded by, what
life itself's surrounding you.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:40.320 align:middle line:84%
I find that-- well, I find
that, for myself, personally,

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.440 align:middle line:84%
one of the strategies I have
if I'm feeling blue is I

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.290 align:middle line:84%
just have to say, who
would like me to bake

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:47.640 align:middle line:90%
them a cake today or something?

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.960 align:middle line:90%
I like to bake.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I just immediately
go into the mode

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:53.467 align:middle line:84%
of doing something that
I know someone else will

00:22:53.467 --> 00:22:54.300 align:middle line:90%
love and appreciate.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'm automatically
brought up with it.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.138 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: I love that.

00:22:57.138 --> 00:22:58.680 align:middle line:84%
But, remember, what
we're both doing,

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:03.000 align:middle line:84%
actually, indirectly, is
inducing oxytocin in our brain.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, yes.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.360 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: So that's one--
it's one of those things where

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.420 align:middle line:84%
it's OK to be a bit selfish
because, by doing something

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.730 align:middle line:84%
nice for somebody else or
even thinking something nice

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.910 align:middle line:84%
for someone else, you're
actually pushing your brain

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:19.180 align:middle line:84%
into the trust
and love emotions.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So to be part
of something, to give,

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.660 align:middle line:84%
to appreciate automatically
starts the flow

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.650 align:middle line:90%
of the oxytocin.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's-- our society seems
to be a little low on our tank

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.350 align:middle line:90%
of oxytocin right now at large.

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: Yeah, when we see the
fabric of society break down,

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:38.730 align:middle line:84%
whether it's crime or just
people not pulling together

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:43.140 align:middle line:84%
over a crisis, we know
that oxytocin, in society,

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.330 align:middle line:84%
societal levels of
oxytocin are low.

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:84%
For ourselves, loneliness
has been a big issue

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:53.648 align:middle line:84%
recently because we get oxytocin
from physical affection.

00:23:53.648 --> 00:23:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: During
lockdown, it was almost--

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.523 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: It was terrible.

00:23:56.523 --> 00:23:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It was
psychologically criminal that

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.600 align:middle line:84%
people ended up
feeling as they did.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.890 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: I know.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:04.440 align:middle line:84%
So what I spoke a lot
about, from my psychological

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.200 align:middle line:84%
background, during
that time, was bathing

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.210 align:middle line:84%
because immersing
yourself in warm water

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:10.830 align:middle line:90%
is like getting a hug.

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Self-massage, so even just like
applying lotion to your body.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.080 align:middle line:90%


00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.847 align:middle line:84%
And if you did-- if you
were not completely alone--

00:24:20.847 --> 00:24:22.680 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people got
dogs for that reason

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.100 align:middle line:84%
as well because you
can get the oxytocin.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.050 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not
completely alone,

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:26.940 align:middle line:84%
making that extra
effort to be physically

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.950 align:middle line:84%
affectionate with
your family members.

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:30.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, OK, good.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.880 align:middle line:84%
So we've hit what happens when
you reinforce negative thinking

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.680 align:middle line:90%
and patterns.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.510 align:middle line:84%
We've already gotten
a little bit of what

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:38.460 align:middle line:90%
you can do to overwrite them.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.750 align:middle line:90%
But there's a lot more.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:43.110 align:middle line:84%
We're only going to just scratch
the surface of your book.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:45.210 align:middle line:84%
I highly encourage
people to get the book

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and to give it to
anyone who is looking

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:49.380 align:middle line:84%
to change their
patterned thinking

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and to expand and
transform their life.

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:53.460 align:middle line:84%
You've really done
phenomenal work.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.147 align:middle line:84%
So I'm-- big
endorsement from me.

00:24:55.147 --> 00:24:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: Thank you.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.147 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that's why
all the dog-eared pages.

00:24:58.147 --> 00:25:00.660 align:middle line:84%
So let's get to the brain
optimization part of this.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And what we start
doing, what we need

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.590 align:middle line:84%
to do on a really
basic level now

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:07.590 align:middle line:84%
to give our brain the nutrients
it needs so we can start

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.540 align:middle line:90%
this next part of the journey.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: Yeah, so it will
sound very, very basic.

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:16.080 align:middle line:84%
But, like I said, in the
last decade and a half,

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.620 align:middle line:84%
I still see so many people,
including high-powered people,

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.480 align:middle line:84%
that are not doing
these basic things,

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.970 align:middle line:84%
that I have to keep
repeating them.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:27.420 align:middle line:84%
So I like to put them into
five categories, which is rest,

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:31.390 align:middle line:84%
fuel, hydrate,
oxygenate, and simplify.

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.410 align:middle line:84%
So rest is mostly
sleep overnight

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.990 align:middle line:84%
because there's some Nobel
Science prize winning

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:39.660 align:middle line:84%
research from 2012
that shows that there's

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.300 align:middle line:84%
an active cleansing process
of the brain overnight

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.410 align:middle line:90%
that takes 7 to 8 hours.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:47.430 align:middle line:84%
So we actually need to be
in bed for 7 to 9 hours

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:50.860 align:middle line:84%
to allow that process to
fully flush out the toxins

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:51.660 align:middle line:90%
that it does.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:54.780 align:middle line:84%
So we used to think
it was like the fluid

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.150 align:middle line:84%
around the brain trickled
through the ventricles

00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:01.830 align:middle line:84%
in the brain and very passively
just cleaned out the wear

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:03.960 align:middle line:90%
and tear of daily stressors.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.960 align:middle line:84%
But, actually, it's a forcible
flushing out of toxins which

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.770 align:middle line:84%
are the exact same pathologies
we see in neurodegenerative

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:12.733 align:middle line:84%
diseases like Alzheimer's
and Parkinson's.

00:26:12.733 --> 00:26:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: So tau proteins,
beta-amyloid plaques,

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.330 align:middle line:90%
neurofibrillary tangles.

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:21.990 align:middle line:84%
If that process isn't allowed
to do the cleaning overnight

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:27.330 align:middle line:84%
on a regular basis, we start to
see those sorts of pathologies

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:28.650 align:middle line:90%
growing in the brain.

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:32.325 align:middle line:84%
And the best position for
that cleaning is on your side.

00:26:32.325 --> 00:26:34.200 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if
it's your left or right,

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.660 align:middle line:84%
but that's better than sleeping
on your front or your back.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, I
wrote a note here.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:40.440 align:middle line:90%
The glymphatic system.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.900 align:middle line:84%
I'd never heard this
or read this before.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.940 align:middle line:90%
This is new.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm a side sleeper, fortunately.

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:50.470 align:middle line:84%
But I have a little side
pillow with an ear hole in it.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:52.830 align:middle line:90%
But tell-- my Womfy.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.290 align:middle line:84%
But, anyway, tell
us why that is.

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:56.290 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: So you've heard of the
lymphatic system in the body,

00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:59.750 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:01.960 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly the
same kind of system.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.050 align:middle line:84%
But because we have glial
cells in our brain--

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.580 align:middle line:84%
they named it the
glymphatic system.

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason that
side sleeping is important

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.400 align:middle line:84%
is because of the
way that your veins

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.210 align:middle line:84%
are positioned when your neck is
slightly stretched to one side.

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:19.620 align:middle line:84%
It helps to dump the toxins
into the blood and lymph systems

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.240 align:middle line:84%
so that your body
can excrete it.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:23.380 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love it.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:24.870 align:middle line:90%
What about foods?

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:27.270 align:middle line:90%
Because you say eat dark foods.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:29.580 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen anyone
say eat dark foods.

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.190 align:middle line:84%
Fluffy, green, all
this, but not dark.

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: So I
would say with food,

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.700 align:middle line:84%
so think of it as a computer
game, and there are levels.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.637 align:middle line:84%
So the lowest level is just
that you're eating regularly.

00:27:39.637 --> 00:27:40.720 align:middle line:90%
You're fueling your brain.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Your brain is a tiny
percentage of your whole body.

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:45.450 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very
energy-hungry organ.

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:49.740 align:middle line:84%
It's using up 20% of what you
eat today when you're asleep.

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you are
focused on a task,

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:55.270 align:middle line:84%
it's using up 25% of
your dietary intake.

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And if we're stressed, it can
use up to 30% of what we eat.

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I'll come to
the dark foods piece.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:04.005 align:middle line:84%
But what I mainly
say is that we all

00:28:04.005 --> 00:28:06.130 align:middle line:84%
think about what I should
eat because of my weight.

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:08.005 align:middle line:84%
What I should eat if I
want to put on muscle.

00:28:08.005 --> 00:28:10.270 align:middle line:90%
What I should eat to be healthy.

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:11.820 align:middle line:84%
But what about,
what should you eat

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.820 align:middle line:84%
so that you can perform
optimally at your job,

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.710 align:middle line:84%
that you can be there
for your family,

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:18.820 align:middle line:84%
that you can manage
your emotions?

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have got a
healthy, balanced, regular

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:24.750 align:middle line:84%
diet, mostly plant-based--
we're supposed

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:27.870 align:middle line:84%
to eat 30 different
plants a week.

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:32.230 align:middle line:84%
It counts-- you count, coffee,
tea, rice and other grains,

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:33.810 align:middle line:90%
nuts and seeds and spices.

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:35.695 align:middle line:90%
It's not as hard as it sounds.

00:28:35.695 --> 00:28:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm trying to think
of 30 different vegetables

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.410 align:middle line:90%
a week.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:39.180 align:middle line:90%
No, that's not--

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: No, that's
what I thought at first.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.217 align:middle line:84%
But I did a food
diary for a week.

00:28:42.217 --> 00:28:43.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not as bad as you think.

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:45.660 align:middle line:84%
After that, we can
start looking at things

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.400 align:middle line:90%
like time-restricted eating.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.740 align:middle line:84%
So having the 16-hour
fast overnight or even

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.810 align:middle line:84%
just a 12-hour fast
overnight and eating

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:53.940 align:middle line:90%
within a time window.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And then, on top of that, we can
also do intermittent fasting,

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.660 align:middle line:84%
which is actually restricting
calories two nonconsecutive

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:02.910 align:middle line:84%
days of the week, but
only if you've already

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:04.770 align:middle line:90%
got a good foundation.

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And then, in terms
of neuroplasticity,

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:09.210 align:middle line:84%
which we'll come
to, one of the ways

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.680 align:middle line:84%
that that works in the
brain is neurogenesis,

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.830 align:middle line:84%
which is growing
embryonic or baby nerve

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:16.000 align:middle line:90%
cells into fully formed cells.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And one of the biggest
contributors to that

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:21.660 align:middle line:84%
is the polyphenols, special
types of antioxidants

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.920 align:middle line:90%
in dark-skinned foods.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So that means choose blueberries
instead of strawberries.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Choose purple-sprouting broccoli
instead of green broccoli.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Coffee and dark
chocolate also counts.

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:34.430 align:middle line:90%
So that's good.

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:35.570 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That works.

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'm all right on
some of those groups.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: Yeah, and
then black beans.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What about kale?

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.642 align:middle line:84%
You'd want the darker,
leafy greens in that case?

00:29:41.642 --> 00:29:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: Maybe the
cavolo nero, the black--

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:46.375 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then
what about beets?

00:29:46.375 --> 00:29:47.175 align:middle line:90%
Red.

00:29:47.175 --> 00:29:48.750 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: Beets are very good.

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:49.823 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, eat greens.

00:29:49.823 --> 00:29:51.240 align:middle line:84%
We're not saying
don't eat greens.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.520 align:middle line:84%
But if you're really taking
it to the next level,

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.962 align:middle line:90%
the darker skin--

00:29:54.962 --> 00:29:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, and then I'm just
looking at the time.

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:01.080 align:middle line:84%
We have a thousand
things to talk about.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.288 align:middle line:90%
People have to read the book.

00:30:02.288 --> 00:30:04.170 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're going to
hit the main parts.

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:07.210 align:middle line:84%
So let's finish up
on this brain health,

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.090 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll go to
the neuroplasticity

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:10.230 align:middle line:90%
and to the visioning.

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:13.140 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
skip over all the rest.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:15.660 align:middle line:84%
So talk about the other
factors in making sure.

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:16.710 align:middle line:90%
And we'll keep it brief.

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:18.377 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: I'll just
keep it super brief.

00:30:18.377 --> 00:30:21.270 align:middle line:84%
But hydration is more
important than we realize.

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:24.030 align:middle line:84%
When we're 1 to 3%
dehydrated, then

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:26.880 align:middle line:84%
our ability to focus and
concentrate and recall facts

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.990 align:middle line:90%
is affected.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And, by the time you're
thirsty, you're way more than 3%

00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:31.320 align:middle line:90%
dehydrated.

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.020 align:middle line:84%
So we should drink
half a liter of water

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:37.950 align:middle line:84%
for every 30 pounds of our
body weight per day roughly.

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And then oxygenation
is about exercise

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:44.490 align:middle line:84%
if you've already
got a good basis.

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:46.890 align:middle line:84%
But if even that
seems too difficult,

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:48.390 align:middle line:90%
it's actually about breathing.

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:52.560 align:middle line:84%
When we're stressed, we breathe
shallow, or we hold our breath.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And the resources
for the brain are

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:58.170 align:middle line:84%
glucose from a healthy,
balanced diet and oxygen.

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:01.980 align:middle line:84%
So even just 10 deep breaths
at your desk, but, ideally, not

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.510 align:middle line:90%
being sedentary.

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:05.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And then
peaceful practices.

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: So simplicity is about
mindfulness and bringing some

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.340 align:middle line:90%
quiet time into your life.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:18.420 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like
people do 10 minutes

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:19.860 align:middle line:90%
of meditation and the rest--

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:23.190 align:middle line:84%
23 hours 50 minutes of their
life is busy and stressful.

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:25.530 align:middle line:84%
So I really feel that
integrating those things,

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:28.920 align:middle line:84%
eating mindfully, walking
mindfully, paying attention

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.330 align:middle line:90%
to your loved ones.

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Bringing that into life
like more of a patchwork,

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:36.020 align:middle line:84%
that's the ideal in
terms of brain health.

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so it's not
enough just to sleep at night

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.640 align:middle line:84%
and have all these toxic
dumps happening and refreshing

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.440 align:middle line:90%
the brain.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.952 align:middle line:84%
You have to actually do that
while you're alert and awake.

00:31:44.952 --> 00:31:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: And the reason is--

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:46.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Find a way.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.307 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: Because we
kind of think, why?

00:31:48.307 --> 00:31:49.740 align:middle line:90%
Why do we have to do that?

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.210 align:middle line:84%
But, when we lived in the cave,
we walked barefoot in nature.

00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:55.400 align:middle line:84%
We looked at the stars
in the sky at night.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.680 align:middle line:84%
We sat around the
campfire with our family.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.760 align:middle line:90%
Now, we're always multitasking.

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.300 align:middle line:90%
We're always on our devices.

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:06.690 align:middle line:84%
We think that going for a
walk or listening to a podcast

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:07.490 align:middle line:90%
is a break.

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:09.620 align:middle line:84%
But, actually, you're
still doing something.

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:13.520 align:middle line:84%
We need some time to
just be, especially

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.710 align:middle line:84%
in the modern stressful
world and especially

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:18.437 align:middle line:84%
after the last few years with
the pandemic and everything.

00:32:18.437 --> 00:32:20.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's been
so difficult. Globally,

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:23.750 align:middle line:84%
it's been so difficult. OK,
when we're talking about

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:27.680 align:middle line:84%
the pathways to thinking and
noradrenaline and all of that,

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.330 align:middle line:84%
people need to read the book
and find the rest of that

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:31.130 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: We kind
of covered that.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.640 align:middle line:84%
So I talked about the
stressful emotion is cortisol,

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.290 align:middle line:90%
the trusting emotion's oxytocin.

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And surprise, which is in
between, is noradrenaline,

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:42.790 align:middle line:84%
and it augments either
of the other hormones.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: There is an--

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:46.520 align:middle line:84%
and the whole portion
you wrote on emotions

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:50.420 align:middle line:84%
and the emotional part of the
brain, of the mind complex,

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.700 align:middle line:90%
that part is super important.

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And, again, I encourage
people to read the book

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:57.800 align:middle line:84%
to see how it overlays because
I do want to get to the vision

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.320 align:middle line:84%
boarding part because
you and I, I've been

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.850 align:middle line:90%
vision boarding for decades.

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
this is so fun.

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:05.570 align:middle line:90%
It's so easy.

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:08.330 align:middle line:84%
But I did it a
very specific way.

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed a lot
of the people that

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.650 align:middle line:84%
did the boards with me,
their boards didn't turn out.

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:14.270 align:middle line:90%
You do it a way--

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:17.720 align:middle line:84%
well, you started doing
it a way that was really

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.590 align:middle line:90%
quite opposite how I do it.

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:20.910 align:middle line:90%
But it works.

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:23.262 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about those
vision boarding techniques.

00:33:23.262 --> 00:33:25.220 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you mine really
quickly because we're

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:26.420 align:middle line:90%
going to get into yours.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:29.060 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, it was
about you gather

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:31.310 align:middle line:84%
your images, your magazines,
and your little glue

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:33.080 align:middle line:90%
sticks and your poster board.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.967 align:middle line:90%
And I would tell people--

00:33:34.967 --> 00:33:36.800 align:middle line:84%
on New Year's Eve, we
do our vision boards--

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.470 align:middle line:84%
have a little glass of champagne
if you can do that, and relax.

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And, when you go through,
you only tear out images

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:45.920 align:middle line:84%
with-- you don't
halt. You don't think.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.030 align:middle line:90%
You don't analyze.

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:49.430 align:middle line:84%
You spontaneously
tear out those things

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:51.800 align:middle line:84%
that make you have
butterflies and joy.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else gets torn out.

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And, in doing that,
I was allowing

00:33:56.810 --> 00:34:00.120 align:middle line:84%
my higher self to speak
through my heart and body.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And so, for me,
everything came out.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.930 align:middle line:84%
It always did because it was
that spontaneous connection

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:09.770 align:middle line:84%
between higher self
and my conscious world.

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:12.543 align:middle line:84%
Now, other people didn't
have the same results.

00:34:12.543 --> 00:34:14.210 align:middle line:84%
But they were looking
at it, cutting out

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:17.449 align:middle line:84%
lots of words, for example,
and motivational stuff,

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:18.810 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't working.

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:22.040 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk
about how we take all

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.480 align:middle line:90%
of your scientific information.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:27.350 align:middle line:84%
You take it into an action
board and your process.

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:29.989 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: OK, so,
funnily enough,

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:32.270 align:middle line:84%
your process and my process
is actually quite similar.

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:34.550 align:middle line:84%
But I think we've come
to it from different ways

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:35.639 align:middle line:90%
of thinking.

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:38.989 align:middle line:84%
So I call it an action board
rather than a vision board

00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:42.139 align:middle line:84%
primarily because
there is this old idea

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:44.540 align:middle line:84%
that you can create fantasy
images and then sit at home

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:47.040 align:middle line:84%
and do nothing, and
somehow they'll come true.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Old way.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:52.280 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: Yeah, new way is
that, with your unlimited brain

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:57.260 align:middle line:84%
potential, you can take agency
and prime your brain to go out

00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:59.990 align:middle line:84%
into the real world and
notice and grasp opportunities

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:02.150 align:middle line:84%
to bring those
things closer to you.

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:03.680 align:middle line:84%
But the really
critical factor is

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.740 align:middle line:84%
what you've mentioned, which
is they must be things that you

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:11.120 align:middle line:84%
truly, truly desire with your
head, your heart, and your gut,

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.240 align:middle line:84%
not the things that
people expect you to do,

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.777 align:middle line:84%
not the things that
society says you should.

00:35:16.777 --> 00:35:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's where
a lot of people go wrong.

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.318 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you
said they choose

00:35:20.318 --> 00:35:24.890 align:middle line:84%
the motivational statements,
that's what we're fed

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:26.240 align:middle line:90%
that that's what we should--

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Personally, I don't
like motivational statements.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't like it when they
pop up in my social media.

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:36.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm not motivated
by those words.

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:40.460 align:middle line:84%
I'll be motivated by
an image or a sound.

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: And, also, I'm
guessing that, like me,

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:46.220 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of work going
on in the background all year

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.570 align:middle line:90%
about what you really do want.

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:49.070 align:middle line:84%
So, when it comes
to New Year's Eve,

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:51.500 align:middle line:84%
that's how you know with
your gut and your heart.

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And the people who are
looking and thinking,

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:56.280 align:middle line:84%
that's because they
haven't done that prework.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And so it's staying up here
in their logical brain.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't sink
down into the subconscious,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.920 align:middle line:84%
then it's not going to
happen when you're out

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.750 align:middle line:84%
in the real world
because if you're only

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:07.667 align:middle line:84%
using your logical brain,
then you're thinking

00:36:07.667 --> 00:36:09.020 align:middle line:90%
about what you need to do next.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:12.320 align:middle line:84%
You're not thinking about,
what's going to make me thrive?

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.810 align:middle line:84%
What's going to make
me live my best life?

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:17.150 align:middle line:84%
What's going to bring in the
things that I really want?

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:21.062 align:middle line:84%
That needs to be going on
under the radar all the time so

00:36:21.062 --> 00:36:22.520 align:middle line:84%
that, when there's
something that's

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.280 align:middle line:84%
triggered by the visual
imagery that you've created,

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.640 align:middle line:84%
you think, oh, well, actually,
that's an opportunity

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:32.450 align:middle line:90%
to bring me closer to X.

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:34.770 align:middle line:84%
There's also something
called the Tetris effect,

00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:38.030 align:middle line:84%
which people of a certain age
who played the Game Boy in bed

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:41.428 align:middle line:84%
when they were little, when
you had to go to sleep,

00:36:41.428 --> 00:36:43.220 align:middle line:84%
you could still see
the bricks falling down

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.690 align:middle line:90%
in your mind's eye.

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And so keeping your
vision board by your bed

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:49.815 align:middle line:84%
so that it's the last thing and
the first thing that you see--

00:36:49.815 --> 00:36:50.690 align:middle line:90%
last thing at night--

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:52.357 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Kind of
hypnagogic state too.

00:36:52.357 --> 00:36:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: Yeah, hypnagogic
and hypnopompic.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:56.912 align:middle line:84%
So, when you go from
waking to sleeping

00:36:56.912 --> 00:36:59.120 align:middle line:84%
and sleeping to waking,
that's when your subconscious

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.210 align:middle line:90%
is really impressionable.

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So when you open your
eyes and you see those images,

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.540 align:middle line:84%
you're soaking it in
on all levels of mind.

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: Yeah, every day
at least twice a day, which,

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:10.880 align:middle line:84%
again, means that,
when you're out there--

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.338 align:middle line:84%
because of the way that your
brain filters out data that it

00:37:13.338 --> 00:37:17.450 align:middle line:84%
doesn't think is important and
the way that it tags certain

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:20.390 align:middle line:84%
things in order of importance,
through both your logical

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:24.500 align:middle line:84%
and your emotional system,
you're setting that system up

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.080 align:middle line:84%
to put little flags on
things that are related

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.510 align:middle line:84%
to your pictures on
your vision board.

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What I noticed too--

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and, years ago, I dove into
the study of color therapy.

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:37.130 align:middle line:90%
And it was a past life thing.

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And, when I came in touch with
the concept in this lifetime,

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:42.660 align:middle line:90%
I just had to go in head first.

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.930 align:middle line:84%
So what I noticed is
in the vision boards--

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:47.390 align:middle line:84%
and, thinking back on it,
you may have noticed too--

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:50.840 align:middle line:84%
that, certain years, there
are dominant color themes

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.030 align:middle line:84%
that come up where
every image I chose

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:55.100 align:middle line:84%
had, say, a blue or
lavender background.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And, another year, they were
red or yellow and orange.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Each one of those are
very specific for what

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:06.890 align:middle line:84%
our being, our higher mind
is calling forth from us

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:08.790 align:middle line:90%
to set a tone.

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about this off-camera.

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And, as you say, well, that's
also chakric engagement.

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: I think it is.

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:16.693 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Is it chakra?

00:38:16.693 --> 00:38:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: Well,
I'm saying it in--

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I always
say "shakra."

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: I'm saying
in my English accent,

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:21.017 align:middle line:90%
so I'm saying chakra.

00:38:21.017 --> 00:38:22.850 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying shakra,
which sounds to me

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:23.808 align:middle line:90%
so much more beautiful.

00:38:23.808 --> 00:38:25.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: But is it ch or sha?

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:29.055 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: In the Indian
languages, it would be cha.

00:38:29.055 --> 00:38:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so we're also--
that's bringing in chakric

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.580 align:middle line:90%
information and desire.

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:37.790 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: And it's so
what I call nonconscious.

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:41.300 align:middle line:84%
So you obviously know that
there's an imbalance somewhere.

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And so you're attracted
to that color.

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.970 align:middle line:84%
In that year by reinforcing
that and seeing that,

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:51.200 align:middle line:84%
you're going to balance that
aspect, that chakra out.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: And I just want
to make sure that I say,

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:57.200 align:middle line:84%
to back you up, that I really
encourage people not to use any

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:00.500 align:middle line:84%
words on their vision board
because that's immediately

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.510 align:middle line:90%
engaging your logical brain.

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So, ideally, they
should be literal but--

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:08.400 align:middle line:84%
or metaphorical representations
of things that you want.

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.703 align:middle line:84%
So I could look at
your board and not

00:39:10.703 --> 00:39:11.870 align:middle line:90%
actually know what it means.

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Like, I had a unicorn
on my board last year.

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And there was an
interpretation of what

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.473 align:middle line:84%
that meant for me that
could be completely

00:39:18.473 --> 00:39:19.640 align:middle line:90%
different for somebody else.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.182 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and I remember
reading in your book something

00:39:22.182 --> 00:39:26.273 align:middle line:84%
about a horse that was glossy
rising up out of the water.

00:39:26.273 --> 00:39:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And you didn't know what
it meant at the time.

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:29.840 align:middle line:90%
And I would choose that way too.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.580 align:middle line:84%
But it meant something
that turned out

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:33.290 align:middle line:90%
to be almost specific.

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:35.610 align:middle line:90%
Talk about it.

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:36.770 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: That was this--

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:40.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was just so
beautiful that I just chose

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:43.562 align:middle line:90%
only that image as my board.

00:39:43.562 --> 00:39:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually
the year that I

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:46.250 align:middle line:90%
incorporated my business.

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:48.530 align:middle line:84%
I went from being just
a freelance person

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:50.190 align:middle line:90%
to having a proper company.

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And so the word stable is
associated with a horse.

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:56.670 align:middle line:90%
So, in my mind, it was stable.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:58.040 align:middle line:90%
It was loyalty.

00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:58.970 align:middle line:90%
I had a team.

00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:00.470 align:middle line:84%
But the horse was
kicking up water.

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:01.637 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Kicking up water.

00:40:01.637 --> 00:40:04.010 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: And you
say you're a rebel.

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:06.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, I wanted to cause some
disruption in my industry.

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:08.642 align:middle line:90%
Coaching was just what it was.

00:40:08.642 --> 00:40:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want
to fit into that.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.620 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be different and
make it something different.

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
psychologists and business

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:16.550 align:middle line:90%
people that become coaches.

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:18.830 align:middle line:84%
But I was the only
former psychiatrist.

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:20.860 align:middle line:90%
So I was kind of odd.

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And that worried
me for a few years.

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:26.510 align:middle line:84%
And, in the end, I thought,
well, that makes me different.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And I used to use heart
rate variability technology

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.590 align:middle line:84%
way before everyone
else started using it.

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:33.030 align:middle line:90%
So there was that.

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:36.260 align:middle line:84%
But that picture was
actually an advert

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:40.280 align:middle line:84%
for a certain brand, a very
desirable brand for women,

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.950 align:middle line:84%
which, at the time,
I never ever thought

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:44.280 align:middle line:90%
I would be able to afford.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.613 align:middle line:84%
So it was irrelevant to
me that it was that brand.

00:40:46.613 --> 00:40:47.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It was the image.

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>> SWART: But years later,
I got a handbag from--

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.900 align:middle line:90%
a purse from that brand.

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And I thought back, and I was
like, wow, years ago-- yeah.

00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I did it.

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:00.740 align:middle line:84%
So we only have a
minute or so left.

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And we left out-- we
started, and we ended.

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:05.960 align:middle line:84%
But we left out everything
in between in the book

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.760 align:middle line:84%
because there's so
much good information.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:11.810 align:middle line:84%
But this was designed also as
not just a guide and not just

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:13.970 align:middle line:90%
to educate but as a workbook.

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:18.230 align:middle line:84%
It guides people in how we go
about the reformation of how

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:20.690 align:middle line:84%
our brain is functioning,
transformation.

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:22.320 align:middle line:90%
Any final thoughts on that?

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.850 align:middle line:10%
>> SWART: Yeah, absolutely,
I think that it's one thing

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:26.685 align:middle line:10%
to read the book.

00:41:26.685 --> 00:41:29.060 align:middle line:10%
But if you really want to
change your life, if you really

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:31.340 align:middle line:10%
want to transform your
brain, if you really

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:33.440 align:middle line:10%
want to reinvent
yourself, then there's

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.250 align:middle line:10%
four chapters at the
end that take you

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:37.230 align:middle line:10%
through all the
exercises, including

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:38.760 align:middle line:10%
making the action board.

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:42.270 align:middle line:10%
And I strongly believe
from the science backing

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:45.960 align:middle line:10%
that if somebody worked
through all of those exercises,

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.100 align:middle line:10%
their life could become--

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:47.850 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Have a new life.

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: A new life, basically.

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:50.200 align:middle line:90%
You have a new life.

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.242 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, again,
I thanked you at the top,

00:41:52.242 --> 00:41:54.000 align:middle line:84%
and I thank you
again at the bottom.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you from
the bottom of my heart

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.510 align:middle line:84%
that you've done
this for humanity

00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:59.100 align:middle line:84%
because you've done
a beautiful job.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:02.310 align:middle line:84%
I will now be recommending
this as the primary guidebook

00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:04.560 align:middle line:84%
for transformation
if you feel stuck.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: Thank you so much.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Thank
you so much, Tara.

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:07.223 align:middle line:90%
>> SWART: Thank you.

00:42:07.223 --> 00:42:09.460 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: The title of
Tara's book is "The Source,"

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:13.230 align:middle line:10%
which is a very friendly,
really easy read delving

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:14.100 align:middle line:10%
into the science.

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.310 align:middle line:90%
You can understand it.

00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:17.220 align:middle line:10%
I highly recommend it
for anyone attempting

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.320 align:middle line:10%
to get more out of their lives.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.420 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:22.920 align:middle line:10%
on "Open Minds."
