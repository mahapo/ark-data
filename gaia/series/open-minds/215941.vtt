>>REGINA MEREDITH: Mona Sobhani
says, scientific materialism

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.690 align:middle line:10%
can no longer be the
standard of science.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.690 align:middle line:10%
It's been proved beyond
a shadow of a doubt

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.330 align:middle line:10%
that the unseen quantum
world of intelligence

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.300 align:middle line:10%
has to be included in scientific
discovery, starting now.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, Mona's journey
was a difficult one

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.630 align:middle line:84%
because it pitted her
mind against her intuition

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.870 align:middle line:90%
as a scientist.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And so this is going to be a
wonderful conversation for those

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.480 align:middle line:84%
of you who know doubters
or are doubters yourself.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.617 align:middle line:90%
So, Mona, welcome.

00:00:46.617 --> 00:00:47.700 align:middle line:90%
I've never met you before.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.658 align:middle line:90%
This is the first time.

00:00:48.658 --> 00:00:49.810 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to Open Minds.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>>MONA SOBHANI: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.393 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
took a brave journey

00:00:53.393 --> 00:00:55.350 align:middle line:84%
because you're from
a Persian family.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And so it's-- we were
talking off camera.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.320 align:middle line:84%
I said, were you always
a little sciencey kid?

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Because you took this
all, and you said, no.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.460 align:middle line:10%
>>SOBHANI: Mm-mm, science
was my worst subject,

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.110 align:middle line:10%
those standardized tests
that you take every year.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.560 align:middle line:10%
I had, like, the highest
percentile for every subject.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And then science would
be like 70 out of 100.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.760 align:middle line:10%
And it was mostly because I just
wasn't interested in the science

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.080 align:middle line:10%
that they were teaching us.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.287 align:middle line:10%
It'd be like geology or weather
patterns or whatever it was,

00:01:23.287 --> 00:01:24.620 align:middle line:10%
and I wasn't interested in that.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.180 align:middle line:10%
So it wasn't until I found
neuroscience in, I think,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.890 align:middle line:10%
my 12th grade--

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.910 align:middle line:10%
I think it was 12th grade when
I started to get interested

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.000 align:middle line:10%
in science, actually.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah
started lighting up.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, so even though your
family, which is your

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.230 align:middle line:84%
to be successful, you
need a good career path.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.930 align:middle line:84%
You choose science,
not art, right?

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:44.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yes.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Or literature.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah, and
I'm Persian, so it's--

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.620 align:middle line:90%
we're either lawyers or doctors.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.640 align:middle line:90%
That's the choice.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so you
chose the doctor path.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.670 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: But what's
interesting to me

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.320 align:middle line:10%
in reading about you
is that your mother,

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.780 align:middle line:10%
the matrilineal part of your
family were very intuitive

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.450 align:middle line:10%
and used old school practices
with their intuition.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.340 align:middle line:84%
So bring us into that world
of coffee ground readings

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.930 align:middle line:90%
from grandma and your mom.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Yes,
so in our culture,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:90%
we're actually very mystical.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.450 align:middle line:84%
The history of the Persian
lineage is very mystical,

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and one of the traditions that
was passed down was divination.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.230 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother, the
way that she practiced

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.450 align:middle line:84%
that was using coffee grinds,
like, not American coffee,

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.080 align:middle line:84%
like thicker Turkish,
Armenian, Greek coffee.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you
grind it like that.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.805 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah, and
you leave it in the cup,

00:02:31.805 --> 00:02:32.810 align:middle line:90%
so it creates pictures.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.760 align:middle line:84%
So then, the reader looks at
the pictures and intuits things

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.960 align:middle line:84%
about the person's life
past, present, or future.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.760 align:middle line:84%
So my grandma used to do
this, and she taught my mom

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.560 align:middle line:90%
how to do it.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.977 align:middle line:84%
She tried to teach
the other kids,

00:02:43.977 --> 00:02:46.160 align:middle line:84%
but they weren't
as good as my mom.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.628 align:middle line:84%
So my mom started doing it for
our family friends at parties,

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:52.670 align:middle line:84%
and I never noticed it
because I grew up with it.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.590 align:middle line:84%
So it was very in
the background.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.900 align:middle line:90%
And obviously, I was a kid.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.273 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't drinking coffee,
so I didn't notice it.

00:02:58.273 --> 00:02:59.940 align:middle line:84%
But when I started
going to grad school,

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.440 align:middle line:84%
and I would go home
on the weekends,

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.260 align:middle line:84%
she would make me coffee,
and then absentmindedly,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.190 align:middle line:84%
like, turn it over and
just start reading.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And I was in graduate
school for neuroscience.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:09.880 align:middle line:90%
So I was--

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mom.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah,
I'm a scientist.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe in this.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.440 align:middle line:84%
But she would say things,
and I would just listen,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.960 align:middle line:90%
and then I would take notes.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And over time, I
noticed that she

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.640 align:middle line:84%
would get a lot
of details right,

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and things that she would
say would come true weeks

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.870 align:middle line:90%
in advance.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.750 align:middle line:84%
They would pan out over
weeks, sometimes even months.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.123 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times they would be
things that I couldn't possibly

00:03:35.123 --> 00:03:36.040 align:middle line:90%
know they were coming.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.190 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't possibly know.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.740 align:middle line:84%
So it was the
number of variables

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.220 align:middle line:84%
that she would get correct,
the small, meaningful details

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.932 align:middle line:84%
that nobody in my
life would know,

00:03:46.932 --> 00:03:48.640 align:middle line:84%
things that I would
just think in my head

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.680 align:middle line:84%
but that were very
meaningful to.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That were
coming out the ground.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah, she
would say them out loud,

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.660 align:middle line:84%
and I would just sit
there, and sometimes there

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.950 align:middle line:84%
were things I would not
want my mom to know.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Like, I would
purposely not tell her.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can't keep
secrets from that kind of mom.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: So yeah, you--

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, yeah,
I would not want

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.092 align:middle line:84%
to have coffee
because I'd be like, I

00:04:04.092 --> 00:04:06.147 align:middle line:90%
don't her to want to know.

00:04:06.147 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was just spying on me.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah, so I couldn't
explain it with science.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So I just lived in
cognitive dissonance

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.950 align:middle line:84%
and kind of ignored it
because I couldn't really

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.602 align:middle line:90%
reconcile the two worlds.

00:04:18.602 --> 00:04:20.310 align:middle line:84%
But I came to count
on it because she was

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.610 align:middle line:90%
more right than she was wrong.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.783 align:middle line:90%
So I knew it worked.

00:04:22.783 --> 00:04:23.950 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know how it worked.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.010 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know why,
but it was useful.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And as I
recall, you kept a diary

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.110 align:middle line:90%
for 10 years of those readings.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yes.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So at what point did
you start taking her seriously

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and start writing down
what she had told you?

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: So my
friends would fight over

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.595 align:middle line:84%
who could come over on
Sundays to get readings.

00:04:41.595 --> 00:04:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, because
they all wanted readings?

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah, they
all wanted readings.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.735 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, how old
were you by this time?

00:04:45.735 --> 00:04:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: I was
in my early 20s.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.297 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah.

00:04:48.297 --> 00:04:49.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Young adult, OK.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.067 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah,
we were, I think

00:04:52.067 --> 00:04:53.400 align:middle line:90%
that's when I started to notice.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well,
my friends really

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.620 align:middle line:84%
want to come over
for these readings.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Like, maybe I should pay
more attention to them.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's when
I started taking notes.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, also, I would forget
things that she would say,

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.710 align:middle line:84%
and then it would become hard to
be like, is that what she said?

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.310 align:middle line:90%
My memory is not reliable?

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.188 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, well,
if I want to be--

00:05:10.188 --> 00:05:11.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm in grad school
to be a scientist.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.280 align:middle line:90%
I should be taking notes.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I
started taking notes.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I tracked
it for over 10 years.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, anytime she reads for
me, I'll jot down what she says,

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.502 align:middle line:90%
if I think it's--

00:05:21.502 --> 00:05:22.710 align:middle line:90%
which that's the funny thing.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.360 align:middle line:90%
I should have learned by now.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not always what
I think is important.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.768 align:middle line:90%
It's usually-- yeah, it's--

00:05:28.768 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's something
trying to come out

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.360 align:middle line:84%
in a message for
you, and you just

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.527 align:middle line:90%
are dismissing it sometimes.

00:05:33.527 --> 00:05:34.327 align:middle line:90%
We do that.

00:05:34.327 --> 00:05:35.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Definitely.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.340 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to get
into the nature

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:84%
of a couple of the readings
that really kind of rocked you.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.640 align:middle line:90%
And it is interesting.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.070 align:middle line:84%
We all still when we
have these experiences,

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.990 align:middle line:90%
we think, how is this possible?

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Still, even those who are
experienced in this realm.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.200 align:middle line:84%
So one of them had
to do, your mom

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.760 align:middle line:84%
saw a man with beautiful,
long eyelashes.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Yes, so this was one
of the moments, I think, where--

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.280 align:middle line:90%
so I was dating somebody.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.810 align:middle line:90%
It was in my mid, early 20s.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Dating this guy, and
I remember-- to me,

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:09.900 align:middle line:90%
I loved his lashes.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.340 align:middle line:84%
They were very
long and beautiful,

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.507 align:middle line:84%
but it was not something I
said out loud to anybody.

00:06:13.507 --> 00:06:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't a common
feature I always

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.540 align:middle line:84%
liked in the guys I
was dating or anything.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.080 align:middle line:90%
It was just him specifically.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Unique to him.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.180 align:middle line:90%
But weren't you also--

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.380 align:middle line:84%
as I recall, in
your culture, you

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.930 align:middle line:84%
don't just go talking about
someone you went on a first date

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:30.300 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Oh, yeah, I
would never tell my mom.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:32.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
to-- you have to wait

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.700 align:middle line:84%
until it's very serious before
you would even mention anyone.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: That's right.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Our culture takes, I guess,
dating very seriously.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And my parents,
especially my mom,

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.300 align:middle line:84%
is pretty old-school,
so I wasn't though.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So I was just living my
life the way I wanted to

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and I just wouldn't
tell her anything.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So when she would
do the readings,

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.260 align:middle line:84%
that's what I was
referring to earlier.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.718 align:middle line:84%
Like things I wouldn't want
her to know or things like that

00:06:54.718 --> 00:06:57.900 align:middle line:84%
where she would see things and
I just wouldn't say anything.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.630 align:middle line:84%
She'd be like, well, it looks
like there's a guy in your life.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And that would just
sit there quietly.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:02.707 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Turning red.

00:07:02.707 --> 00:07:06.672 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Yes, and then so
for this guy she mentioned,

00:07:06.672 --> 00:07:08.630 align:middle line:84%
she's like, oh, and it
looks like he has really

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:09.990 align:middle line:90%
long, beautiful eyelashes.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And every time that she would
do a reading, he would show up

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.960 align:middle line:90%
and she would mention the--

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.640 align:middle line:90%
he became the lash guy.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was what it shook me
though the first time because it

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.760 align:middle line:84%
was just a thought that I had
never said out loud to anybody,

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.140 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't told anybody.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.950 align:middle line:90%
It was so weird.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were obviously
other things I liked about him.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.680 align:middle line:84%
So it was kind of
interesting that

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.390 align:middle line:84%
was like the meaningful
detail that she picked up on,

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.430 align:middle line:84%
and it became this thing
that represented him.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And that was something
I couldn't understand

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:84%
from a science perspective,
but that deeply intrigued me

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.588 align:middle line:90%
about the readings.

00:07:42.588 --> 00:07:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, oh,
I'm sure it would.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.970 align:middle line:84%
You start getting into all kinds
of entanglement theory by then.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:47.210 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, and another
one she was telling you,

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.160 align:middle line:84%
which I mean, it sounds
like a Gypsy fortune teller.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.200 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
get very bad news.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.110 align:middle line:84%
But she didn't say this
like a Gypsy fortune teller.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.290 align:middle line:84%
She was very sincere in
trying to give you a heads up.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah, so she
didn't usually give bad news.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, but it was--

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.820 align:middle line:90%
I think it was 2016.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.873 align:middle line:84%
And for a few weeks, she
was seeing something,

00:08:10.873 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and she would get
kind of awkward.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally, she said,
I don't want to scare you,

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.330 align:middle line:84%
but I feel like I should warn
you that because I've seen it

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.400 align:middle line:84%
for a few weeks in
a row that you're

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.100 align:middle line:84%
going to get some
bad news, and that

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.110 align:middle line:84%
shook me because my mom
never said things like that.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I was like,
what do you mean?

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.380 align:middle line:84%
I tried to get more
information out of her,

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.838 align:middle line:84%
but she wouldn't
say anything else.

00:08:31.838 --> 00:08:34.400 align:middle line:84%
She was like, I don't really
know what I'm looking at,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.010 align:middle line:90%
and I don't want to--

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Program, yeah, yeah.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.335 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah, and put
it in your head, and what

00:08:41.335 --> 00:08:42.710 align:middle line:84%
if it doesn't
happen or whatever.

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle line:84%
So she's like, just
keep that in mind.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.110 align:middle line:90%
So for six weeks--

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.960 align:middle line:84%
and I told you, by this
point, I trusted her.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.010 align:middle line:90%
Like, I knew--

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.750 align:middle line:84%
I felt like it's possible
something could happen.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.180 align:middle line:84%
So for six weeks,
I kind of lived

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.100 align:middle line:84%
in this very anxious
state of like, who

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.550 align:middle line:90%
is going to give me bad news?

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And I would ask my
friends who has bad news.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.100 align:middle line:90%
And I tried to get ahead of it.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:02.950 align:middle line:90%
Of course, I didn't.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.460 align:middle line:84%
But six weeks later,
I got a message

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.870 align:middle line:84%
from one of my classmates
that-- they're like,

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:09.280 align:middle line:90%
have you heard the news?

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.330 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, I knew it.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of our
professors at USC was

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.300 align:middle line:84%
killed by one of the
students in the program,

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.930 align:middle line:84%
and it was somebody who had
worked on one of my dissertation

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:19.730 align:middle line:90%
experiments.

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was close to you.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.532 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: With me, yeah.

00:09:21.532 --> 00:09:24.310 align:middle line:84%
So it was very
upsetting, obviously,

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:27.490 align:middle line:84%
for the whole community
and for me personally.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I told my mom I was
like, I think I know what it is.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:31.630 align:middle line:90%
I think it's this.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.700 align:middle line:90%
And she said, Yeah.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.710 align:middle line:84%
So then, she's like,
I knew it was a death.

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:middle line:90%
It looked like a death.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.490 align:middle line:84%
She was like, I didn't
want to tell you,

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.060 align:middle line:90%
why get upset beforehand?

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.667 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You go
looking for things.

00:09:42.667 --> 00:09:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Right,
and she's like-- she

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.792 align:middle line:84%
said she had also
never seen anything

00:09:45.792 --> 00:09:48.420 align:middle line:84%
like it, which is
interesting because it

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.740 align:middle line:90%
was an unusual circumstance.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For a student
to kill a professor.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:51.900 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah, so
she's like, I just

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.370 align:middle line:90%
had not seen anything like it.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.590 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, so I
didn't know what it meant.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:57.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.285 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah.

00:09:57.285 --> 00:09:59.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then, we
go on, and then we'll

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.080 align:middle line:90%
wrap this phase up about mom.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:84%
But then, mom saw
a romance for you.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Right, so
that event with the death

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.130 align:middle line:84%
shook me because also
suddenly the readings were

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.740 align:middle line:84%
about life and death, which
before this, they were not.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.863 align:middle line:84%
And so that kind of
shook me and made

00:10:17.863 --> 00:10:19.030 align:middle line:90%
me think about the universe.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.912 align:middle line:84%
And is there something that
exists like fate or destiny?

00:10:22.912 --> 00:10:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Because how could the
information of your death

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.570 align:middle line:84%
be available in the
ethers ahead of time?

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.410 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't do
anything with that.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.540 align:middle line:90%
I just kind of it scared me.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And then, I went
on with my life.

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.280 align:middle line:84%
But then, if you-- it was
a couple of years later,

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.255 align:middle line:84%
I got in this relationship,
and I was like,

00:10:39.255 --> 00:10:41.130 align:middle line:90%
oh, I'm going to be happy now.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.140 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she
told you you're

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.220 align:middle line:90%
going to be in a relationship.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah, and
she had seen that.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.677 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And she said
it would be a good one.

00:10:46.677 --> 00:10:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah, she said,
and it was a good one.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.610 align:middle line:90%
And she saw all these details.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Everything was correct,
again, all the creepy details.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.750 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have eyelashes, but
she got other details about him

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.040 align:middle line:84%
correct that were
very specific to him.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, she was
like, it'll be good.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:02.940 align:middle line:90%
But then it ended.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.315 align:middle line:84%
So then, to me,
that wasn't good.

00:11:04.315 --> 00:11:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And so then it made you
start doubting things

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.845 align:middle line:90%
and put you into a dark place.

00:11:08.845 --> 00:11:11.865 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: It made me just
feel confused, I think.

00:11:11.865 --> 00:11:13.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes, definitely dark.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.280 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of
things, I think, in my life

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.850 align:middle line:90%
falling apart at that time.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:84%
It was one of those
eras where everything

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.142 align:middle line:90%
started to deconstruct.

00:11:21.142 --> 00:11:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What was happening?

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.935 align:middle line:84%
By the way, what was happening
in your professional life?

00:11:24.935 --> 00:11:29.420 align:middle line:10%
>>SOBHANI: So I had a new
job that I had started,

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.780 align:middle line:10%
but I had hit the workforce
after getting my PhD.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And I started having a bit
of an existential crisis

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.770 align:middle line:84%
because every morning,
I would wake up

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:40.220 align:middle line:90%
and think, oh no, is this it.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.410 align:middle line:10%
This is what we do
forever until we die.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.800 align:middle line:84%
We just go to work and have
no time to do anything.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What were you doing
day by day in your work?

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: I was working at
a Research Center at USC.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.140 align:middle line:84%
So I was running operations
and running the studies.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:57.280 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very,
very demanding job.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.080 align:middle line:10%
And I was working
a lot of hours.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I think
I was thinking--

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.525 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the
field of neuroscience?

00:12:03.525 --> 00:12:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah, it was
neuroscience and digital health.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And so it was just
very demanding.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:09.370 align:middle line:90%
And I started to--

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.695 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Repetitious,
probably, a bit of that?

00:12:11.695 --> 00:12:13.905 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Actually,
it was not repetitious.

00:12:13.905 --> 00:12:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's good.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.045 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Actually,
every day was a new thing.

00:12:17.045 --> 00:12:18.420 align:middle line:84%
But that also has
its challenges.

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.800 align:middle line:84%
You have to figure
things out every day.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.670 align:middle line:90%
So it was a lot.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:24.470 align:middle line:90%
It was a lot.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I just started to have
an existential crisis, I think.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And then all of those, the death
and the relationship ending

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.040 align:middle line:84%
and then a few other
things, I just fell.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And the relationship
was the final--

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:42.650 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I give up, and I
just fell into a depression.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:43.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
continued with your job

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.740 align:middle line:84%
but just struggled in your
personal life then for a while?

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.920 align:middle line:90%
I was like a zombie.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
I went mentally,

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:53.430 align:middle line:90%
but I was never present.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But this question
lingered, thinking back

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.440 align:middle line:84%
on what happened to the
Professor, foretold of six weeks

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.540 align:middle line:84%
before it happened, about free
will and destiny and mind.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:09.405 align:middle line:84%
And this became a real
area of seeking for you.

00:13:09.405 --> 00:13:10.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yes.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just launch
in and tell us all about

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.570 align:middle line:90%
that because this is a big one.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So after I was in this dark
space for a few months,

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:27.430 align:middle line:84%
I started to come
out and my mind

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:28.630 align:middle line:90%
started to come back online.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.995 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking about the
coffee because I was confused.

00:13:31.995 --> 00:13:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, sometimes it was
right, sometimes it was wrong.

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Or the interpretation,
what matters, or maybe I

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.270 align:middle line:90%
was making it up all along.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And neuroscience and
science is right.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:44.310 align:middle line:90%
We create meaning in our minds.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.380 align:middle line:90%
So I decided to start exploring.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think it wasn't
even my decision at first.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm from Los Angeles.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.430 align:middle line:84%
So I had a group of girlfriends
that I grew up with.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And we know of a
really good psychic.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.222 align:middle line:84%
And she'll turn you away If
she can't read your energy.

00:14:02.222 --> 00:14:03.555 align:middle line:90%
She turned my friend away twice.

00:14:03.555 --> 00:14:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because you didn't
want to go to your mom for this.

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:07.918 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Well, I wanted
to try something different.

00:14:07.918 --> 00:14:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I got you.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: I wanted
to explore the space

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.230 align:middle line:84%
and see how it was
for other people.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And so we went to
do these readings.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was really fascinating
because they were much more

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.370 align:middle line:90%
detailed than my mom.

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:26.200 align:middle line:84%
But they were each
good in their own ways.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.640 align:middle line:90%
But they were very detailed.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And I, of course, recorded
them and took notes.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.040 align:middle line:84%
And they got so many
variables right, again,

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.520 align:middle line:84%
for each event that I
just didn't understand

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.730 align:middle line:90%
how it could be possible.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.770 align:middle line:90%
So they blew my mind.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And that launched me
on a personal project

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:47.800 align:middle line:84%
to interview these intuitives
because I started to wonder.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.370 align:middle line:90%
Let's say, it's true.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, they're picking
up on a signal or something.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.710 align:middle line:90%
What is perceiving the signal?

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:56.510 align:middle line:90%
Is it the brain?

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And if it's the brain,
what part of the brain

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and what makes them
special and different?

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So I started to go into
science mode about it.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.640 align:middle line:84%
But I was really interested
in just talking to them

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.010 align:middle line:84%
about their experience of it
because when they do readings,

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.550 align:middle line:84%
a lot of them would say,
like, I feel it in my heart,

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.930 align:middle line:90%
or I'm seeing, or I'm hearing.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.720 align:middle line:90%
And so I had so many questions.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.900 align:middle line:90%
So I started interviewing them.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.380 align:middle line:84%
And they would also
mention in the readings,

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.880 align:middle line:84%
I forgot to mention
this, they would

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.030 align:middle line:84%
mention reincarnation and
soul lessons and soul groups.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.350 align:middle line:90%
And I did not grow up spiritual.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:35.152 align:middle line:84%
I was not exposed to any kind
of spiritual philosophy--

00:15:35.152 --> 00:15:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Any religion?

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:39.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: --or religion,
really, and especially not one

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:41.070 align:middle line:90%
that included reincarnation.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.890 align:middle line:84%
So whenever they would say
those things in the readings,

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:46.890 align:middle line:84%
I would just zone out, and
it would go over my head.

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:49.320 align:middle line:84%
But like I said, I recorded
them and wrote it down.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.070 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't know what to
do with that information.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And so when I started talking
to them and then reading,

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.580 align:middle line:90%
then a picture started to form.

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.680 align:middle line:90%
And I got curious about that.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.770 align:middle line:84%
It started to land
in my head as,

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:05.790 align:middle line:84%
like, maybe I should
look at this next.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And I also started to interview
my scientist colleagues

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.870 align:middle line:90%
because I started to feel crazy.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:14.070 align:middle line:84%
This is really the wonderful
part of your story,

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:15.870 align:middle line:84%
is you were not going
to let this one go.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.370 align:middle line:90%
You were a dog with a bone.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:19.448 align:middle line:84%
And you were going to
get to the bottom of it

00:16:19.448 --> 00:16:21.490 align:middle line:84%
because one thing you know
how to do is research.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, all right, I'll
interview these intuitives,

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.510 align:middle line:90%
get their personal experience.

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:30.150 align:middle line:84%
I asked a lot of them,
do you believe in fate,

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:32.195 align:middle line:84%
do you believe in destiny,
how does this work.

00:16:32.195 --> 00:16:35.390 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know, they
weren't as concerned

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.440 align:middle line:90%
with those questions.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And I turned to my
scientist colleagues.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.430 align:middle line:90%
They were interesting.

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.142 align:middle line:84%
They were more open-minded than
I thought that they would be.

00:16:44.142 --> 00:16:45.600 align:middle line:84%
They were more
open-minded than me.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, all of them
had had experiences

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:52.890 align:middle line:84%
or knew somebody close to
them, like a family member,

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:55.910 align:middle line:84%
like a mother who had,
or claimed to have,

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:59.040 align:middle line:84%
abilities like that,
psychic or whatnot.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.760 align:middle line:84%
So they were all very like,
well, science is a tool.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.377 align:middle line:90%
We use it to explore.

00:17:04.377 --> 00:17:05.419 align:middle line:90%
We don't know everything.

00:17:05.419 --> 00:17:09.176 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But like you said
in your book, a lot of them

00:17:09.176 --> 00:17:10.134 align:middle line:90%
were content with that.

00:17:10.134 --> 00:17:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: And they
were fine with that.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.109 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're just not
going to-- we don't know.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Some things have to
remain a mystery.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you
come in and say, no, it

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:17.640 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have to
remain a mystery.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.654 align:middle line:90%
We can figure this out.

00:17:18.654 --> 00:17:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yes.

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:22.099 align:middle line:84%
One of my dissertation
advisors is one

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:24.750 align:middle line:90%
of the people I interviewed.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And she's a psychologist
and neuroscientist

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.870 align:middle line:90%
and a genetic behaviorist.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:35.555 align:middle line:84%
And so she was like,
turned it on me.

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, it's
really fascinating

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.990 align:middle line:84%
that you can't accept a mystery
or that something would just

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.790 align:middle line:90%
be a mystery.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:42.760 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, I don't know why.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.320 align:middle line:90%
I need more than that.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But she was
happy with just a mystery,

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.410 align:middle line:84%
even though she
was overeducated.

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah.

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:51.470 align:middle line:84%
She was like, oh,
what's the big deal?

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.270 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.506 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh no, I need to know.

00:17:54.506 --> 00:17:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I love that
you had the courage and just

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:01.827 align:middle line:84%
the stamina to continue
going down that rabbit hole

00:18:01.827 --> 00:18:03.910 align:middle line:84%
because you encountered
some of my favorite people

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.470 align:middle line:90%
along the way, certainly.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:09.910 align:middle line:84%
But it's heartening
for us to know

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:13.930 align:middle line:84%
that so many of your colleagues
actually had these experiences

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and were open-minded, even
though the systems were not

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.050 align:middle line:84%
allowing them to study
it further at all.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yes.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.810 align:middle line:84%
So in private, these
were all conversations

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:25.300 align:middle line:84%
that happened over
Zoom during COVID.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And I know that some
of them would be OK

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.350 align:middle line:90%
discussing it publicly.

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.200 align:middle line:84%
But I also know that
some of them would not.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:37.570 align:middle line:84%
So there was a wide range within
all the people I spoke to,

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:38.800 align:middle line:90%
of who would be comfortable.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how many of them
wished that their field would

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.785 align:middle line:90%
allow for real discovery?

00:18:46.785 --> 00:18:48.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Some.

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:53.680 align:middle line:10%
But I think, just
like other people,

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.630 align:middle line:10%
you get in the habit and the
rut just of doing your job.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you've got
10 years down the road.

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah, not
questioning it because to do

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.080 align:middle line:90%
that would upset everything.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's, like, you finally
figure it out, the road,

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.700 align:middle line:84%
and you don't really
want to upset that.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.364 align:middle line:90%


00:19:10.364 --> 00:19:12.580 align:middle line:84%
But I will say, that
was at the beginning.

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:16.240 align:middle line:84%
As I went down the journey
further and further,

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and even people I knew
previously, but didn't

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.900 align:middle line:84%
know that they were spiritual
or open to these things,

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:27.180 align:middle line:84%
those people that I
connected with later,

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.060 align:middle line:84%
they started to have, like
me, like a fire underneath

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.590 align:middle line:84%
to be like, well, this
is just ridiculous.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:36.000 align:middle line:84%
This is really
disingenuous that we

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.540 align:middle line:84%
talk about these
things in private,

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.568 align:middle line:84%
but we don't dare
talk about them in--

00:19:39.568 --> 00:19:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Professionally.

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah, academic space.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:43.450 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make sense.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.640 align:middle line:84%
It's just there's no
integrity in that.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.730 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, it started to evolve.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.970 align:middle line:84%
I think more and more
scientists started to come out.

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So, really,
in the field of science,

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.105 align:middle line:90%
you were becoming a disruptor.

00:19:56.105 --> 00:19:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: I guess so.

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You hadn't
planned on it.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:59.627 align:middle line:84%
But that's what
we need right now,

00:19:59.627 --> 00:20:02.310 align:middle line:84%
lots of disruptors, because
the people watching this

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.450 align:middle line:84%
know this paradigm
has to change.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.210 align:middle line:84%
We can't live on
this old science.

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:07.430 align:middle line:90%
It's worn out.

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah,
it's very limited.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's very limited.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:13.240 align:middle line:84%
It has its purpose,
but it's so incomplete.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And so you were
looking as to how you

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.050 align:middle line:90%
might be able to flesh it out.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get to where you
landed with all of this

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:21.000 align:middle line:90%
besides writing the book.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.990 align:middle line:84%
So this ultimately took you when
you were doing your interviews

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:27.370 align:middle line:90%
to Russell Targ, whom I love.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:33.588 align:middle line:84%
And I worked with him
initially, I think 1985 or 1986.

00:20:33.588 --> 00:20:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere in there was my
first interview with him when

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.850 align:middle line:84%
they were doing those famous
Russian experiments that he

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:42.330 align:middle line:84%
was famous for, which was they
were doing remote viewing.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And the kicker was
into the future.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they had very,
very good psychics at the time.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I was fascinated
with it and put it

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.990 align:middle line:84%
on the news when I was
a little news anchor.

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And so you ran into
him decades later.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And then he shared some things
with you that, I'm sure,

00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.440 align:middle line:90%
opened your eyes.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.650 align:middle line:84%
But also, we're going to get
to another fellow in a minute.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:04.860 align:middle line:84%
So what did you take
away from Russell?

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.455 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: So it was Hal Puthoff
that I spoke to, actually.

00:21:07.455 --> 00:21:08.398 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, Hal.

00:21:08.398 --> 00:21:09.440 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was Russell.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.035 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: But in my mind,
they're very closely related.

00:21:12.035 --> 00:21:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They are, very.

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Same
program, so yeah.

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:17.230 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.990 align:middle line:84%
It was awesome because
that was really early on.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.813 align:middle line:84%
I think I had just read the
papers that they had published.

00:21:22.813 --> 00:21:24.230 align:middle line:84%
There were a couple
they published

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.250 align:middle line:90%
in big science journals.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:30.140 align:middle line:84%
I think it was literally Nature
or maybe Science and then

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.800 align:middle line:90%
the Electrical Engineering one.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.060 align:middle line:90%
And I was really blown away.

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.140 align:middle line:90%
I was really impressed.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked to speak with
them to discern if he was nuts.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:43.590 align:middle line:84%
Because I was still in that
phase, where I was like,

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:44.670 align:middle line:90%
are all these people--

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:45.610 align:middle line:90%
is this a conspiracy?

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:47.245 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is this
legit scientists?

00:21:47.245 --> 00:21:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.910 align:middle line:90%
But he blew my socks off.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was
talking about things.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, he's a
physicist, and I'm not.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.720 align:middle line:84%
So he talks about a lot of
things I have no idea about.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.840 align:middle line:84%
So I just took
copious notes and went

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.530 align:middle line:90%
to research it all afterward.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:05.540 align:middle line:84%
But he explained the
experiments that they did to me

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.780 align:middle line:84%
and what he witnessed
and even more stories

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:13.340 align:middle line:84%
around the research, like all
the people and the interactions

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.550 align:middle line:90%
with the government.

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, the CIA was
supporting that operation.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So obviously,
there's some value in it

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.570 align:middle line:84%
because they're spending a
lot of covert money on it.

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:24.237 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: That's
what really got to me.

00:22:24.237 --> 00:22:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Because in my job, we
worked with the military,

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.730 align:middle line:90%
and we applied for grants.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And we had funding
from the government.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And they do not
give money easily,

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.590 align:middle line:84%
and they do not renew
programs easily.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think they
funded them for 20 years.

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah.

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.077 align:middle line:84%
And that's what, honestly,
what caught my attention.

00:22:41.077 --> 00:22:42.430 align:middle line:90%
I was like, 20 years?

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:44.770 align:middle line:84%
I was like, we can't get
our program funded again.

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:46.990 align:middle line:84%
But this got funded
for 20 years.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:50.370 align:middle line:10%
But yeah, so that said to
me that there was something

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:53.220 align:middle line:10%
there because just from
personal experience working

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.090 align:middle line:10%
with the funding
agencies, I'm like,

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:57.680 align:middle line:10%
they don't renew just anything.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And then reading the science
and then speaking to him,

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:02.880 align:middle line:90%
and yeah, he just believed it.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Especially the science,
I just thought,

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:07.470 align:middle line:84%
yes, some of the
older experiments

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:09.160 align:middle line:90%
were methods we wouldn't use.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.830 align:middle line:84%
But then those experiments
had been replicated many times

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:15.910 align:middle line:84%
in modern days in
many different labs.

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:18.680 align:middle line:84%
So it seemed like a
very solid research.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You landed
in a very solid place.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:23.160 align:middle line:90%
Then came Mark Boccuzzi.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:27.850 align:middle line:84%
I was really interested in
mediumship and psychic phenomena

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:30.020 align:middle line:84%
and the difference
between the two.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.860 align:middle line:90%
And he is the one who--

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.650 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to him early on,
and I was so grateful

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:39.073 align:middle line:84%
because he was, like, let me
just give you a reading list.

00:23:39.073 --> 00:23:41.240 align:middle line:84%
He's like, I'm going to
send you a big reading list.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.097 align:middle line:84%
And you can sit and read through
all this and then come back.

00:23:44.097 --> 00:23:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then come
back, grasshopper.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yes, exactly.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.472 align:middle line:90%
That was the tone.

00:23:49.472 --> 00:23:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
big reading list.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.120 align:middle line:90%
But it was very educational.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:54.920 align:middle line:90%
And he's right.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.532 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot
that I didn't know.

00:23:56.532 --> 00:23:58.240 align:middle line:84%
I think he's the one
who actually told me

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.980 align:middle line:84%
that this had been studied
for over 100 years.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And there were so
many experiments.

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
dig into all of it.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
oh, he was right.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:06.890 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot here.

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And my reaction, I was
kind of incredulous

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:16.180 align:middle line:84%
that we, as in scientists,
mainstream science,

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:20.230 align:middle line:84%
were not aware of any
of these experiments.

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:23.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even bother to look
up the research initially

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.030 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't
think it existed.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So when he told me
that, I was like, no.

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:31.170 align:middle line:84%
But then I went and found there
was so much research, so much

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:32.610 align:middle line:84%
research, that
there had been what

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:35.820 align:middle line:84%
we call reviews and
meta-analysis, which

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.810 align:middle line:84%
is when you pull all
the research together,

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:39.630 align:middle line:84%
there's so much that you can
pull it together and look

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:40.210 align:middle line:90%
at it as a whole.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So much proof
for the phenomena.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:41.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:42.840 align:middle line:90%
So they had that.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.793 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, this is crazy.

00:24:44.793 --> 00:24:46.210 align:middle line:84%
How come we don't
know about this?

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Because it really challenges,
not the rest of what

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:53.590 align:middle line:84%
we've done-- a lot of normal
science still stands--

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:57.190 align:middle line:84%
but I think if you're looking
at the intention work,

00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:00.030 align:middle line:84%
it does affect our
scientific method

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:01.480 align:middle line:90%
and how we design experiments.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.210 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I just
started thinking,

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:04.980 align:middle line:90%
this is really important.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.150 align:middle line:90%
And we're not looking at it.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're
not looking at it.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.995 align:middle line:84%
And then you started
meeting with some people

00:25:08.995 --> 00:25:10.985 align:middle line:84%
fairly high up in
the government.

00:25:10.985 --> 00:25:12.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: So yeah,
Hal connected me

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:16.270 align:middle line:84%
with various different
people that he knew.

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.520 align:middle line:90%
And I just spoke to them.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Each person that I spoke to
was another crisis for me.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it opened up
a new can of worms of research,

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:29.880 align:middle line:90%
understanding, experience.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Everything that they
said, every word, every topic, I

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:35.550 align:middle line:90%
had never heard of before.

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:38.890 align:middle line:90%
So it's stuff all over Gaia now.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:40.770 align:middle line:84%
But it's things that I
had never encountered.

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I would just take
notes and sit there wide-eyed

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.260 align:middle line:90%
and just listen.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:48.150 align:middle line:84%
But after every call, I
would sob on the floor

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:50.260 align:middle line:84%
because I was like, I
don't understand anything.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:50.765 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:25:50.765 --> 00:25:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It made you
feel like you knew nothing

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:54.350 align:middle line:84%
in the face of
everything, right?

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:55.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And then, I mean, also, some
of it is just really weird.

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And so you're like, oh, is
reality really this weird?

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:06.790 align:middle line:90%
Or like, what is the truth?

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And if so, it's a
little upsetting

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:14.450 align:middle line:84%
if you're coming
from just mainstream

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:18.590 align:middle line:84%
science and normal
life to, in some ways,

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:20.010 align:middle line:90%
you don't want to know about.

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:23.450 align:middle line:84%
I felt I started to feel like
I wish I didn't know about some

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:24.250 align:middle line:90%
of this stuff.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:25.050 align:middle line:90%
I wish--

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:26.663 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give us
an example of what

00:26:26.663 --> 00:26:28.580 align:middle line:84%
really disturbed you
because you just couldn't

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.325 align:middle line:90%
get your mind around it.

00:26:30.325 --> 00:26:33.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: The
dimensions and, maybe,

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:36.920 align:middle line:84%
beings in other dimensions
and their ability

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.760 align:middle line:84%
to maybe come in and out of
ours, that was upsetting to me.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.150 align:middle line:90%
I wish I didn't know about that.

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:44.025 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's upsetting
to a lot of people

00:26:44.025 --> 00:26:46.820 align:middle line:84%
when they first encountered that
information even if you're not

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.310 align:middle line:90%
a scientist.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:49.782 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah.

00:26:49.782 --> 00:26:51.240 align:middle line:84%
No, it was really
more as a person.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:57.750 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I don't know
that I want to know this.

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:58.650 align:middle line:90%
It was frightening.

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:02.450 align:middle line:84%
But it settled, I
think, initially,

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:04.230 align:middle line:90%
and then you get used to it.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:05.030 align:middle line:90%
And it's settled.

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:06.738 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you
ultimately come across,

00:27:06.738 --> 00:27:08.700 align:middle line:84%
I assume, the concepts
of parallel timelines

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.120 align:middle line:90%
and that time is not linear?

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:10.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.337 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did
that affect you?

00:27:12.337 --> 00:27:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Because that's one that
I think most people still

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.880 align:middle line:84%
grapple with a bit
because it's hard to get

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.680 align:middle line:90%
our linear minds around.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: That one actually
made more sense to me.

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:23.796 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure why.

00:27:23.796 --> 00:27:25.990 align:middle line:90%
And it excited me.

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:27.160 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was exciting.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:32.610 align:middle line:84%
I thought, that's cool if
you can affect the past

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:34.500 align:middle line:90%
from the present or the future.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.530 align:middle line:90%
Or I don't know.

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:36.560 align:middle line:84%
I just thought it
was really exciting.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so that was
more comfortable for you?

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah.

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:42.243 align:middle line:84%
And I think probably because of
the coffee readings with my mom

00:27:42.243 --> 00:27:43.410 align:middle line:90%
because I had already seen--

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:44.175 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You
already experienced.

00:27:44.175 --> 00:27:45.633 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah,
that might be why.

00:27:45.633 --> 00:27:46.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:51.210 align:middle line:84%
So ultimately,
after interviewing

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:55.050 align:middle line:84%
all of these people,
what to you was the most

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:57.960 align:middle line:90%
shocking and powerful--

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.540 align:middle line:84%
and I know it's hard to
answer-- bit of evidence

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:04.120 align:middle line:84%
that you came across that if
you had just 15 seconds to say,

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.910 align:middle line:84%
this thing rocked
your world when

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:08.700 align:middle line:84%
you were doing this research,
what would that have been?

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:14.106 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: I think maybe the
consciousness surviving death.

00:28:14.106 --> 00:28:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Reincarnation?

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:18.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Maybe yes,
which is related to that.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.790 align:middle line:90%
It survives death.

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And then, yeah, that, I
actually believe it now.

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:28.430 align:middle line:84%
I think I believe
that it's possible.

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:33.710 align:middle line:10%
I think that one really shook
me because, as a neuroscientist,

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:37.450 align:middle line:10%
we're taught that the
brain, the physical matter

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:40.430 align:middle line:10%
of the brain, the neurons,
produce consciousness.

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.220 align:middle line:10%
And so if there was no brain,
there would be no consciousness.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:47.420 align:middle line:10%
And this is really driven home.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So when I started
doing this research,

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:54.710 align:middle line:84%
I didn't encounter that
theory until a few months in.

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And when I did, I was
immediately like, no,

00:28:58.540 --> 00:28:59.730 align:middle line:90%
that is not possible.

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, because that
was strictly against everything

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.840 align:middle line:90%
you were taught.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: I was like,
that's just not possible.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.660 align:middle line:84%
But what it took was
me reading philosophy

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:11.690 align:middle line:84%
to understand that there
are other worldviews

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:15.100 align:middle line:84%
and to even understand
that mainstream science's

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:18.910 align:middle line:84%
worldview is scientific
materialism or physicalism.

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:20.540 align:middle line:90%
They don't teach you that.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:23.740 align:middle line:84%
That's an assumption
with-- no one ever tells us

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.280 align:middle line:90%
that what we're working under.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And you never learn that
there's other possibilities,

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:31.340 align:middle line:84%
like panpsychism or
idealism or whatever.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:34.540 align:middle line:84%
So once I learned
that, I would say,

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:39.040 align:middle line:84%
things rapidly turned around
because there was finally

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:45.170 align:middle line:84%
room for an explanation for
all of this that made sense.

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And the consciousness didn't
have to come from the brain

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:49.190 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So that limitation that
I had from my training,

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:54.740 align:middle line:84%
you're just like, oh,
this is my training.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:56.890 align:middle line:84%
It's under scientific
materialism,

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:58.670 align:middle line:90%
but there's other philosophies.

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And so if I just step outside of
that, it's perfectly reasonable.

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then because
the areas of science

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.250 align:middle line:84%
don't speak to each other,
they're not collaborating,

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:09.750 align:middle line:84%
they're not
communicating, and you'd

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:12.720 align:middle line:84%
think neuroscience would
be at the center of a very

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:16.500 align:middle line:84%
vast exploration about
the greater mind.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:17.610 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:18.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: It's not.

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:19.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:19.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:19.840 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Neuroscience, just
like all other science,

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:22.660 align:middle line:90%
is very specialized.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:27.640 align:middle line:84%
We all have our niches
that we stay inside of.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to
be drawing to a close,

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.280 align:middle line:90%
hopefully, pretty soon.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we'll talk
about that in a minute.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.460 align:middle line:84%
But that's one of the things
that bothered you because here

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.450 align:middle line:90%
you had mental illness.

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:42.970 align:middle line:84%
You could talk about a
break from zero point.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And this was something
that really fascinated you.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And as a neuroscientist--
and there were psychologists,

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:49.660 align:middle line:90%
you never spoke to each other.

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:53.200 align:middle line:84%
You never got to look at the
whole situation with the person.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit about that
and what drove you on that path.

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yes.

00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:02.010 align:middle line:84%
So neuroscience takes a
very reductionist view

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:03.280 align:middle line:90%
of mental illness.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And I won't go into
the whole history.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:10.098 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We probably
wouldn't understand it.

00:31:10.098 --> 00:31:10.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah.

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:13.483 align:middle line:84%
So it's very reductionist
and very chemical.

00:31:13.483 --> 00:31:15.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I do think people are
familiar with that, the idea

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:19.110 align:middle line:84%
that depression is a
chemical imbalance.

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:20.920 align:middle line:84%
That has been a narrative
for a long time.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.710 align:middle line:84%
These are all
narrative-based, they're

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:25.470 align:middle line:84%
theories that we come
up with in the field

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:27.745 align:middle line:90%
to explain some behavior.

00:31:27.745 --> 00:31:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there's
some truth in it.

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:32.190 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard about
dopamine and serotonin

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:34.870 align:middle line:84%
and neurotransmitters
and neurochemicals.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:36.497 align:middle line:90%
We've heard these things.

00:31:36.497 --> 00:31:37.955 align:middle line:84%
It's common now to
have heard that.

00:31:37.955 --> 00:31:41.588 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: But well,
first of all, we still

00:31:41.588 --> 00:31:44.130 align:middle line:84%
don't have a good understanding,
actually, of mental illness.

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Because if we did,
we would probably

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:50.200 align:middle line:84%
be better able to create
pharmaceuticals or whatever,

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:53.920 align:middle line:84%
any kind of treatment, whatever
it is that could address this.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.500 align:middle line:84%
But our treatments
for mental illness

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.293 align:middle line:90%
are terrible and lacking.

00:31:57.293 --> 00:32:00.895 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Terrible, basically
put a person in a stupor.

00:32:00.895 --> 00:32:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yes, yeah.

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And the drugs only work, I
think, for 50% of the people,

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:07.910 align:middle line:90%
50% of the time.

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:10.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
always lobotomy.

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:11.845 align:middle line:90%
We do have other tools.

00:32:11.845 --> 00:32:14.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: It did have
its benefits, though.

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:15.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:18.390 align:middle line:84%
So I think, yeah, we never
learned about psychology,

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:22.772 align:middle line:84%
though, and cognitive behavioral
therapy and all of those things.

00:32:22.772 --> 00:32:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Neuroscience never even
touches that, which is crazy,

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:27.950 align:middle line:84%
to think that if you're
a neuroscientist working

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:32.900 align:middle line:84%
on depression, I'm not sure that
you spend a lot of time looking

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:38.300 align:middle line:84%
into behavioral therapies or
how those could maybe even work

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.545 align:middle line:84%
together with the chemical
model that you're using.

00:32:41.545 --> 00:32:44.090 align:middle line:90%


00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:46.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not
aware of, if there

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.850 align:middle line:84%
are very few labs that look at
the overlap and the interplay

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:50.670 align:middle line:90%
between them.

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:53.600 align:middle line:84%
So as a result, we don't have
good models of mental illness.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.156 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
good treatments.

00:32:55.156 --> 00:32:55.956 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:55.956 --> 00:32:57.750 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to ask
you to go out on a limb

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:01.640 align:middle line:84%
because now it seems that the
world is experiencing almost

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.800 align:middle line:90%
an epidemic of mental illness.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's showing up
in a lot of ways.

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:08.060 align:middle line:90%
Kids are being drugged.

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.500 align:middle line:84%
People are living and
sleeping on the streets.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a kind of
cognitive dissonance

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.670 align:middle line:84%
where people are just
floating through life.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:20.180 align:middle line:84%
What, with everything
you've studied,

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.650 align:middle line:84%
on a multi-dimensional
level, do you

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:25.900 align:middle line:84%
consider to be feeding the
state we call mental illness?

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah.

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:32.030 align:middle line:10%
If I were to step back into
my old neuroscience shoes

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:34.380 align:middle line:10%
before all this
stuff happened to me,

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.220 align:middle line:10%
I would despair and be like,
we have no understanding

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:40.260 align:middle line:10%
of mental illness, and we're
nowhere near understanding it.

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:44.760 align:middle line:84%
But after this journey, I
started exploring psychology.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.728 align:middle line:84%
And I started trying all these
different treatment modalities

00:33:47.728 --> 00:33:50.270 align:middle line:84%
that I came across in the books
I was reading, like past life

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:54.740 align:middle line:84%
regression and psychedelics
and emotional freedom technique

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.210 align:middle line:90%
and all these different things.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And I started to see in
myself an improvement

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:04.550 align:middle line:84%
in emotional regulation,
understanding my own emotions,

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:08.290 align:middle line:84%
connecting with myself,
even knowing what I want,

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:09.699 align:middle line:90%
or who I was.

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And I, in that
literature, found models

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:16.909 align:middle line:84%
of what goes wrong when you
lose connection with yourself,

00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:19.480 align:middle line:84%
or when you don't
address your traumas

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.850 align:middle line:84%
or come to be in good
relationship with your emotions.

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:25.469 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, as a
neuroscientist, I

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:27.620 align:middle line:84%
would have scoffed at all
of that and been like,

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:29.460 align:middle line:84%
no, it's chemicals, and
we'll figure it out,

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:30.580 align:middle line:90%
the neurotransmitters.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:36.949 align:middle line:84%
But I personally experienced the
benefit of all of those things,

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:40.659 align:middle line:84%
And they changed
my life drastically

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:44.600 align:middle line:84%
for the better, including
my shift in worldview.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.830 align:middle line:84%
So even flipping the worldview
to think that the universe might

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:51.880 align:middle line:84%
not be meaningless, or that
there's no meaning to life, even

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:55.389 align:middle line:84%
flipping that significantly
improved my quality of life.

00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And to be able
to, perhaps, fold into it

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and, maybe, what's influencing
this person isn't even

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:01.100 align:middle line:90%
from this lifetime.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Right.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe it's
something embedded

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:04.680 align:middle line:90%
in the subconscious somewhere.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.836 align:middle line:84%
And science doesn't even know
how to address the subconscious.

00:35:07.836 --> 00:35:09.805 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yes, it's a lot.

00:35:09.805 --> 00:35:11.680 align:middle line:84%
Neuroscience definitely
doesn't address that.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, they're starting
to with the emergence

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:17.220 align:middle line:90%
of attachment theory.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
popular right now.

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.845 align:middle line:84%
A lot of shorts
on that out there.

00:35:20.845 --> 00:35:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah, we'll see.

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:23.410 align:middle line:90%
But that one is useful.

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And it does connect the
subconscious behavior

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:29.410 align:middle line:84%
to conscious behavior
and how that plays out.

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:34.450 align:middle line:84%
So I would say, that's the
best we've gotten thus far.

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And it might help connect
neuroscience and psychology.

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:42.190 align:middle line:84%
But there has been a lot
lacking in that area.

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think it really is like
a disconnection from ourselves,

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:50.910 align:middle line:84%
from nature, from each other,
from a higher power, all

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:52.407 align:middle line:90%
those things that have caused--

00:35:52.407 --> 00:35:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People spending
so much time alone

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.760 align:middle line:84%
in their siloed
information that it

00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:01.170 align:middle line:84%
is creating a mass cognitive
dissonance and an inability

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:04.830 align:middle line:84%
to even look at another person
that feels differently than you

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:07.325 align:middle line:84%
and understand them
or accept them at all.

00:36:07.325 --> 00:36:08.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Definitely.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That is kind of a
low-grade mental illness where

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:14.050 align:middle line:84%
you can't take
difference anymore.

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:15.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: That's right.

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:16.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:18.427 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can take-- they
can't be uncomfortable.

00:36:18.427 --> 00:36:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They can't
be uncomfortable.

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:23.500 align:middle line:84%
If someone disagrees with you,
your whole body seizes up.

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And now you're in a
mild panic mode what

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.150 align:middle line:90%
to do with this friendship.

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:30.455 align:middle line:90%
We disagreed on something.

00:36:30.455 --> 00:36:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Right now, it seems
that we have been

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:36.476 align:middle line:84%
groomed to have very little
emotional resilience.

00:36:36.476 --> 00:36:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yes, you're right.

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:40.720 align:middle line:90%
I completely agree with that.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:41.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.830 align:middle line:84%
It's like, if something
makes you uncomfortable

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:48.000 align:middle line:84%
or triggers you, you just shut
it down, walk out, walk away

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.080 align:middle line:90%
from it.

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.710 align:middle line:84%
But I learned in a
lot of the research

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:55.040 align:middle line:84%
that I was doing, even though it
started off spiritual and then

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.550 align:middle line:84%
quickly became healing
work and psychological,

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:03.950 align:middle line:84%
that you came here to allegedly
work through this stuff

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:05.010 align:middle line:90%
to feel it all.

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
to really heal is

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:10.440 align:middle line:90%
to feel it and work through it.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:14.240 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, I started doing
that even though it was hard.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.640 align:middle line:84%
I was very avoidant
initially, so

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.390 align:middle line:84%
out of touch with my
emotions, very repressed.

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And part of that is
science because you

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:24.470 align:middle line:84%
have to put on this
persona of being

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:29.310 align:middle line:84%
very hard and serious and
unemotional and objective.

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And that really starts to
solidify, like, you just

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:35.340 align:middle line:90%
become rigid in every way.

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:39.290 align:middle line:84%
So I think after this
journey, I started

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:40.880 align:middle line:90%
trying to lean into that.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.530 align:middle line:84%
If something makes
me uncomfortable,

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:44.920 align:middle line:84%
trying to lean into it and
understand it and address it.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.045 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It takes courage.

00:37:46.045 --> 00:37:46.845 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah.

00:37:46.845 --> 00:37:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I found it
very helpful, personally.

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And in all the
literature I read,

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:53.810 align:middle line:84%
it seems like that's
the best way forward.

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So part
of your mission

00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:00.320 align:middle line:84%
now is to help the
world of science

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.120 align:middle line:84%
and other scientists understand,
we've got to break free,

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.470 align:middle line:90%
we've got to open our minds.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:07.640 align:middle line:84%
We've got to start
seriously researching

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.860 align:middle line:84%
these other modalities
even if it requires

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.750 align:middle line:84%
creating new departments
with new kinds of science

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:16.010 align:middle line:84%
and, also, speaking
to each other

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:18.195 align:middle line:84%
because you've probably
come to understand

00:38:18.195 --> 00:38:20.570 align:middle line:84%
the mind is something far
different than what you thought

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:20.980 align:middle line:90%
it was.

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:21.897 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Absolutely.

00:38:21.897 --> 00:38:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A lot of moving
parts there, permeating

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:25.420 align:middle line:90%
every cell of the body.

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yep, definitely.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:29.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:34.040 align:middle line:84%
So I was thinking,
how could I help,

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.540 align:middle line:84%
because scientists are
really, really busy,

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.720 align:middle line:90%
and we usually don't have time.

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.030 align:middle line:84%
If I'm a neuroscientist,
and I do cognitive work,

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I usually don't even have time
to read something molecular,

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:47.150 align:middle line:84%
much less something
way out there,

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:49.460 align:middle line:90%
like metaphysical or spiritual.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.730 align:middle line:84%
So my collaborator and
I, Allison Paradise,

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:54.950 align:middle line:84%
she's a neuroscientist
too, we thought,

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:57.250 align:middle line:84%
what if we went
to the conference

00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:58.580 align:middle line:90%
that everyone goes to.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:02.450 align:middle line:84%
It's our Annual Society for
Neuroscience Conference.

00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:05.840 align:middle line:84%
It's the biggest in the field
and maybe even in science.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.590 align:middle line:84%
It has 30,000 or 40,000
attendees every year.

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:10.400 align:middle line:84%
So they're already
going to this.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.900 align:middle line:90%
It's for their careers.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:13.160 align:middle line:90%
They're going to be there.

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:18.310 align:middle line:84%
So what if we did a session
there and just created a space?

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:21.055 align:middle line:84%
And we'll call it neuroscience
and spirituality or something

00:39:21.055 --> 00:39:21.855 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:39:21.855 --> 00:39:23.147 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And see who shows up.

00:39:23.147 --> 00:39:24.355 align:middle line:90%
You're probably there with--

00:39:24.355 --> 00:39:26.355 align:middle line:84%
you have your little cups
of coffee on the side,

00:39:26.355 --> 00:39:29.100 align:middle line:84%
thinking two people will show
up, and thousands will show up.

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.580 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't thousands yet.

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:34.670 align:middle line:84%
But I definitely thought,
no one was going to show up.

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:38.420 align:middle line:90%
But we had a room filled.

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:39.950 align:middle line:90%
It was overflowing.

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:42.035 align:middle line:84%
I think it was between
50 to 60 people.

00:39:42.035 --> 00:39:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it
was overflowing.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:44.785 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: But it
was overflowing

00:39:44.785 --> 00:39:46.900 align:middle line:84%
because we got such a
small room because I

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:48.380 align:middle line:90%
didn't think anyone would come.

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:48.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.060 align:middle line:84%
I was like, oh, no
one will come to this.

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:51.020 align:middle line:90%
This will be fine.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:54.920 align:middle line:90%
But it was standing room only.

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:57.560 align:middle line:90%
And they all had questions.

00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:02.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the topics were varied,
from precognitive dreams

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:06.430 align:middle line:84%
to reincarnation to
psychedelics to just God

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:08.210 align:middle line:90%
and religion and science.

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:10.640 align:middle line:90%
And it was really great.

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So it motivated us
to do more of that.

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And because a lot
of them told us,

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:21.490 align:middle line:84%
they were surprised to see it
on the planner, the program

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:23.320 align:middle line:84%
for the conference,
that they never

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.530 align:middle line:84%
see anything about
spirituality or consciousness

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:30.500 align:middle line:84%
at this conference, and that
they wanted to stay in touch,

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:33.350 align:middle line:84%
they wanted a group, they
wanted more references,

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:34.580 align:middle line:90%
so we started all of that.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:37.912 align:middle line:84%
We started a website and
making a list of references.

00:40:37.912 --> 00:40:40.120 align:middle line:84%
We started Google group,
and we send out a newsletter

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:43.030 align:middle line:84%
once a month just to recommend
things for them to read.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:45.670 align:middle line:90%
And then we continue to do this.

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:47.980 align:middle line:90%
So we started it in 2022.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And we've done it
every year since then.

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:52.830 align:middle line:90%
And it's growing.

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And people, it's becoming
more open to the space.

00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Actually, when they
come, they share more.

00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're not as unsure about
themselves and what to say.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:07.390 align:middle line:84%
They're more like, I'm a
molecular neurobiologist,

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:09.900 align:middle line:84%
but I'm also like
a Reiki healer,

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:13.590 align:middle line:84%
or I do neurodevelopmental
neurobiology,

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:16.888 align:middle line:84%
but I also can see
and hear spirits.

00:41:16.888 --> 00:41:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is much more
fabulous thing you've done.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:21.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is the
beginning of the change,

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.720 align:middle line:90%
is the people like you.

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And I know the common
term or the popular term

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:27.340 align:middle line:84%
is to be a disrupter,
but you actually are.

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:29.650 align:middle line:90%
You're bringing in expanded--

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:31.240 align:middle line:90%
it's more expansive.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:34.743 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very happy
that you chose this.

00:41:34.743 --> 00:41:36.160 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you
were born to do it.

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.530 align:middle line:84%
So I have just one
final question.

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And that is, with the
people coming in and some

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:44.710 align:middle line:84%
of the brilliant new,
really young people,

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:48.010 align:middle line:84%
the Gen Z's coming up in this
field, what are you seeing?

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Are you seeing that they're
maybe a little more open or not?

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:52.495 align:middle line:90%
What's going on there?

00:41:52.495 --> 00:41:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah, of course.

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
we always think,

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.512 align:middle line:84%
oh, they're going to
be open to everything.

00:41:56.512 --> 00:41:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah, it varies.

00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:00.810 align:middle line:84%
But I will say, this
year, man, there

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:02.140 align:middle line:90%
was this group that came in.

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:05.230 align:middle line:84%
We were just so in love with
them because they were young.

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:07.230 align:middle line:84%
They were first-year
graduate students.

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And they had brought their
undergraduate research

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.050 align:middle line:90%
assistants with them.

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:13.590 align:middle line:84%
It was a whole lab
that came together.

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And they came late, but
they came with questions.

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I love it.

00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: And they
had read stuff already.

00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And they just had the
most interesting questions

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:25.830 align:middle line:90%
and the most far out.

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:27.370 align:middle line:84%
They had already
made connections.

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:28.953 align:middle line:84%
They were like, what
part of the brain

00:42:28.953 --> 00:42:31.030 align:middle line:84%
is involved with
psychic phenomena?

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:34.513 align:middle line:84%
How is trauma related to being
open to emergent experiences?

00:42:34.513 --> 00:42:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Allison and I were
just looking at them,

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:38.400 align:middle line:90%
like, wow, they've arrived.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:40.623 align:middle line:90%
So it was really exciting.

00:42:40.623 --> 00:42:41.790 align:middle line:90%
I hope we get more of those.

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:42.998 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, you will.

00:42:42.998 --> 00:42:44.190 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely will.

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And so we just have
a minute or two left.

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:50.040 align:middle line:84%
So any final thoughts on where
you think this might be going

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and just how the
experience of understanding

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:55.730 align:middle line:84%
mind in a much
more expansive way

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:58.690 align:middle line:84%
has just shifted your
complete reality?

00:42:58.690 --> 00:42:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah.

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:01.070 align:middle line:10%
So as I mentioned,
for me, it was

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:04.310 align:middle line:10%
philosophy that really
helped me blow open

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:06.750 align:middle line:10%
that prison in my own mind.

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:08.970 align:middle line:10%
So Allison and I are
trying to do that for them.

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And I do think
that's key to making

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:14.820 align:middle line:84%
them see your inside of
a box of your own making,

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:16.200 align:middle line:90%
of your own choice.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.510 align:middle line:10%
Yes, science
operates in that box.

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:22.310 align:middle line:10%
But if we start looking at our
results and our study designs

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:26.000 align:middle line:10%
from other worldviews, it's
just a fun thought exercise

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.480 align:middle line:10%
that we could do for now.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:31.320 align:middle line:84%
But it will loosen your
mind and the constraints.

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to
encourage that because I

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.670 align:middle line:90%
do think that that is pivotal.

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:39.740 align:middle line:84%
I think if they're staying
in the scientific materialist

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:42.278 align:middle line:84%
mindset, it's a little
bit harder to get--

00:43:42.278 --> 00:43:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, absolutely.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: --to make the jump.

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's where we're
focusing our efforts.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, all I
can say is, good on you.

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:52.760 align:middle line:90%
Congratulations.

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:56.155 align:middle line:84%
And the world of science needs
many, many more people like you.

00:43:56.155 --> 00:43:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And you're helping
to foster some

00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:00.440 align:middle line:84%
of these young ones
become clones of you

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:01.710 align:middle line:90%
or their own version of you.

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah, their
own unique selves.

00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
sharing your story with us.

00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And I know it will
help other people who

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.480 align:middle line:84%
have a hard time opening
up to all this here

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.330 align:middle line:84%
that you had to struggle
so much because you

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:14.290 align:middle line:84%
were so boxed in to the world
of education and science.

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Yeah, it's hard.

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:18.190 align:middle line:84%
It's not an easy path,
but it's worth it.

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:19.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Thank
you so much, Mona.

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:20.545 align:middle line:90%
>>SOBHANI: Thank you.

00:44:20.545 --> 00:44:23.758 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: The name of her book
is Proof of Spiritual Phenomena.

00:44:23.758 --> 00:44:25.550 align:middle line:10%
And you can find out
more about Mona's work

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.

00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:36.000 align:middle line:90%
