00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.290 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Jason
Quitt is back with us today.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.748 align:middle line:10%
And today we're
going to be talking

00:00:23.748 --> 00:00:26.220 align:middle line:10%
about a fascinating subject
that is little known,

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:10%
the power of the
Egyptian postures

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.020 align:middle line:10%
that we've seen in
so many depictions.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.759 align:middle line:84%
It's been my understanding
for many years

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.820 align:middle line:84%
that the Egyptians acted on
purpose, at least in the very

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.580 align:middle line:84%
earliest times before the
fall of the civilization.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, some of their
knowledge has been preserved.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Jason, it's so good to
have you back with us.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>> JASON QUITT: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.912 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We just kind of
touched a little bit on that

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:48.830 align:middle line:90%
subject last time as you were--

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I think you were just
releasing your book.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.010 align:middle line:84%
But before we even
go there and talk

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.230 align:middle line:84%
about these
magnificent postures,

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.840 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about you,
your own posture.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Since I saw you, you
have broken your back.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.730 align:middle line:90%
You have completely recovered.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.709 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that for a moment

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and then go into how you ended
up in this incredibly esoteric

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.380 align:middle line:90%
position.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Sure.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.230 align:middle line:10%
Well, almost two years
ago, November 2017, I

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.630 align:middle line:10%
was preparing for
a trip to Japan.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.860 align:middle line:10%
And I was very stressed.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.010 align:middle line:10%
And I wasn't really
present to my body.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.240 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't paying attention.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.410 align:middle line:84%
So I was walking at night
with the lights off.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And I, by accidentally,
fell down the stairs.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh jeez.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Yeah.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.630 align:middle line:90%
I was holding stuff.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't
grab onto anything.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And when I landed at the bottom
of the stairs, I couldn't move.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.250 align:middle line:90%
I knew it was very bad.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.980 align:middle line:84%
But I've broken ribs
before and things.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know that
I had broken my back.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, my wife was
there at the time.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.500 align:middle line:90%
And she told me not to move.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.180 align:middle line:84%
She called the ambulance and
I went in to the hospital.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Originally, they took x-rays
and they said, you're fine.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.300 align:middle line:90%
Go home.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I was home for over
24 hours with a broken back

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.150 align:middle line:84%
walking around
and moving around.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And what
did it feel like?

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: The most
incredible pain.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Any movement would just
put your body into shock.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.790 align:middle line:84%
So not even painkillers at
that time were even helping.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So I woke up one morning and the
doctor called me back and said,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.305 align:middle line:84%
Jason, get back to the
hospital right away.

00:02:35.305 --> 00:02:36.867 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They
misread the X-rays.

00:02:36.867 --> 00:02:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: They misread
had the X-rays.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yikes.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.598 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: Not what I wanted to
hear but it was very obvious

00:02:41.598 --> 00:02:45.050 align:middle line:84%
that something wasn't
right with my body.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And when they examined
the X-rays again,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.220 align:middle line:84%
they said it was a compound
fracture of the T7 vertebrae.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And I also broke the
backbone as well.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.200 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.450 align:middle line:84%
They call this a
three tier break,

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.230 align:middle line:84%
which means that basically
the spinal cord is exposed.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.370 align:middle line:84%
So if I were to,
let's say fall again

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.650 align:middle line:84%
or even twist the wrong
way, I could have died.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh yeah.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.090 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: So this was
extremely serious.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, after
they diagnosed that,

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.910 align:middle line:84%
I was on one of those
flat board stretchers

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.175 align:middle line:84%
for I think about two or
three days before I could even

00:03:23.175 --> 00:03:23.975 align:middle line:90%
go into surgery.

00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:27.050 align:middle line:90%


00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Now I have two
titanium rods from my--

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.150 align:middle line:90%
what is it-- two below.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.870 align:middle line:90%
It's T5 to T9.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.263 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How's
that at the airport?

00:03:41.263 --> 00:03:43.180 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: Well, thankfully,
it doesn't go off.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.850 align:middle line:90%
I can still go through.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:51.540 align:middle line:84%
But I have two titanium rods
and 10 screws down my back.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.290 align:middle line:84%
So it took a lot
for me to even tell

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.470 align:middle line:84%
them to go ahead for the
surgery because I was very, very

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.663 align:middle line:90%
worried.

00:03:59.663 --> 00:04:00.830 align:middle line:90%
You know, could I heal this?

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.320 align:middle line:90%
Will my life be impacted?

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, basically,
I did the surgery

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:14.100 align:middle line:84%
and had a very,
very quick recovery.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.160 align:middle line:84%
I am very, very thankful to
the medical establishment.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, they
really fixed me up.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think trauma-based
medicine is probably

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.750 align:middle line:90%
the best medicine we have.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.790 align:middle line:90%
I agree with that.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.050 align:middle line:90%
It's excellent for trauma.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Exactly.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Just not
chronic diseases.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: That's right.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.460 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.890 align:middle line:84%
So they really helped me
by correcting the spine,

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.440 align:middle line:90%
making me stronger.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.720 align:middle line:84%
But with all the
things that I've

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:84%
learned my whole life, which
we'll get into more soon,

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.880 align:middle line:84%
I put all those things into
practice as well right away.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I have
to tell everybody

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.570 align:middle line:84%
that the most important
thing with healing

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.720 align:middle line:84%
that I've discovered
is it really

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.480 align:middle line:90%
starts with that mindset.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, the moment I got
the diagnosis that my back was

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.820 align:middle line:84%
broken, the only
thought in my mind

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.230 align:middle line:84%
was I'm going to show
everybody how fast I can heal,

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.460 align:middle line:90%
how perfectly I can heal.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.470 align:middle line:84%
That was the only
thought in my mind.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Most people will
think my life is over,

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.950 align:middle line:84%
I'll never walk again, a
lot of depressing thoughts.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.830 align:middle line:90%
With me, it wasn't at all.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.220 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like I had this
new challenge in my life,

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.070 align:middle line:84%
like I had to overcome
something that I

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.600 align:middle line:90%
knew that I could overcome.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.400 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.213 align:middle line:84%
I think it was two
days after surgery--

00:05:37.213 --> 00:05:38.880 align:middle line:84%
you know, I go around
the world teaching

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:84%
qigong and these
Egyptian postures.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.350 align:middle line:84%
It's how to move your body to
connect to healing energies,

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.870 align:middle line:90%
meditative spiritual energies.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.240 align:middle line:84%
But what happens if
you're paralyzed?

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.920 align:middle line:84%
What if you can't
do any postures?

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.280 align:middle line:84%
And this was a very,
very big lesson for me

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.400 align:middle line:90%
that I had to learn.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And what I did in that
hospital bed was breathe.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.990 align:middle line:84%
I did conscious
breathing meditations.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And what I would do is I
would breathe through my nose,

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.500 align:middle line:84%
follow the air with my
mind, bring it right down

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.980 align:middle line:84%
into my belly, the
[NON-ENGLISH] area.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And I would just breathe
like this in the hospital

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.310 align:middle line:90%
constantly.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And it would put me
into a meditative state.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And something
miraculous happened.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.460 align:middle line:84%
I had this spiritual experience
in the hospital where

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I was breathing, just
consciously breathing

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.720 align:middle line:90%
into my stomach.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And I entered an altered
state of consciousness.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:90%
And I saw this--

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.090 align:middle line:84%
it looked like a metal
coil, this spiral.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.250 align:middle line:84%
It was like a
copper metal spiral.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And there was this energetic
field to the right of it.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.580 align:middle line:84%
And as I continued this
breath, with each breath,

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.530 align:middle line:84%
the field actually moved
closer and closer to this coil.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And when it touched
the coil, the coil

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.860 align:middle line:90%
lit up like a heating element.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.140 align:middle line:90%
So it just lit up like fire.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And when that moment
occurred in this vision,

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.030 align:middle line:84%
my entire body lit up with this
fire, this heat that radiated

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.190 align:middle line:90%
through every cell in my body.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.960 align:middle line:90%
And it was extremely powerful.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I could
send this heat to the parts

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.530 align:middle line:90%
of my body that needed to work.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.640 align:middle line:84%
So I focused my mind
right on the fractures

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.280 align:middle line:84%
and where I needed
the healing work.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.885 align:middle line:84%
And when I did this, the pain
actually escalated a lot.

00:07:36.885 --> 00:07:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I'm sure it did.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:42.480 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: And I felt the
muscles started to spasm.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And I felt almost like
movements inside my body

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.660 align:middle line:84%
like the body was like really
calibrating or recorrecting

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.460 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But it
was acute everywhere.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Yes.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was this new
modality I would

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.490 align:middle line:84%
say that I started to use
while I was in the hospital

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.370 align:middle line:84%
when I couldn't
actually use my body.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.280 align:middle line:84%
I could just use my breath and
my mind to do the healing work.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.580 align:middle line:90%


00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.310 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of
embarrassing but it just

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.645 align:middle line:84%
shows you where my mind
was is that every--

00:08:18.645 --> 00:08:19.770 align:middle line:90%
you know, you're paralyzed.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.780 align:middle line:84%
You can't really
move in the bed.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.030 align:middle line:84%
And you have to call
the nurse if you

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.400 align:middle line:90%
have to go to the restroom.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think a couple
days after surgery,

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.760 align:middle line:84%
I just said I'm not bothering
her and I just got up

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.414 align:middle line:84%
and I walked and
used the washroom.

00:08:34.414 --> 00:08:35.789 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Must
have freaked out.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: They were
very upset with me.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.500 align:middle line:90%
My family was upset with me.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was upset
with me because--

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But you knew because
you could almost feel it

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.170 align:middle line:90%
stitching itself back together.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Yes.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:52.930 align:middle line:84%
It's like in my mind,
I knew it was possible

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.770 align:middle line:84%
even though everybody
was yelling at me.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And once they realized
that I can get out of bed

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:04.070 align:middle line:84%
and walk and do
things by myself,

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.670 align:middle line:84%
they had a meeting with all
the surgeons and the doctors.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, if
Jason's are able to do this,

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.610 align:middle line:90%
we can send him home.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And that also made
my family very upset.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And even my father
said please, just

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.700 align:middle line:84%
fake it so you can stay in the
hospital for at least another

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.570 align:middle line:90%
week.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:23.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:24.342 align:middle line:90%
But you wanted out.

00:09:24.342 --> 00:09:25.300 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: I wanted out.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So then how was your
track of healing after you got

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.380 align:middle line:90%
home?

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: It was very fast.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And most people-- well,
first of all, my wife

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.620 align:middle line:90%
did help me a lot with this.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.530 align:middle line:84%
She researches
nutrition a lot so we

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:45.790 align:middle line:84%
knew that to rebuild the body
we had to nutrify myself,

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:48.160 align:middle line:84%
so I was taking
tons of vitamins.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:90%
And I knew that I had to move.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.410 align:middle line:84%
I could not stay
stagnant in the bed.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And also I would
say I'm allergic

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.770 align:middle line:90%
to pharmaceutical painkillers.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.820 align:middle line:84%
I really can't have
them in my body.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:02.620 align:middle line:90%
I have--

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.995 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm
the same with you.

00:10:03.995 --> 00:10:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: --severe reactions.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: The day I went
home from the hospital,

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.510 align:middle line:90%
no more painkillers whatsoever.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:17.210 align:middle line:84%
I did have a
technology from Italy.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.750 align:middle line:90%
It's a machine called SEQEX.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's a pulse
electromagnetic field

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:28.030 align:middle line:84%
device using a science called
ion cyclotron resonance.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is technology that is
used to actually stitch bones

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.330 align:middle line:90%
back together and bring health.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.090 align:middle line:84%
So I was doing very
natural just using

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:43.660 align:middle line:84%
pulse electromagnetic
field, nutrifying the body,

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.360 align:middle line:90%
and doing these meditations.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.850 align:middle line:90%
And I had a goal.

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is also
very, very important

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:55.210 align:middle line:84%
with healing is you really need
to see yourself doing something

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.080 align:middle line:90%
at a specific time.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.870 align:middle line:84%
So I had planned a trip to
go to Japan three months

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.160 align:middle line:90%
after I broke my back.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And I knew in my
mind that I would

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:12.650 align:middle line:84%
be well enough to actually
get on a plane for 13 hours.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's an
aggressive that good goal.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.970 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: But for some reason,
I knew it was possible.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.640 align:middle line:90%
I could see myself doing this.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.470 align:middle line:90%
And I set that as a goal.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:25.850 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:29.780 align:middle line:84%
So literally three months
after breaking my back fully

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.140 align:middle line:84%
with no painkillers and
just doing the breathing

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.720 align:middle line:84%
meditations, a little
qigong because it's

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.650 align:middle line:84%
hard to move after
a broken back,

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:43.820 align:middle line:84%
and doing the pulse
electromagnetic field

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.680 align:middle line:90%
therapies--

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.630 align:middle line:90%
I even took a video.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:55.070 align:middle line:84%
About three months later, I
climbed Mount Takao in Japan.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Good for you.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.930 align:middle line:90%
This is a very impressive story.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.940 align:middle line:90%
This is kind of an aside--

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.150 align:middle line:90%
going tangential on you here.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.920 align:middle line:84%
What is it about Japan that
you were trying to get to?

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: Well, I go there twice
a year to teach these postures,

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.800 align:middle line:90%
to teach qigong.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.920 align:middle line:90%
And I have many students there.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.280 align:middle line:90%
And I love going and teaching.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:24.770 align:middle line:84%
So I knew I had to go to Japan
just to show my students,

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:29.660 align:middle line:84%
to show everybody that even
at my lowest point in life,

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:33.275 align:middle line:84%
that I could stand back
up and continue the work.

00:12:33.275 --> 00:12:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, thank you.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.172 align:middle line:84%
That's actually a really
inspirational story.

00:12:37.172 --> 00:12:39.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure there are people
who've suffered trauma that

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:40.755 align:middle line:84%
are watching this
saying, yeah, I

00:12:40.755 --> 00:12:42.680 align:middle line:90%
wish I'd known that at the time.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Now let's take a
trip back in time,

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.120 align:middle line:84%
back to when you
were younger and back

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.850 align:middle line:84%
to when you started
realizing you

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.290 align:middle line:90%
had this connection with Egypt.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Just tell us the story of
how this body of information

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.570 align:middle line:84%
ultimately ended up flowing
into you and through you.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Sure.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was always
a little different.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:11.480 align:middle line:84%
Growing up, I had these I would
say psychic abilities where

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:15.350 align:middle line:84%
I would be able to, let's
say, recall past lives

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:19.020 align:middle line:84%
or have out of body
experiences as a child.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And this intensified
in my early 20s.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And to tell you
the truth, I really

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:28.260 align:middle line:84%
wasn't interested
in Egypt at all.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea why I was
being called down that road.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:38.430 align:middle line:84%
But when I first started to
leave my body in my early 20s,

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:42.080 align:middle line:84%
the beings that started
to communicate with me

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.700 align:middle line:90%
were focused on healing.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.550 align:middle line:84%
So when I started
to leave my body,

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:51.020 align:middle line:84%
they said to me before I become
who I'm supposed to become,

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:53.120 align:middle line:90%
I need to heal myself.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.840 align:middle line:84%
So the messages were all
about this healing journey.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And when you're getting
messages that you need healing,

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:07.190 align:middle line:84%
you obviously think
that you're sick.

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:10.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Were they looking
more at mental, perceptive,

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:11.090 align:middle line:90%
emotional?

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.340 align:middle line:84%
What kind of feeling
were they referring to?

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: I didn't know at first
so I thought that I was very

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:17.840 align:middle line:90%
sick.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And at the time of my
life, I actually was sick,

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.440 align:middle line:84%
or I perceived
myself to be sick.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.070 align:middle line:84%
I had a condition my
whole life called IBS.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And basically, any
food that I would eat

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:35.300 align:middle line:84%
would make me entirely sick
so I was skin and bones.

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.260 align:middle line:90%
Literally.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Like right now I am about
6' 4", 6' 5" height.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.445 align:middle line:84%
And sitting here today,
I'm about 200 pounds.

00:14:43.445 --> 00:14:46.010 align:middle line:90%


00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.930 align:middle line:84%
In my early 20s, I
was still 6' 4", 6' 5"

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.690 align:middle line:90%
but I was around the 150, 160.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:52.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.110 align:middle line:90%
You were skin and bones.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And with IBS, the food
doesn't digest properly.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.717 align:middle line:84%
It just kind of runs
right through you.

00:14:58.717 --> 00:15:00.800 align:middle line:84%
So you don't absorb the
nutrients and the calories

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.670 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Yes.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.970 align:middle line:84%
So I was basically
a walking skeleton.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.960 align:middle line:90%
I was very sick.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.060 align:middle line:84%
I also had learning
disabilities.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.590 align:middle line:84%
It was very hard for
me to read and write.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And I also stuttered
very badly when I spoke.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.890 align:middle line:84%
So I had these
conditions that I lived

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:22.130 align:middle line:84%
with basically my whole
life that I just considered

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.740 align:middle line:90%
my everyday normal life.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.350 align:middle line:84%
So when these beings started
to communicate with me

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:32.480 align:middle line:84%
and tell me I needed to heal, I
made appointments with doctors

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.190 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what
was wrong with me.

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And basically, all the
tests came back as Jason,

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.500 align:middle line:90%
you're completely healthy.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.360 align:middle line:84%
The reason you're so
skinny and the reason

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:50.220 align:middle line:84%
you have IBS and these issues
is because you're under stress.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.100 align:middle line:90%
So that was the diagnosis.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:57.700 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that maybe
this wasn't the area

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.190 align:middle line:84%
that I was supposed to search
for to find my healing.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:05.470 align:middle line:84%
So when I had the opportunity to
speak with these beings again,

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:10.600 align:middle line:84%
they said to me that I
needed to heal my energy.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And they were telling
me that my energy is

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:23.080 align:middle line:84%
very weak and distorted
and that because of this, I

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.740 align:middle line:90%
will continue to be sick.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And until I strengthen
my energy fields,

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.810 align:middle line:84%
I will continue down this
road which is not a good road.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:35.213 align:middle line:84%
And they actually told
me to learn qigong.

00:16:35.213 --> 00:16:36.880 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the
first things they told

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.880 align:middle line:90%
me to look into was qigong.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And luckily for me,
I had a cousin--

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.185 align:middle line:84%
or I still have a cousin
who teaches qigong.

00:16:46.185 --> 00:16:47.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Cassandra.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.540 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Sandra.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So she was actually
very excited that what

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.120 align:middle line:84%
I was interested in
learning because we

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.960 align:middle line:84%
started to take classes
together almost right away.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.250 align:middle line:84%
But also I was told
about nutrition and food.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And very interestingly,
they said

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.280 align:middle line:84%
that it's not just
the food that's

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.140 align:middle line:90%
the problem here on Earth.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.560 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy that the
food and water accumulates

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.290 align:middle line:84%
before it reaches the
table and you eat it.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:22.450 align:middle line:84%
So they were telling me
that that energy is also

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:26.050 align:middle line:84%
disruptive to our bodies
and that before we

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:29.890 align:middle line:84%
eat it or consume it,
we have to almost--

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:32.950 align:middle line:84%
the best word to describe
it is to pray over

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:35.350 align:middle line:90%
that food and water.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:38.740 align:middle line:84%
They literally told me to
put my hands over the food

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.550 align:middle line:84%
and connect with the energy of
the food until I can feel it.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.760 align:middle line:90%
And it just feels like a bubble.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And once you can feel that
bubble around the food, what

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.100 align:middle line:84%
you do is you take that bubble,
and you thank that energy.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:52.900 align:middle line:90%
You release it.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.810 align:middle line:84%
You literally pull
it out of the food.

00:17:55.810 --> 00:18:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And then you call on pure
energies, purifying energies,

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.290 align:middle line:90%
healing energies.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:03.190 align:middle line:90%
And then you feel it.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.190 align:middle line:84%
It comes into the hands
like another bubble.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.300 align:middle line:90%
And then you place it.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is interesting
because most of the time when

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:10.937 align:middle line:84%
you see people praying
over their food,

00:18:10.937 --> 00:18:11.770 align:middle line:90%
it's just thank you.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.090 align:middle line:84%
You're putting some energy
into it and you're done.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:16.600 align:middle line:84%
So you don't see the process
where you're actually pulling

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.310 align:middle line:90%
out the distorted energies.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Now were they talking
about food that's

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.250 align:middle line:84%
kind of industrial
type of agriculture

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:29.440 align:middle line:84%
or even the most gentle
and careful organic foods?

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: They said try your
best to eat only organic

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:36.430 align:middle line:90%
and drink only the purest water.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:41.180 align:middle line:84%
But even then, they say that
food and water holds memory.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:41.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Ooh.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:42.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.350 align:middle line:90%
This is what's so interesting.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And it just came up in a
conversation the other day

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:51.950 align:middle line:84%
actually that here this
planet is covered with water.

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And we don't stop and think--
when we think of something

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:56.560 align:middle line:84%
like homeopathy
where we can directly

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.040 align:middle line:84%
program fluids
and water to carry

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.250 align:middle line:84%
very specific energetic
information for healing

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.830 align:middle line:84%
and such, we don't
stop and think

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:10.330 align:middle line:84%
all of the bodies of water are
being programmed constantly.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Did they talk to you about this
or show you what this does?

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:14.350 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Yes.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is why they say
it's very important that we

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:22.190 align:middle line:84%
clear that memory and
put new energy into it.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And they were even saying
that, let's say for example you

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.910 align:middle line:84%
go to a restaurant that's an
organic restaurant with very

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:29.050 align:middle line:90%
good food.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:31.590 align:middle line:84%
But what if the chef is
having a really bad day?

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: They're putting
that energy into that food.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you consume
that energy, you

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:42.670 align:middle line:84%
may react emotionally,
mentally, and it may actually

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:43.930 align:middle line:90%
make you sick.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's not actually
contamination of the food.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.863 align:middle line:90%
It's contaminated with energy.

00:19:48.863 --> 00:19:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That makes
total sense to me.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:53.560 align:middle line:84%
For years I wondered why it is
that when I went out to eat,

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.120 align:middle line:84%
I never felt as good as when
I made my own food at home.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, that's weird,
I mean because I love food.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:59.920 align:middle line:90%
I love dining out.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.060 align:middle line:90%
But it never settled as well.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And that makes perfect
sense because you

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.552 align:middle line:84%
have to deal with the
energy load of what's

00:20:05.552 --> 00:20:09.280 align:middle line:84%
going on in that establishment--
the chef, the sous chef,

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.200 align:middle line:84%
the dishwashers, and
everybody else that

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.757 align:middle line:90%
are in there together.

00:20:12.757 --> 00:20:15.340 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: It's like when you're
sick and your grandmother will

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.470 align:middle line:90%
make you a soup.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.820 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
love in that soup

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.080 align:middle line:84%
that is better than any
medicine anybody can give you.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:21.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.860 align:middle line:90%
That intention towards you.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.540 align:middle line:84%
So this brings up
Emoto's work and what

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:28.360 align:middle line:84%
he did with water and the
beautiful crystallization

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.220 align:middle line:84%
patterns he created with high
thoughts, vibrations, and love.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.360 align:middle line:84%
So we're kind of right back
to Masaru Emoto's work as

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.460 align:middle line:90%
having some really deep value.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.490 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Absolutely.

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:38.290 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:42.910 align:middle line:84%
So these beings, they led
me on a path of this healing

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:47.260 align:middle line:84%
journey of discovering of
what's in this world that

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.660 align:middle line:90%
affects our energetic system.

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And they also spoke
about how the air is

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.520 align:middle line:84%
full of radiation,
radio waves, microwaves,

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.220 align:middle line:84%
and that it affects
us over time.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.730 align:middle line:84%
It starts to break down
our energetic systems.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:08.510 align:middle line:84%
So they also said that qigong
and having the proper mineral

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.310 align:middle line:90%
balance--

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:13.520 align:middle line:84%
food in the body will strengthen
our electromagnetic field

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.160 align:middle line:90%
so we become--

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.380 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say immune
to it but we'll

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.680 align:middle line:84%
have a greater
defense energetically

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.250 align:middle line:84%
to the onslaught of energies
in our environment as well.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Did they give you
any specific information about

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:29.230 align:middle line:84%
the type or spectrum
of, for example,

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:32.830 align:middle line:84%
minerals that generally benefits
humanity at this time when

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.930 align:middle line:90%
we're being challenged?

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: They actually showed
me-- it was almost like a harp.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is how
they described it.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:44.350 align:middle line:84%
They showed that each
metal element that makes up

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:47.620 align:middle line:84%
the human body is
a string on a harp

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.530 align:middle line:84%
and that the harp
needs to be very strong

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:52.500 align:middle line:90%
and play a beautiful song.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And they say when you're
deficient in certain elements,

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.350 align:middle line:84%
the string is weakened and
the melody and the harmony

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:01.420 align:middle line:90%
of the body goes all out.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.620 align:middle line:84%
So we actually need
a complete balance

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.840 align:middle line:84%
of minerals in the
right spectrum.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.000 align:middle line:90%
So it's not one or the other.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.210 align:middle line:84%
But as long as we could
have the full spectrum,

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.270 align:middle line:84%
then we can start to even be
strong and channel energies

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:22.170 align:middle line:84%
because think of each
string as, let's say,

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:25.530 align:middle line:84%
a connection to a universal
energy so each element

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:29.160 align:middle line:84%
connects a certain
vibration into your body.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.880 align:middle line:84%
If you are deficient or if you
have too much of that element,

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.053 align:middle line:84%
it's going to cause a
disruption on the entire harp.

00:22:37.053 --> 00:22:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That
makes total sense.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And it brings to mind some
of the more simple complexes.

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.970 align:middle line:84%
Like I think there's
one years ago called

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:48.330 align:middle line:84%
cell food, which is trace
minerals from the sea.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And so is that kind of
what they're talking about,

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:54.050 align:middle line:90%
these nature-based spectrums?

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:54.960 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Yes.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.760 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.270 align:middle line:90%
Seawater.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:00.060 align:middle line:84%
The minerals in there
are very, very important.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we're basically
walking sea water.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:03.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:05.940 align:middle line:84%
So it seems like something
as simple as cell food

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.820 align:middle line:84%
and putting a few drops
in our water each day

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.160 align:middle line:84%
might serve that
because it seems

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.830 align:middle line:84%
like one road we've
gone down is more

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:17.370 align:middle line:84%
is better and just slamming
loads and loads of nutrients

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and vitamins and minerals
without any real guidance

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.680 align:middle line:84%
when, in fact, oftentimes
it is really just

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.500 align:middle line:84%
the most perfect micro
doses in balance that

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.760 align:middle line:90%
seems to do the trick.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's always
finding that balance.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.030 align:middle line:90%
And nature has already found it.

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:30.988 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: That's right.

00:23:30.988 --> 00:23:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you could take
very expensive vitamins.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Your body is going to release
probably 99% of those.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.320 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:43.000 align:middle line:84%
So just a little goes a long way
when it comes to these things.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:43.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.842 align:middle line:90%
Well, thank you for that.

00:23:44.842 --> 00:23:46.660 align:middle line:84%
That's really
useful information.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:49.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's go on to the point
where Egyptians started

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.390 align:middle line:90%
showing up in your dreams.

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: So at this point,
I've been practicing a Chinese

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:57.130 align:middle line:84%
version of qigong
called chi lao.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And I have been practicing
that for many years.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And I started to get very
sensitive where I could feel

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:04.520 align:middle line:90%
the energy in my environment.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.380 align:middle line:84%
I could feel the energy
running through my body.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:11.640 align:middle line:84%
So this was very amazing to me
that I could actually feel it.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:16.560 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing knowing
mentally about energy.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's another thing to
actually experience it and feel

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:22.440 align:middle line:90%
it moving through the body.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.530 align:middle line:84%
I was at a health
show many years ago.

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And there was a booth
that was selling

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:29.720 align:middle line:90%
a product called a shungite.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a Russian stone.

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:33.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a black carbon.

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And at their booth, they had
these statues or pictures

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:42.860 align:middle line:84%
of statues of these
statues holding cylinders.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And the gentleman at the booth
saw that I was interested.

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And he actually handed me
a pair of these cylinders.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And once I put
them in my hand, I

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:56.730 align:middle line:84%
could feel this fire, this
heat, building in my stomach.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that
feeling very well

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:01.670 align:middle line:84%
because that's what I feel
after doing qigong practice

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:04.410 align:middle line:90%
for at least a half an hour.

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:06.480 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that there
was something to this.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:11.170 align:middle line:84%
It was like charging a battery
just holding these cylinders.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:13.660 align:middle line:84%
So I would go home
with these cylinders.

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.120 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what I
was doing by the way.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.140 align:middle line:90%
I was just playing with them.

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And I would just
stand and hold them.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And I would feel the energy
moving through my body.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:27.970 align:middle line:84%
But I would experience
pain in certain locations.

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:29.620 align:middle line:84%
And I know from
different modalities

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:33.640 align:middle line:84%
they say pain is where the
energy hits the blockages.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.700 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that just by
holding these cylinders

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:40.430 align:middle line:84%
it was pushing energy to
places that needed work.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:42.890 align:middle line:84%
So I would actually
stand in my room

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:45.080 align:middle line:90%
and just move the postures--

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.540 align:middle line:84%
move the cylinders
around with my arms

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.660 align:middle line:84%
until I could feel
the pain get worse.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:56.120 align:middle line:84%
When it hit the pain,
I held the posture.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And when I held the posture, I
could feel the energy building

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:00.370 align:middle line:90%
up underneath the pain.

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And it would actually push
the pain out of my body.

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:05.750 align:middle line:84%
And this was a big
eureka moment for me

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:12.130 align:middle line:84%
because it showed me that pain
had this energetic side to it

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and that I could remove pain
from my body using energy.

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:20.110 align:middle line:90%
So I knew I was onto something.

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And this was when
the journey changed.

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I was
having out of body experiences

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.480 align:middle line:90%
traveling to many places.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.030 align:middle line:84%
But this time when
I went to sleep,

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:34.390 align:middle line:84%
I would be projected to
a temple that I can only

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:37.360 align:middle line:90%
describe as in Egypt.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.520 align:middle line:84%
For me, it felt like a
past life remembering

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.540 align:middle line:84%
where I was standing in a temple
with someone that looked just

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:46.250 align:middle line:84%
like the statues,
like a pharaoh.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And they would be standing in
front of me holding a posture.

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:53.150 align:middle line:90%
They never spoke to me.

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.730 align:middle line:84%
All they did was they just
stood there in a posture.

00:26:55.730 --> 00:27:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I just had to
copy whatever they're doing.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.765 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

00:27:01.765 --> 00:27:03.140 align:middle line:84%
So I just stood
in front of them.

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.020 align:middle line:84%
I copied the posture that
they were showing me.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And when I would copy them, it
felt like this thing would just

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.130 align:middle line:90%
open up above my head.

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And it would feel like
a waterfall, but not

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.870 align:middle line:90%
a waterfall like water.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:20.350 align:middle line:90%
It would feel like--

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:22.990 align:middle line:84%
can only describe
it as like photons,

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:26.500 align:middle line:84%
just these little
packets of heat

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.650 align:middle line:84%
running through the
body very, very fast.

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:31.780 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
powerful experience.

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And my physical body
would actually vibrate.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And when I would
wake up in my bed,

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:42.190 align:middle line:84%
I would actually still
be holding the posture

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:46.870 align:middle line:84%
from the journey still vibrating
with this energy flow coming

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:48.130 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And when I would
break the posture,

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.830 align:middle line:84%
the energy would just shut
off so I knew that this

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:56.150 align:middle line:90%
was something very unique.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:57.680 align:middle line:84%
I've never experienced
this before.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.838 align:middle line:84%
I've never felt anything
like this before.

00:27:59.838 --> 00:28:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you
were being taught.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: And I
was being taught.

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:06.100 align:middle line:84%
So I would start to
practice these postures that

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:07.420 align:middle line:90%
were being shown to me.

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.070 align:middle line:90%
I would record them.

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think everybody
has an Egyptian book

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.770 align:middle line:90%
at home somewhere.

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And I went to an Egyptian
book I had downstairs

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:20.140 align:middle line:84%
and I started flipping
through the pictures.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.950 align:middle line:90%
And I saw these statues.

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:22.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:23.930 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:26.500 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: And they're holding
the same postures that are

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.250 align:middle line:90%
being shown to me.

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was just this
light bulb moment

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:38.440 align:middle line:84%
was that these statues were
some type of modality of energy

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.480 align:middle line:90%
that was very ancient.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of went on a path
of I went to the libraries.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:47.740 align:middle line:84%
I took out all these
Egyptian books.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.290 align:middle line:84%
I was just flipping through
them and scanning any statue

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:55.480 align:middle line:84%
that I found and just compiling
all these different postures.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And once I had
enough information

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:02.380 align:middle line:84%
from what was being taught
to me in these out of body

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.380 align:middle line:84%
experiences and what I
found in the library,

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:09.890 align:middle line:84%
I took it to Sandra, which is
my cousin who teaches qigong.

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:15.670 align:middle line:10%
>> QUITT: But she's also an
incredibly intuitive channeler,

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:16.780 align:middle line:10%
to my advantage.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:17.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:18.423 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: That was really good.

00:29:18.423 --> 00:29:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And I showed her
all these things.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And she started
to channel for me.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And she was actually
saying, OK, this posture

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:26.710 align:middle line:90%
has to go with this posture.

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:28.030 align:middle line:90%
And it has to go in this order.

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:29.590 align:middle line:90%
And this posture means this.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And when you do
this posture, this

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.610 align:middle line:90%
is what happens to the body.

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:38.920 align:middle line:84%
So we started to actually
compile and bring back

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:44.170 align:middle line:84%
all this information of
what are these postures.

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And as we started to
do this, we started

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:51.880 align:middle line:84%
to have past life rememberings
as well that we were actually

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.790 align:middle line:84%
connected to each
other back in Egypt

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:58.900 align:middle line:84%
where we were brother
and sisters in that life.

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And we actually
taught this before.

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like we have
this cellular knowledge that

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.600 align:middle line:90%
stays with us from past lives.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: As you're talking,
I'm having flashbacks.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.270 align:middle line:90%
I was in Israel.

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:13.340 align:middle line:90%
And I was in Ankara.

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm at the Cave of
John the Baptist

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:16.933 align:middle line:90%
where he was supposed to--

00:30:16.933 --> 00:30:19.100 align:middle line:84%
it's the cave they now have
a monastery around where

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:21.545 align:middle line:84%
he was said to have done his
visioning out in the wild

00:30:21.545 --> 00:30:22.670 align:middle line:90%
because it's kind of hilly.

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's outside of
Jerusalem and all that.

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:25.940 align:middle line:90%
I love caves.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:26.750 align:middle line:90%
Went in.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:29.090 align:middle line:90%
And I went in--

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and there was no
one around at all,

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.720 align:middle line:90%
which was weird to begin with--

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.030 align:middle line:84%
and sat down on this
teeny little stool.

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:36.870 align:middle line:90%
And then everything started.

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:41.210 align:middle line:84%
I closed my eyes and a being
sunk down from the ceiling.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:45.050 align:middle line:84%
I started being-- well,
what happened was suddenly

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:47.650 align:middle line:90%
my mind was almost co-opted.

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:49.490 align:middle line:90%
And it was showing me this.

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:54.200 align:middle line:84%
It was very, very fast
like a reel of film

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.740 align:middle line:84%
in frames showing me
all the hand postures.

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I intuitively
knew what they all meant.

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was downloaded
into my aura.

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:05.430 align:middle line:90%
But that was it.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I never understood
it beyond that.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And I never really went
back and visited it.

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And so as you're
talking about this now,

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:12.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking,
well, that would be

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:14.750 align:middle line:90%
quite an interesting journey.

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:15.860 align:middle line:90%
It's in my aura.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.570 align:middle line:90%
It's been downloaded there.

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was showing the
meaning behind this.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:23.630 align:middle line:84%
But it was mostly focusing on
the upper body and the hand

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:25.270 align:middle line:90%
gestures.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Yeah.

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
statues not just from Egypt

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.220 align:middle line:84%
but from all over
the world, you'll

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:35.210 align:middle line:84%
see them in various
hand postures, mudras.

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And these are all, I would
say, methods of a lost art,

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.933 align:middle line:84%
of connecting to energy
through the body.

00:31:42.933 --> 00:31:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And was it Sandra that told
you or did the beings that

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:51.050 align:middle line:84%
visited you tell you that
these particular postures were

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:51.950 align:middle line:90%
beyond ancient?

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:54.560 align:middle line:84%
They had been brought initially
from another star system,

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.320 align:middle line:84%
from the Pleiades, and
then certainly used

00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.360 align:middle line:84%
through Atlantean times and
then into Egyptian times

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.160 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Yeah.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:02.570 align:middle line:90%
It was an incredible story.

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And this was a channeling
done by Sandra.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And basically what she said
is that the high priests

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:13.710 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis knew for
hundreds of years

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:18.350 align:middle line:84%
even that there was a
fall coming to Atlantis.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And they had open communication
with a group of beings

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.780 align:middle line:90%
known as the Pleiadians.

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And you know, if you've
watched "Ancient Aliens,"

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:32.210 align:middle line:84%
you think, hey, there's a
spaceship landing on the Earth.

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:34.190 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't what happened.

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:38.030 align:middle line:84%
These priests were connected
through a means of telepathy

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:40.580 align:middle line:90%
and channeling to these beings.

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And it was decided that they
would try this new experiment,

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:51.560 align:middle line:84%
which is let's give or let's
create a set of postures that

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.980 align:middle line:84%
will transform the
electromagnetic fields

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:59.090 align:middle line:84%
of mankind because what they
believed was that if we can

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:02.360 align:middle line:84%
alter and change our
electromagnetic fields,

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.225 align:middle line:84%
we would alter and
change our consciousness.

00:33:05.225 --> 00:33:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And by altering/changing
our consciousness,

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:09.980 align:middle line:84%
we could actually
shift the timelines

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.380 align:middle line:90%
and not go through that fall.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:17.180 align:middle line:84%
So this is the philosophy of
why these postures have been

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.850 align:middle line:90%
channeled to the Atlanteans.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:23.173 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, they did
go through the fall.

00:33:23.173 --> 00:33:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They did and
through natural catastrophe.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding, and
it's written elsewhere as

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:29.930 align:middle line:84%
well, certainly in
the Hermetics as well,

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:33.560 align:middle line:84%
that there were three stages
of loss of that continent

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:37.752 align:middle line:84%
from the top, sinking, destroyed
and each in a different way.

00:33:37.752 --> 00:33:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think many of us
were there at that time.

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:40.740 align:middle line:90%
I was.

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And I have remembrances
of the fall

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:44.390 align:middle line:84%
during the middle
part that chunked off

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.230 align:middle line:90%
and everything kind of fried.

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And so that's deep trauma within
our beings that is still held.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:51.320 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Yes.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they said that the
world we live in today we

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:59.450 align:middle line:84%
can say is a mirror image
of the end of Atlantis

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:02.175 align:middle line:84%
and they're saying many
souls have incarnated now--

00:34:02.175 --> 00:34:03.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very many.

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:03.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:06.170 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
watching this included.

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:07.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: --to go through a
type of healing so that we

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:16.520 align:middle line:84%
don't have to carry those
energies forward so we can heal

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.620 align:middle line:90%
the past from Atlantis.

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And they said that the
postures and these philosophies

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.179 align:middle line:84%
were so important to
the record keepers

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:28.219 align:middle line:84%
that it was actually
brought through

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:30.949 align:middle line:90%
into Egypt after the fall.

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that's what
my intuitive guides have said

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:37.790 align:middle line:84%
for many, many years is to pay
very close attention to what is

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:40.880 align:middle line:84%
preserved through the
Egyptian texts of all kinds,

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.030 align:middle line:84%
whether it's pictographs, and
hieroglyphics, and so forth,

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:48.020 align:middle line:84%
because they laid these down
with intention to be used

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.960 align:middle line:84%
through the ages and
to be rediscovered,

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:54.350 align:middle line:84%
which you are among
those who've done this.

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: And the most important
things that need to stay with

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:00.830 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness are
recorded in stone.

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:01.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:02.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:06.302 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: And if you look
at the statues from Egypt,

00:35:06.302 --> 00:35:08.010 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are
doing all the postures,

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:11.280 align:middle line:84%
the ones that are
holding sacred objects,

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.890 align:middle line:84%
they are cut out of
very hard stone granite

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That can survive
many thousands of years.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.160 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: The only people that
can carve them had to be high

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.540 align:middle line:90%
priests.

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:25.260 align:middle line:84%
They can never be altered so
you can see a statue that's

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:29.920 align:middle line:84%
1,000 years older than another
statue but they're identical.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So the statues
cannot be altered.

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And then in later
periods when knowledge

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:40.370 align:middle line:84%
was going to be destroyed
by other cultures--

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:42.800 align:middle line:84%
you could see this in all the
museums around the world--

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.280 align:middle line:90%
they would chisel the faces off.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: They wou8ld chisel
the hands and the feet off.

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:51.240 align:middle line:84%
So it was to hide
the meanings or what

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.130 align:middle line:84%
are they holding,
where are they looking,

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:56.520 align:middle line:90%
what is their feet posture.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:00.110 align:middle line:90%
So there has been a lot of loss.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:04.140 align:middle line:84%
But I am under the impression
that nothing in this world

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.640 align:middle line:90%
could ever be lost.

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree with you.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:08.340 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: It's always here.

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:12.240 align:middle line:84%
So you hear stories
now of people in Iraq

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.735 align:middle line:90%
destroying archaeological sites.

00:36:13.735 --> 00:36:14.535 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh god.

00:36:14.535 --> 00:36:15.630 align:middle line:90%
The city of Ur.

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:16.430 align:middle line:90%
Terrible.

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: And you know,
it hurts to see this.

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:25.870 align:middle line:84%
But what they don't understand
is that these memories

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:27.490 align:middle line:90%
are encoded with mankind.

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And there is nothing that
can erase those memories.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.298 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: And there will always
be individuals like myself,

00:36:33.298 --> 00:36:37.600 align:middle line:84%
like you, like others that will
have this memory and bring it

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.100 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And I believe this
is what's happened

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:42.543 align:middle line:90%
with the Egyptian postures.

00:36:42.543 --> 00:36:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I believe
you're right.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.720 align:middle line:84%
So we start with the
concept that, first of all,

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:50.470 align:middle line:84%
these were left to be able
to raise our vibrations

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:54.970 align:middle line:84%
and also with the notion that
we as human beings and bodies

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:57.950 align:middle line:84%
are living live
antenna for energy.

00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:58.750 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:00.167 align:middle line:84%
So let's go ahead
and begin there.

00:37:00.167 --> 00:37:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to start
showing some of these postures.

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And you can explain what
they're meant to do.

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Sure.

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:09.610 align:middle line:84%
So our bodies are
literal antennas.

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And what's beautiful about
the planet we live on

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:16.180 align:middle line:84%
is we're bathed in
electromagnetic radiation.

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:19.780 align:middle line:84%
We have the ions coming in
from the ionosphere in the sun.

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth I would say
is a negative polarity.

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:25.340 align:middle line:90%
It pulls us down.

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:28.240 align:middle line:84%
It pulls energy down
towards the earth.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.330 align:middle line:84%
So we have two feet
flat on the earth.

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And it has this pulling
effect, this negative polarity.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Our arms and our hands, when
we stick them up into the air,

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:46.740 align:middle line:84%
we're entering into a mostly
positive ionized atmosphere.

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And when you have the
combination of the pulling,

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.980 align:middle line:84%
the negative polarity
pulling through the feet,

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.810 align:middle line:84%
and the hands in the
air and the atmosphere,

00:37:55.810 --> 00:38:00.560 align:middle line:84%
you are creating this
energetic flow, this almost

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:04.340 align:middle line:84%
like transistor of energy
running through the body that

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:10.980 align:middle line:84%
creates almost like a cell, a
battery of electric life force.

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:14.300 align:middle line:84%
So we are also
oscillating frequencies.

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Our minds, what we
think, our emotions,

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:21.740 align:middle line:84%
the wounds that we carry are
vibrational patterns that

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:25.630 align:middle line:90%
are sent into our environment.

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:28.380 align:middle line:84%
So what we carry
actually creates

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.700 align:middle line:84%
an electromagnetic
field around us.

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And that electromagnetic field
around us creates our reality.

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:38.070 align:middle line:84%
It brings things to us that
we're basically calling out

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:39.820 align:middle line:90%
into the environment.

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:42.750 align:middle line:84%
So if we have a lot
of wounded energies,

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:45.330 align:middle line:84%
we may be calling in those
frequencies and vibrations

00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:48.750 align:middle line:84%
into our lives, whereas if
we have a healed and strong

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:53.550 align:middle line:84%
vibration, we may be calling in
those energies into our lives.

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So what I was taught
was that the way energy

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:02.510 align:middle line:84%
moves through the body is
actually very determined

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:06.440 align:middle line:84%
on not only the mind and the
emotions, the state of being,

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:10.350 align:middle line:84%
but the geometry of
the physical form.

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
standing in a posture,

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:17.300 align:middle line:84%
we have very sacred geometry
running through our bodies.

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:21.590 align:middle line:84%
We are the microcosm of the
macrocosm, so above, so below.

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And when we change
our posture, we

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:29.120 align:middle line:84%
change the way energy
moves through our body.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And if we stand in a posture
and hold that posture,

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:35.210 align:middle line:84%
we're actually
creating a frequency.

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And we're generating an
electromagnetic field

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:40.980 align:middle line:84%
around the body in
that frequency range.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:45.150 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very, very ancient
science of the physical form.

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And if we knew the step
one, step two, step three,

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:53.540 align:middle line:84%
if we knew the code
or the song of which

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:56.720 align:middle line:84%
postures to stand
in which order,

00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:00.440 align:middle line:84%
we can actually create
new electromagnetic fields

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.620 align:middle line:84%
around our body with
specific intent.

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:09.500 align:middle line:84%
So we're really taking our
energies back into our hands

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:14.500 align:middle line:84%
and setting up our energy
fields to perform certain tasks.

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:16.500 align:middle line:90%
So you know, this is a--

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very powerful.

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:19.168 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: It's a
very deep science.

00:40:19.168 --> 00:40:20.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And I can't tell
people what it's

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:27.770 align:middle line:84%
going to do for them, because
every single person is

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:28.570 align:middle line:90%
different.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And every single person carries
a unique energy signature.

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So when a person
practices it, they

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:38.330 align:middle line:84%
may not get the
same result as me.

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:41.030 align:middle line:84%
But they're going to get their
unique results because they

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:43.518 align:middle line:84%
are shifting, and
changing, and rebuilding

00:40:43.518 --> 00:40:44.810 align:middle line:90%
their own electronic structure.

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And that particular
geometric pattern

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:50.488 align:middle line:84%
may be reinforcing something
completely different in them--

00:40:50.488 --> 00:40:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: That's correct.

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --or you
or someone else.

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:53.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:54.620 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, shall we dive into
some of the postures

00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:01.070 align:middle line:84%
that you were shown and
that you use in your book?

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:02.570 align:middle line:90%
Also displays.

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:06.050 align:middle line:84%
So the first one I think
we're going to go to is--

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:07.240 align:middle line:90%
let's see here.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:11.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the left foot of Ra is
the one I have written down.

00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And also this is to bring us in
alignment with earth energies

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:16.810 align:middle line:90%
and cosmic energies as well.

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:17.668 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:41:17.668 --> 00:41:18.710 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: That's correct.

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:19.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.950 align:middle line:84%
The way that I was taught
the left foot of Ra

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:24.930 align:middle line:84%
is that we have two
polarities in the body.

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And when we put the
left foot forward,

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:30.000 align:middle line:90%
we enter into receiving mode.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:30.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Left foot forward,
receiving mode.

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:33.410 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look at this.

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:34.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:36.080 align:middle line:84%
We have a little
video clip on them.

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.190 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:40.490 align:middle line:10%
Repeatedly, when
we look at these,

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:43.150 align:middle line:10%
I think the average person
looking at it when we're

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:45.300 align:middle line:10%
passing through a museum
says, oh, they got them

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:46.300 align:middle line:10%
while they were walking.

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.950 align:middle line:90%


00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:51.045 align:middle line:84%
And you know,
clearly, especially

00:41:51.045 --> 00:41:53.170 align:middle line:84%
considering the Egyptians
doing things for purpose.

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And you see here their hands
in this case are straight.

00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:57.880 align:middle line:90%
Their arms are straight down.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.820 align:middle line:90%
And their fists are closed.

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:01.750 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And so tell us about the
fist closed left foot forward

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:08.450 align:middle line:84%
versus right angle arms which
you show in the posture.

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Sure.

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.528 align:middle line:84%
But you also notice
in the statues

00:42:11.528 --> 00:42:12.820 align:middle line:90%
that they're not wearing shoes.

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:13.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:14.533 align:middle line:90%
Of course, they're barefoot.

00:42:14.533 --> 00:42:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>> QUITT: And most
of the statues,

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:19.230 align:middle line:84%
they're barely wearing
any clothing as well.

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:22.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not because they
couldn't wear these things.

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:26.200 align:middle line:84%
It's because they wanted
their feet touching the earth

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.990 align:middle line:90%
on sands or on granite.

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's because granite is high
in quartz, it's piezoelectric,

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:35.740 align:middle line:84%
they're getting that ionization,
that real strong pull

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:37.210 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Also, they wanted the
sun to touch their skin.

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:45.070 align:middle line:84%
The ions of the
sun, the photons,

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:46.630 align:middle line:90%
was nurturing and feeding them.

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.760 align:middle line:90%
So they were charging.

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you see their hands
close, if you look carefully,

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:53.760 align:middle line:90%
they're holding these objects.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And these objects, I would say,
they're resonant of the earth

00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:01.930 align:middle line:84%
so they're actually really
connecting their energies

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:03.430 align:middle line:90%
to the earth energies.

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:06.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's causing this charge.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
them, really they're

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:12.310 align:middle line:84%
showing you that the
human body is a battery.

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're taking this
energy in for vitality,

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:20.303 align:middle line:84%
for health, and also
for spiritual purposes.

00:43:20.303 --> 00:43:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's look
at the notion of receiving.

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Yes.

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:24.330 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Yeah.

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:26.950 align:middle line:84%
So when the left foot
forward is in receiving mode,

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:30.070 align:middle line:84%
it's activating the right
hemispheres of the brain.

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:33.460 align:middle line:84%
It's actually connecting
you to your environment,

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:34.872 align:middle line:90%
which is very, very important.

00:43:34.872 --> 00:43:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So what you're doing is you're
opening up your whole energy

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:41.710 align:middle line:84%
system just by putting
your left foot forward.

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:46.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Isn't it amazing how
really simple it all is but how

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:48.120 align:middle line:90%
incredibly profound it is?

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Yeah.

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And one of the biggest
rules is healing

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:55.070 align:middle line:90%
is supposed to be simple.

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:56.600 align:middle line:90%
We're built to heal.

00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.300 align:middle line:84%
We have an immune system
that heals all the time.

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:03.920 align:middle line:84%
So why should healing
be complicated?

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:07.970 align:middle line:84%
This is the way we're built.
It's not some out of this world

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:12.200 align:middle line:84%
crazy hard posture you need
to get into to receive energy.

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.230 align:middle line:84%
You receive energy all the time
just by putting your left foot

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:16.180 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:18.960 align:middle line:90%
And step the right foot forward.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:19.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.370 align:middle line:90%
Just a little pun there.

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed too even when
holding stones, or crystals,

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:29.480 align:middle line:84%
or objects that for me the
receiving hand is always

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.470 align:middle line:90%
the left hand.

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Yes.

00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:34.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And information
flows from the left hand.

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And then the projecting
hand is the right hand.

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Yes.

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And they actually say you
have more nerve endings

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:42.620 align:middle line:84%
in the left side of
your body because that

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:45.560 align:middle line:84%
is the flow or the
natural flow that energy

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:48.010 align:middle line:84%
enters in through the left
and out through the right.

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:49.790 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like
an energy breath.

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:51.200 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Yes.

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.000 align:middle line:90%

to is the Salute to the Sun.

a look at that and tell us

00:45:01.545 --> 00:45:03.790 align:middle line:84%

It just clicked again.

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:41.710 align:middle line:84%
That's something that our
own guide showed us ages ago.

00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:43.160 align:middle line:90%
Very, very similar.

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that sequence.

00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:47.560 align:middle line:84%
First of all, most people
think, oh, Sun Salutation.

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And they're thinking
of yoga, of course.

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:50.840 align:middle line:90%
This is different.

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:53.770 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the postures
and the simplicity going

through it again with the
hands palms up to the side

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Sure.

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Salute to the Sun
posture which you just saw

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:05.320 align:middle line:84%
is actually a pose
that's in artwork

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.070 align:middle line:90%
found all over the world.

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:09.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not just Egypt.

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a very popular posture.

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And what they're saying is that
when you hold this posture,

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:18.520 align:middle line:84%
the Salute to the Sun posture
with your hands up facing

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:23.410 align:middle line:84%
the sky, again what you're doing
is you're pulling down that--

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:26.740 align:middle line:84%
we'll call it higher energy,
the energy in the atmosphere.

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:30.130 align:middle line:84%
You're pulling the polarity
of the sky or the heavens

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:31.420 align:middle line:90%
into the body.

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And you're actually pulling
energies up from the earth

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:34.960 align:middle line:90%
through the body.

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And the combination of
those two polarities,

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:40.930 align:middle line:84%
they connect in the
[NON-ENGLISH] in the stomach

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:42.190 align:middle line:90%
area.

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to purify
the energies of the body.

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:49.660 align:middle line:84%
So it's like you're mixing
the two polarities--

00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:52.570 align:middle line:84%
the two highest polarities
of the earth and the sky.

00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:55.600 align:middle line:84%
You're bringing them
within, internalizing them,

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:57.160 align:middle line:90%
transforming that energy.

00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And then it starts to flow
through the whole body

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:01.770 align:middle line:90%
to purify you.

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And so OK.

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:05.090 align:middle line:84%
So you have your
hands like this.

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:10.095 align:middle line:84%
But then they come
together and then down.

00:47:10.095 --> 00:47:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that
part of the sequence.

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>> QUITT: Sure.

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:16.540 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing is you're
seeing the conclusion there.

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:18.700 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing is
we're bringing the hands

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.273 align:middle line:90%
up to a prayer posture.

00:47:20.273 --> 00:47:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And then we're actually
taking the hands

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:25.270 align:middle line:84%
and we're opening
it above the head.

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And what we're doing is we're
holding the disk of the sun.

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Now the disk of the sun is a
concept of the higher chakra.

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:34.690 align:middle line:84%
So there is a chakra
above our heads.

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:37.220 align:middle line:90%
We call it the disk of the sun.

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of our most
powerful chakras of the body.

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:44.770 align:middle line:84%
It connects to the celestial
forces, the fire energy,

00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:46.990 align:middle line:90%
the higher self-consciousness.

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:49.120 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
opening your hands

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:51.010 align:middle line:84%
to hold the disk
of the sun, you're

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:54.100 align:middle line:84%
channeling and bringing down
that fire, that consciousness,

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.550 align:middle line:84%
through the body, which again
has a purifying awakening

00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:59.470 align:middle line:90%
effect to the body.

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:02.320 align:middle line:84%
So as we're like this
and we're holding it,

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.910 align:middle line:84%
at the conclusion
there we're actually

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:07.630 align:middle line:84%
saying a mantra in our
minds or we can actually

00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:09.300 align:middle line:90%
say the mantra out loud.

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:13.810 align:middle line:90%
And the mantra is called Ra ha.

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And the message I
got with Ra ha is

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:21.640 align:middle line:84%
that this mantra organizes
the energies of the body

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:23.530 align:middle line:84%
and places you in
fields of protection

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:28.160 align:middle line:84%
to hold this new energy that's
been channeled into the body.

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And then what we do is
we take that energy,

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:34.240 align:middle line:84%
the Ra ha, and we put
it into prayer posture,

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.240 align:middle line:84%
basically sealing
that frequency,

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.220 align:middle line:84%
bringing-- as we
bring that down, we're

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:40.600 align:middle line:90%
bringing the channel.

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.150 align:middle line:84%
There's a channel of
energy that runs down

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:44.620 align:middle line:90%
through the center of the body.

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:47.500 align:middle line:84%
We're bringing that energy
down the channel of the body

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:51.800 align:middle line:84%
to the heart, which is the
center of our universe.

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:55.360 align:middle line:84%
It's also the connecting
to the universe.

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And then what we do is we
close our hands in a fist

00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:01.210 align:middle line:84%
and place it over the
heart, which seals.

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:06.400 align:middle line:84%
So this is a sealing posture
that seals the energies

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.345 align:middle line:90%
into the heart.

00:49:07.345 --> 00:49:09.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Does it matter
which hand is over?

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: It does not
matter which hand is over.

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And the way that I was shown is
that you just close your eyes

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:17.260 align:middle line:90%
and do it naturally.

00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And whatever hand goes
first for you, that's it.

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:21.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:23.320 align:middle line:90%
And I noticed that for myself.

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.930 align:middle line:84%
If I'm out there in the
morning and looking at the sun

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:27.820 align:middle line:84%
as it comes over
the horizon, that

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:32.260 align:middle line:84%
is just a spontaneous thing that
happens to have the hands open,

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and almost like a big
stretch over the head,

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:39.700 align:middle line:90%
and bring that energy down.

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:42.010 align:middle line:84%
I think people all over the
world just spontaneously,

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:43.300 align:middle line:90%
naturally do this.

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Have you
ever seen a blue heron

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:50.210 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the day with
its wings opened at the sun

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:51.010 align:middle line:90%
to warm up?

00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:52.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: You'll see birds--

00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:56.200 align:middle line:84%
many birds, actually,
doing this, just

00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:59.500 align:middle line:84%
standing there at the sun
with their wings open.

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:02.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we can begin
to charge ourselves.

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And everyone can feel the
freedom, and the power,

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.720 align:middle line:84%
and then allowing the energies
of the cosmos and the sun

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:11.270 align:middle line:84%
to hit the hands and to
bring it into the body.

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yes.

00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And what is the symbol
of ka in ancient Egypt?

00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:19.720 align:middle line:84%
The symbol of ka-- ka
means energy, life force.

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And the symbol of ka is actually
the two hands up to the sky

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:26.500 align:middle line:90%

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And anybody
at home can try this.

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:30.820 align:middle line:90%
We're built for this.

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:32.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not an exercise.

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:36.580 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do is when we
put our hands up in the air,

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:38.920 align:middle line:90%
we start to receive that energy.

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.143 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:50:40.143 --> 00:50:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And I would find
through the years

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:43.930 align:middle line:84%
when I was going into a
really deep meditation,

00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:48.340 align:middle line:84%
that my hands were almost
acting independently for me.

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Where I was really
going into the zone,

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:53.020 align:middle line:84%
I would find that my
hands would come up.

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And even when I'd
come out of it,

00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:56.362 align:middle line:84%
they might still be
in this position.

00:50:56.362 --> 00:50:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And they would be
in this position.

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:00.700 align:middle line:84%

00:51:16.477 --> 00:51:18.730 align:middle line:90%
changed to get the channel.

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:21.070 align:middle line:84%
it's exactly the same
as the human body.

>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's how I've
personally experienced it

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:27.370 align:middle line:84%
through the years, just this
little subtle tweaking, a hand

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:28.845 align:middle line:90%
going lower, coming back up.

00:51:28.845 --> 00:51:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking, what are
my hands doing while I'm

00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:32.940 align:middle line:90%
looking at this stuff?

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:34.440 align:middle line:84%
But they're bringing
that energy in.

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:35.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And this
is what I used to do

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:41.530 align:middle line:84%
for myself as a meditation
practice, is instead of doing

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:44.290 align:middle line:84%
the forms that I was
taught, what I would do

00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:47.120 align:middle line:84%
is I would say the energy
changes moment to moment.

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: And
depending on what you

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:53.650 align:middle line:84%
eat, how much water is in your
body, the location on Earth,

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:57.580 align:middle line:84%
you may need a very
specific energy.

00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:01.390 align:middle line:84%
So what I would do is I would
meditate and try to feel.

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:05.860 align:middle line:84%
What energy posture do
I need at this moment,

00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:08.390 align:middle line:84%
so my body would actually
take over and tune itself?

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:10.720 align:middle line:90%

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:51.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:53.548 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: So basically,
you're putting the hands

00:52:53.548 --> 00:52:54.770 align:middle line:90%
over the heart.

00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And what we're doing is it's
almost like a pulsation effect.

00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:00.500 align:middle line:90%
So we're meditating.

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.030 align:middle line:90%
We're taking breaths.

00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And this time our hands are
actually touching the heart.

00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And basically, you
breathe, let's say, three

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:10.580 align:middle line:90%
in and out breaths.

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And then you open the
hands over the heart.

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And what that will
do is it creates

00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:20.660 align:middle line:84%
this kind of pulsation
effect over the heart, which

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.060 align:middle line:84%
breaks down energetic
blockages around the heart.

00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Because the heart is
very, very important

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.350 align:middle line:90%
for our energetic system.

00:53:27.350 --> 00:53:29.660 align:middle line:84%
It's our connection
to the universe.

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:33.050 align:middle line:84%
It's our connection to our
environment, people around us

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:34.710 align:middle line:90%
to ourselves.

00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:38.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very important area of
the body that needs attention,

00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:40.355 align:middle line:90%
especially energetic attention.

00:53:40.355 --> 00:53:42.063 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we just
take it for granted

00:53:42.063 --> 00:53:44.720 align:middle line:84%
and assume it'll keep pumping
until it stops, right?

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:45.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:48.650 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is, when
your energy is really low

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:52.540 align:middle line:84%
or if you've been crushed or
traumatized by events in life,

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:56.300 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the heart feels
very diminished and weak.

00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm assuming
you're saying that

00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:02.000 align:middle line:84%
in doing this posture,
we can start enlivening

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.290 align:middle line:90%
the energy of the heart again.

00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: Yes, it's
almost like awakening

00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:08.040 align:middle line:90%
the energy of the heart.

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And when you have your hands
closed, you're building energy.

00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:16.170 align:middle line:84%
When you have the hands opened,
you're transferring the energy.

00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:19.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's this kind of
energetic polarity again

00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:21.670 align:middle line:84%
that starts to
open and break down

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:24.860 align:middle line:84%
the blockages around the
heart, which allows a greater

00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:27.650 align:middle line:84%
flow of consciousness
of energy to flow

00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:29.367 align:middle line:90%
through the entire body.

00:54:29.367 --> 00:54:30.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:31.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go to
Wings of the Pharaoh.

00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:32.180 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Sure.

00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because we're running
toward the end of the show.

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:35.160 align:middle line:90%
And I want to get this stuff in.

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.200 align:middle line:90%
so Wings of the Pharaoh.

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Of course.

00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:01.520 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
spiritual posture.

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And it works on opening up
the higher consciousness self.

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:09.590 align:middle line:84%
It works on helping to
enhance the spiritual energies

00:55:09.590 --> 00:55:10.880 align:middle line:90%
of the dreamworld.

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:14.310 align:middle line:84%
It also prepares your energy
for out-of-body experiences,

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:18.050 align:middle line:84%
which is astral travel
or dimensional travel.

00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's also very good for
clearing out old memories,

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:23.780 align:middle line:90%
so it is--

00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:24.738 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Subconscious?

00:55:24.738 --> 00:55:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: --subconscious
memories.

00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:30.600 align:middle line:84%
I'll say like past life
memories, traumas, wounds.

00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:34.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a very good
posture for that.

00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And also, it's very
helpful, I believe,

00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:41.023 align:middle line:84%
for people that may
suffer with addictions.

00:55:41.023 --> 00:55:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:42.870 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yes.

00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In this motion,
you're pushing the energy away

00:55:45.930 --> 00:55:47.280 align:middle line:90%
as you go this direction.

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Whichever direction you go,
you're pushing the energy away.

00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:51.060 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yes.

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like you're
expanding the spiritual fields.

00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Think of it like you're almost
expanding the auric field out.

That's powerful.

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yes.

00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:34.430 align:middle line:90%
This one is very special.

00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Because, yes, we have this
chakra above our heads

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:41.420 align:middle line:84%
that connects to this very
powerful celestial energy.

00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:44.815 align:middle line:90%
But we can move this chakra.

00:56:44.815 --> 00:56:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually
take the chakra

00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:52.250 align:middle line:84%
and bring it down, through
the rest of the chakra system.

00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:54.260 align:middle line:84%
So we're taking
the higher chakra

00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:56.450 align:middle line:84%
and pulling it down, through
the rest of the chakra

00:56:56.450 --> 00:57:00.440 align:middle line:84%
system, which ignites every
chakra with that healing fire

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:01.380 align:middle line:90%

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:03.505 align:middle line:90%
It purifies the entire body.

00:57:03.505 --> 00:57:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And then when it goes through
the chakras, it goes--

00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:08.485 align:middle line:84%
pops right back up,
above your head.

00:57:08.485 --> 00:57:09.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:13.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, so as we're just
about out of time here,

00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:17.180 align:middle line:84%
so have you-- is this kind
of an Egyptian qigong,

00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:19.130 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, that
you've created?

00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>>QUITT: I would say it's
an Egyptian qigong that I've

00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:21.870 align:middle line:90%
remembered.

00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:23.245 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That
you've remembered?

00:57:23.245 --> 00:57:24.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that you've remembered.

00:57:24.690 --> 00:57:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And so you can do
these individually

00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:29.730 align:middle line:84%
or you can flow between
these postures, right?

00:57:29.730 --> 00:57:30.530 align:middle line:90%
>>QUITT: Yes.

00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:33.350 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I would say it's a very
powerful energetic practice

00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:35.780 align:middle line:10%
to get to know
your own energies.

00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:38.240 align:middle line:10%
It's extremely
important, I believe.

00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:40.530 align:middle line:10%
And it enhances your gifts.

00:57:40.530 --> 00:57:42.800 align:middle line:10%
It enhances your life force.

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you more
sensitive to energy.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So the more we work on our
energy, it's like a muscle

00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:52.760 align:middle line:84%
that we're strengthening,
where we can actually

00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:56.570 align:middle line:84%
feel and have this psychic
intuition from the energies

00:57:56.570 --> 00:57:57.890 align:middle line:90%
