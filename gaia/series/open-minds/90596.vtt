00:00:05.544 --> 00:00:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Welcome
to "Open Minds" on the road.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.720 align:middle line:84%
We're here in Joshua
Tree, California

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.089 align:middle line:90%
at "Contact in the Desert."

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:12.630 align:middle line:10%
In a moment, I'm
going to be speaking

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.540 align:middle line:10%
with Richard Dolan,
who's going to share

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.369 align:middle line:10%
with us the rich history of
UFO contact in the military.

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.361 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:40.860 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.270 align:middle line:84%
So Richard, you
and I have talked

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.520 align:middle line:84%
about the history of
the military and ufology

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.772 align:middle line:84%
and also a lot of the
cover-ups and so forth.

00:00:49.772 --> 00:00:51.730 align:middle line:84%
One of the events I wanted
to get into with you

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.510 align:middle line:90%
is the Rendlesham event.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Prior to the juicy stuff we're
going to get into a little bit

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.570 align:middle line:84%
later-- because you
started dropping

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.000 align:middle line:84%
into some of the on
the ground phenomena

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.600 align:middle line:84%
that's happening
around the world,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.975 align:middle line:84%
and some very specific types
of beings that have come up.

00:01:04.975 --> 00:01:06.999 align:middle line:84%
But let's go down the
military rabbit hole

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:08.790 align:middle line:84%
just a little bit on
the Rendlesham affair.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.831 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARD DOLAN: Oh yeah.

00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:12.830 align:middle line:10%
Well, Rendlesham--
OK, Bentwaters,

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.570 align:middle line:10%
Woodbridge case from 1980 is one
of the most important UFO cases

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.620 align:middle line:10%
in-- of all time, I think, A,
because of intrinsically what

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.260 align:middle line:10%
happened--

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.300 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Give a
little background

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.200 align:middle line:10%
on that for people
who are newbies.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's right.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.110 align:middle line:90%
And then B, the documentation.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.940 align:middle line:10%
So what actually happened is
that at Christmas night, 1980,

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.760 align:middle line:10%
and then for several nights
in the aftermath of this,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.190 align:middle line:10%
there was a series of
events at this base.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.180 align:middle line:10%
This is an American
base on UK soil.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Late 1980, the height
of the Cold War,

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.350 align:middle line:84%
there was actually a lot of
Cold War tensions going on.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And at this
particular time, there

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.380 align:middle line:84%
was a landed UFO that was
seen by several US Air Force

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.270 align:middle line:90%
personnel.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.830 align:middle line:90%
That was on one night.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Some of those guys
got very, very close

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.270 align:middle line:84%
to it-- got a very
good look at it.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.860 align:middle line:10%
On another night, subsequently,
the deputy wing commander,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.280 align:middle line:10%
Lieutenant Colonel Charles
Halt led a group of his men

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.330 align:middle line:10%
out because there was another
UFO report in the wooded area

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.634 align:middle line:10%
outside the base in
the Rendlesham forest.

00:02:10.634 --> 00:02:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And on that
particular night, they

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:84%
saw a lot of maneuvering,
impossible maneuvers

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.250 align:middle line:84%
by a craft, including
at one point

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.420 align:middle line:84%
a beam of light, laser-like
light that shone down

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.120 align:middle line:84%
into the ground where
nuclear ordinance was

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.380 align:middle line:90%
being stored at the time.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.839 align:middle line:84%
And this is something,
by the way--

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:30.463 align:middle line:84%
Nick Pope is a friend
of mine, but this

00:02:30.463 --> 00:02:32.310 align:middle line:84%
is something he won't
be able to get into.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.761 align:middle line:84%
That's interesting,
because I just finished

00:02:34.761 --> 00:02:38.680 align:middle line:84%
interviewing Robert Salas
about the silo shutdowns two

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.760 align:middle line:90%
decades prior to that.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.660 align:middle line:84%
So this, again, is
following that theme

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.952 align:middle line:90%
of following the nuclear silos.

00:02:42.952 --> 00:02:45.285 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: It's one of the key
things about the Rendlesham

00:02:45.285 --> 00:02:46.810 align:middle line:90%
case that often gets overlooked.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.440 align:middle line:90%
Nukes were at that base.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.965 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, it has not
officially been acknowledged.

00:02:50.965 --> 00:02:52.497 align:middle line:10%
This is what we
call an open secret.

00:02:52.497 --> 00:02:54.080 align:middle line:10%
Everyone knows there
were nukes there.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.760 align:middle line:10%
The British public
would have been furious

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.140 align:middle line:10%
if they'd known that there were
nuclear weapons at that base.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.410 align:middle line:10%
There was a strong
anti-nuke sentiment

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.190 align:middle line:10%
going on in the
country at that time.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So it was just
all done secretly.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.680 align:middle line:84%
But that was the forward
NATO nuclear base.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.870 align:middle line:84%
So if anything went
down with the Russians,

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.130 align:middle line:84%
with the Soviet Union,
presumably their base

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:84%
would have been on
a super-high alert.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So in that context, this
whole thing happened.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And as Charles Halt said to
two individuals, Peter Robbins,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.640 align:middle line:84%
a very good friend of mine,
and airman Larry Warren

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.680 align:middle line:84%
in the mid-'90s, he said
that beam of light, quote,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.174 align:middle line:84%
adversely affected
the ordinance.

00:03:33.174 --> 00:03:35.590 align:middle line:84%
It went down through the dirt,
through layers of concrete,

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:84%
through more dirt, and affected
that nuclear ordinance.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.027 align:middle line:84%
To me, that's probably the
single most significant thing

00:03:42.027 --> 00:03:42.860 align:middle line:90%
of the entire event.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's not
why people talk about it.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why is it considered
the most well-documented event?

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.294 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what's the story?

00:03:49.294 --> 00:03:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: It's very
well-documented

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.550 align:middle line:84%
for a key reason,
which is that there

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.810 align:middle line:84%
is an official memo written
about it by Colonel Charles

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Halt a few weeks
after it occurred.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.800 align:middle line:84%
So that was absolute
confirmation of the event.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.590 align:middle line:10%
On top of that--

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.850 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It wasn't
classified immediately, or--

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.950 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: It was
classified, but it was then

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.510 align:middle line:10%
retrieved a few years
later through a Freedom

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.680 align:middle line:10%
of Information Act request.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.899 align:middle line:84%
And almost, you would
say, by a stroke of luck,

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:84%
it was able to be obtained
and we have this confirmation.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.060 align:middle line:84%
In the aftermath of
that, all the witnesses

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.460 align:middle line:84%
started coming out--
not immediately.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.500 align:middle line:84%
All through the
1980s, this is a story

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.320 align:middle line:84%
that developed with more
witnesses, more witnesses

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.380 align:middle line:90%
through the 1990s.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, even
into the 21st century

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.810 align:middle line:84%
we've had even more
additions to the story.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.550 align:middle line:84%
So the Rendlesham case, it's
like a gift that keeps giving.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.280 align:middle line:90%
We didn't get it all at once.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.830 align:middle line:84%
It's come out by-- partly
by drips and drabs,

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.820 align:middle line:84%
but now it's a flood
of information.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So I have a
question to ask you then.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:90%
How many cases have to come out?

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.070 align:middle line:84%
It's been 50 years--
well, if you go back

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.030 align:middle line:84%
as far as Roswell,
60 years-- more,

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.360 align:middle line:84%
that these cases
have been coming out.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.380 align:middle line:84%
At what point does the
government, the military,

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.680 align:middle line:84%
some official agencies
say, OK, right.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.740 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
becoming absurd now.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: I agree with you.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Couple thousand
people in the desert,

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.650 align:middle line:90%
they all know it.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: We're at a point
where the emperor is

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.025 align:middle line:90%
wearing no clothes.

00:05:16.025 --> 00:05:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Someone's going
to make the point

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.400 align:middle line:84%
and say, look, he's not
wearing anything at all.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.060 align:middle line:84%
We're just about
there, it seems to me.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.830 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we've
had 20 years of internet

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and really 10 years of
a true internet, where

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.110 align:middle line:90%
we have all of this.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.940 align:middle line:90%
We have a web.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.404 align:middle line:90%
We have Gaiam TV.

00:05:29.404 --> 00:05:30.070 align:middle line:90%
We have YouTube.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.360 align:middle line:90%
We have Skype.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.200 align:middle line:84%
We have Facebook, all these
ways that we communicate with,

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.100 align:middle line:90%
all in the last decade, really.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.220 align:middle line:90%
So it's all new.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think what we
can see is that this

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.750 align:middle line:84%
has had a dramatic, profound
effect on our civilization.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.330 align:middle line:84%
But what we have
is the old paradigm

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.950 align:middle line:84%
is hanging on by
their fingernails.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.934 align:middle line:84%
And that old paradigm is one
of denial of the obvious.

00:05:52.934 --> 00:05:54.600 align:middle line:84%
I was going to say
the truth, but really

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.610 align:middle line:84%
denial of the obvious
I think is more apt.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.970 align:middle line:84%
So that-- you know
there's the expression,

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.330 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing so powerful as
an idea whose time has come.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.370 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
part of that,

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.750 align:middle line:84%
which is the second
most powerful thing is

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.234 align:middle line:90%
an idea that refuses to go away.

00:06:12.234 --> 00:06:13.400 align:middle line:90%
And that's where they're at.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.730 align:middle line:90%
So they're hanging on.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.475 align:middle line:90%
That paradigm is still there.

00:06:18.475 --> 00:06:20.600 align:middle line:84%
But I think what we're
seeing is a real battle here

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.847 align:middle line:90%
between the old and the new.

00:06:21.847 --> 00:06:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I totally agree.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.679 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me
that events like this--

00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:26.790 align:middle line:84%
there are many UFO
congresses of different kinds

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:27.570 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Seems like events like this
will ultimately, themselves,

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.350 align:middle line:90%
disappear.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Once there's disclosure
and it's out there,

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.830 align:middle line:84%
then the gathering will
happen in a different way.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.010 align:middle line:84%
We're going to up the
subject matter to something

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.600 align:middle line:84%
maybe more to do
with consciousness

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.590 align:middle line:84%
than this event occurred,
this event occurred,

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:42.300 align:middle line:90%
and this event occurred.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Maybe.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.620 align:middle line:84%
I think-- yes, I think
that'll be part of it.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.870 align:middle line:84%
I suspect there'll be a lot
of political repercussions

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:47.190 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.660 align:middle line:84%
I think there will be a lot of
energy repercussions of this.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.400 align:middle line:84%
We're talking the world
AD, after disclosure.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.410 align:middle line:90%
I wrote a book on it.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and
we talked about that.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Right.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:54.480 align:middle line:90%
And I think--

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Go over
some of that again,

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.230 align:middle line:84%
for anyone who didn't
see our last interview.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.604 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, a number of
years ago I co-authored a book

00:06:59.604 --> 00:07:01.170 align:middle line:90%
with a fellow named Bryce Zabel.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.005 align:middle line:84%
And we called it "AD:
After Disclosure."

00:07:03.005 --> 00:07:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's really our attempt
to look into the future

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.586 align:middle line:90%
as a think tank would.

00:07:09.586 --> 00:07:14.020 align:middle line:84%
In a world in which UFO
secrecy ended, A, how might

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.220 align:middle line:84%
it end, and we try
to puzzle that one

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.310 align:middle line:90%
through in different ways.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.420 align:middle line:84%
But then really, more
significantly, B, what then?

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.740 align:middle line:84%
What is the world likely to
be like after the disclosure

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.020 align:middle line:90%
of a UFO/ET reality?

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And what I think
we found is that it

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.037 align:middle line:84%
would be a truly
revolutionary event--

00:07:33.037 --> 00:07:35.120 align:middle line:84%
yes, in terms of human
consciousness in many ways,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.900 align:middle line:84%
but really, even
more prosaically

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.160 align:middle line:84%
in our immediate political
system, political blowback,

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.200 align:middle line:90%
and in terms of energy.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.645 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Technology,
absolutely.

00:07:43.645 --> 00:07:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Whatever these objects
or craft are operating on,

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:52.360 align:middle line:84%
it's post-petroleum, whether
it's clean fusion or zero point

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.480 align:middle line:84%
energy, or something
even beyond that, it

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.000 align:middle line:84%
means a complete
overhaul, a total overall

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.450 align:middle line:84%
of our global technological
infrastructure.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.170 align:middle line:90%
And that's a huge thing.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:03.671 align:middle line:90%
So I think--

00:08:03.671 --> 00:08:05.045 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And of
course, you have

00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:07.250 align:middle line:84%
a lot-- there are a lot of
agencies and corporations

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.700 align:middle line:90%
in resistance to that still.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's right.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.801 align:middle line:84%
So after that, we'll
continue to meet

00:08:10.801 --> 00:08:12.920 align:middle line:90%
and they'll continue to spin.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think we'll still be
having these conferences.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.290 align:middle line:84%
But the difference
will be, we'll

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.880 align:middle line:84%
be having a lot more mainstream
coverage on it, I suspect.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely, not just
Gaiam and another alternative

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:22.589 align:middle line:90%
networks.

00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, Gaiam
will be mainstream.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Gaiam will be the--
hopefully the NBC,

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.410 align:middle line:90%
but not the evil version.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.725 align:middle line:90%
So you'll still be good.

00:08:29.725 --> 00:08:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now, you've
taken another direction, too.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you and I haven't
talked about this before,

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.700 align:middle line:84%
and that is the nature
of close contact

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.580 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrial beings,
in particular groups of beings.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And you just finished a
workshop about an hour ago

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:46.850 align:middle line:90%
on this topic.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.730 align:middle line:84%
I would like you
to launch into why

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.850 align:middle line:84%
you started going down-- you
haven't written a book on this

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.680 align:middle line:84%
yet-- why you started going
down this road and the nature

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.210 align:middle line:84%
of some of these types of
beings that you're talking about

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:58.430 align:middle line:90%
and the types of contact.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:59.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Yes, by all means.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, people should understand.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.420 align:middle line:84%
I think when I broke
into this field about 15,

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.470 align:middle line:84%
almost 15 years ago, I wrote a
very sober historical analysis

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.526 align:middle line:84%
of the military
dimensions of UFOs.

00:09:10.526 --> 00:09:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's how everyone
got to know me.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.525 align:middle line:84%
What they didn't
probably realize

00:09:13.525 --> 00:09:17.380 align:middle line:84%
is that my training
is as a historian,

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.030 align:middle line:84%
but my training also is in
literature and philosophy.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And my mind has always
work that way-- always

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:90%
has worked that way.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:31.007 align:middle line:84%
I entered the UFO field,
and for me to remain only

00:09:31.007 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:84%
dealing with military
documents when there's

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.085 align:middle line:84%
this incredible
universe, this ocean--

00:09:35.085 --> 00:09:36.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm so glad
to hear you say this.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: --it would be
like going into the ocean

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.870 align:middle line:84%
and putting my little one
toe in there, saying, well,

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:41.879 align:middle line:90%
that's enough.

00:09:41.879 --> 00:09:43.170 align:middle line:90%
So I've decided to go swimming.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's is an inevitable
part of my personality.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.510 align:middle line:84%
I've sought over
these years to try

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.870 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
totality of what

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.300 align:middle line:90%
we call the UFO phenomenon.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.200 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big totality.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
I've got it all.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.840 align:middle line:84%
But I am suggesting
I've tried to comprehend

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.540 align:middle line:84%
all of the aspects
of it, whether that's

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.420 align:middle line:84%
the history from ancient aliens
to today, or the politics,

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.344 align:middle line:84%
which still remains central
to my interest-- that

00:10:08.344 --> 00:10:09.760 align:middle line:84%
is, the politics
of the cover-up--

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and let's call the deep politics
of the breakaway civilization,

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.090 align:middle line:90%
which we've talked about.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:16.120 align:middle line:10%
But then also, things
like the science,

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:10%
the crazy science which
doesn't make sense,

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.784 align:middle line:10%
but actually does make sense
when you look at leading edge

00:10:21.784 --> 00:10:23.950 align:middle line:10%
scientific theories, whether
dealing with propulsion

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:30.320 align:middle line:10%
or space-time or entanglement
or consciousness itself--

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.620 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Stargate technology.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Exactly, Regina.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.330 align:middle line:84%
So all of these which seem
impossible to scientists

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.220 align:middle line:84%
of the previous
generation are actually

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.900 align:middle line:84%
now becoming more
comprehensible.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:40.920 align:middle line:90%
So that's part of it.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And then another part of
it is human encounters

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.751 align:middle line:84%
with these-- apparent,
let us say, non-humans.

00:10:46.751 --> 00:10:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this
is the first time

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.624 align:middle line:84%
I've heard you,
at least with me,

00:10:49.624 --> 00:10:51.600 align:middle line:90%
coming forward on that level.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.860 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Probably.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not that I would
run away from it in the past.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.860 align:middle line:84%
But it always seemed to be a
little more opportune for me

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.459 align:middle line:84%
to talk about military,
political aspects of it.

00:11:01.459 --> 00:11:02.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So let's get into it.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:03.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Well, yeah.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:03.879 align:middle line:90%
Let's get into it.

00:11:03.879 --> 00:11:07.850 align:middle line:84%
So what's happened is that
not only-- the UFO reality

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.600 align:middle line:84%
is filled with all of
these discrepancies.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.740 align:middle line:84%
One of the
discrepancies is there

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.190 align:middle line:84%
are thousands of sightings
in North America every year,

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.640 align:middle line:84%
and yet still it gets no love
from the mainstream media.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.030 align:middle line:10%
Another discrepancy
is that there

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:21.890 align:middle line:10%
are many, many encounters,
a shockingly large number

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.700 align:middle line:10%
of encounters, I believe, that
people, ordinary people have

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:31.790 align:middle line:10%
with beings that are
absolutely not ordinary,

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:35.220 align:middle line:10%
and which lead me to
probably connect them

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.920 align:middle line:10%
with what we'd call
UFO/ET phenomena.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.290 align:middle line:84%
So one such example would be
what some researchers might

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:42.660 align:middle line:90%
have called the tall whites.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.880 align:middle line:84%
I've run into a number of cases
personally from individuals

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.670 align:middle line:84%
who have encountered
beings that seem like this.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.653 align:middle line:10%
One perfect example
of this would

00:11:50.653 --> 00:11:55.650 align:middle line:10%
be one I got from a retired US
Air Force Colonel, a man who

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.570 align:middle line:10%
also has a Ph.D. and a
wonderful guy, sharp guy.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Did a lot of classified
work in his day

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.870 align:middle line:84%
and had a strong not
only interest in UFO/ET

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:07.880 align:middle line:84%
but had had some work to do with
it in his professional capacity

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.050 align:middle line:90%
in the Air Force.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:11.800 align:middle line:84%
But the story that he told
me was in a private capacity.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is just
incredible stuff.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.277 align:middle line:90%
I met with him and his wife.

00:12:15.277 --> 00:12:16.610 align:middle line:90%
And they were both sitting down.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And they told me of a time
that they were in a Las Vegas

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Casino-- this is in the
1990s-- with a friend of theirs

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.880 align:middle line:84%
who happened to be-- they
described as psychic.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.130 align:middle line:90%
So they were all good friends.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.040 align:middle line:90%
And they were in this casino.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:84%
I believe he said it
was the Wynn, which

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.180 align:middle line:90%
is a beautiful place.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.375 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, Steve Wynn's.

00:12:35.375 --> 00:12:37.879 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Yes, they were
on the second floor,

00:12:37.879 --> 00:12:38.670 align:middle line:90%
having a good time.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And the psychic friend
grabbed the colonel

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.130 align:middle line:84%
by the upper arm like
this, and said, "Stop."

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:49.580 align:middle line:84%
And she motioned to a shockingly
beautiful blonde woman

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.210 align:middle line:90%
maybe 20 feet away or so.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "She's
not one of us.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:55.550 align:middle line:90%
She's not like us."

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's Las
Vegas and there are

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:58.220 align:middle line:84%
a lot of beautiful
people in Las Vegas.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.261 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Including
shockingly beautiful blondes.

00:13:00.261 --> 00:13:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: That's exactly right.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.200 align:middle line:84%
But something got the
attention of this woman.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.420 align:middle line:90%
She became scared, nervous.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.230 align:middle line:84%
So she and the man's wife
went down the escalator,

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.037 align:middle line:90%
actually to get away.

00:13:10.037 --> 00:13:11.870 align:middle line:84%
The colonel stayed there
for a little while.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.661 align:middle line:84%
And he's looking at
this woman and her back

00:13:13.661 --> 00:13:15.410 align:middle line:90%
is partly turned to him.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And he's staring at her and
she turns ever so slightly.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:25.052 align:middle line:84%
And then he said to me, "That's
when I heard her in my mind."

00:13:25.052 --> 00:13:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And she sounded, he said,
almost like, I would think,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:31.070 align:middle line:84%
like a police officer on the
beat saying something like,

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:32.750 align:middle line:90%
"Nothing to see here.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.310 align:middle line:90%
Go about your business.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:35.360 align:middle line:90%
Just go on."

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.401 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Telepathically.

00:13:36.401 --> 00:13:37.607 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Right, exactly.

00:13:37.607 --> 00:13:38.940 align:middle line:90%
So he was a bit shocked by that.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.310 align:middle line:90%
He was a bit surprised.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:41.380 align:middle line:90%
He stayed there.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And moments later,
she was joined

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:45.451 align:middle line:84%
by an equally
beautiful blonde man.

00:13:45.451 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And both of them,
incidentally, were

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:51.560 align:middle line:84%
wearing incredibly
beautiful blue clothing.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.540 align:middle line:90%
He joins her.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.580 align:middle line:90%
They're obviously a pair.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.550 align:middle line:84%
They chat for a little
while or they're there.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.270 align:middle line:84%
He can't hear anything
at this point.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.846 align:middle line:84%
And then they began walking
toward the escalator.

00:14:00.846 --> 00:14:01.970 align:middle line:90%
And he's thinking, perfect.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:02.595 align:middle line:90%
I'm right here.

00:14:02.595 --> 00:14:03.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to talk to them.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.600 align:middle line:90%
And he's getting his courage up.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.410 align:middle line:90%
He's a colonel.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:08.390 align:middle line:90%
Tough guy.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:09.910 align:middle line:90%
He's nervous about this.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:12.540 align:middle line:84%
They're coming toward him
and then he says nothing.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.366 align:middle line:90%
They walk by him.

00:14:13.366 --> 00:14:14.490 align:middle line:90%
They go down the escalator.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.610 align:middle line:84%
He starts now following
them down the escalator,

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.590 align:middle line:90%
a few feet just behind them.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And he continues to hear
them conversing in the mind.

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:25.710 align:middle line:90%
They're not speaking.

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:26.580 align:middle line:90%
He's hearing them.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And the conversation
was something like,

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.290 align:middle line:90%
"Yes, he hears us.

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, no big deal.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:33.500 align:middle line:90%
He's nobody important.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.327 align:middle line:84%
We'll just go about
our business."

00:14:35.327 --> 00:14:37.160 align:middle line:84%
They get down to the
bottom of the escalator

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.110 align:middle line:90%
and they walk off.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.050 align:middle line:90%
He stays there.

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:43.482 align:middle line:84%
The followup is actually,
I would say creepy.

00:14:43.482 --> 00:14:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Their friend, who was
not just psychic, but was

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.570 align:middle line:84%
also a hypnotherapist,
said to him,

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.990 align:middle line:84%
hey, why don't we
get together soon

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and I'll regress you
so that maybe you

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:56.360 align:middle line:84%
can remember more clearly all
the details of what they said.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, well,
that's a good idea.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Two days later, or
about two days later,

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.750 align:middle line:84%
he's at her home in
a-- not far from where

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.960 align:middle line:84%
we are, in eastern California
in the desert region,

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.520 align:middle line:84%
I believe in a
quiet neighborhood--

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.140 align:middle line:84%
cul-de-sac type
of a neighborhood.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.140 align:middle line:90%
He's in her living room.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.021 align:middle line:84%
He's lying down on the couch
and she's about to regress him,

00:15:13.021 --> 00:15:14.520 align:middle line:84%
when they start
hearing construction

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.627 align:middle line:84%
noises-- jackhammers,
all of this machinery.

00:15:17.627 --> 00:15:18.960 align:middle line:90%
They're thinking, wait a minute.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.209 align:middle line:90%
We're in a quiet neighborhood.

00:15:20.209 --> 00:15:21.120 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.578 align:middle line:84%
Eventually they go
outside to look.

00:15:22.578 --> 00:15:23.810 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:24.650 align:middle line:90%
He goes back down.

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Every time he tries
to regress, nothing.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:28.410 align:middle line:90%
It's too much noise.

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:30.630 align:middle line:90%
So he says, "No problem.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be back
here in about a month.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:33.350 align:middle line:90%
I'll call you.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:35.540 align:middle line:84%
We'll set it up and
we'll do it again."

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.330 align:middle line:90%
So a month goes by.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:38.460 align:middle line:90%
He calls his friend.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.305 align:middle line:90%
He calls her.

00:15:39.305 --> 00:15:41.730 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Hey, I'm coming
into town in a day or two.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:44.200 align:middle line:84%
How about we get together
to do that regression?"

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.850 align:middle line:90%
She says, "What regression?

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:46.620 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?"

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.090 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Well,
about last month.

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Las Vegas." "What?" "We
saw those blonde beings.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.770 align:middle line:90%
Don't you remember?"

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:53.610 align:middle line:90%
She had no memory.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's not the
only story, though.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.740 align:middle line:84%
You told me off-camera there's
another story similar to this.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.865 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: No, and it's
actually just as fascinating.

00:16:00.865 --> 00:16:04.120 align:middle line:10%
It was told to me by a woman two
years after I got the colonel

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.980 align:middle line:10%
story, on the other
side of the country.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.530 align:middle line:10%
I was in western Pennsylvania.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:10.997 align:middle line:90%
She was about 60 years old.

00:16:10.997 --> 00:16:12.080 align:middle line:90%
She came with her husband.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.130 align:middle line:84%
She was-- I don't know
what her career was,

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.527 align:middle line:84%
but she was like a
housewife-- a regular lady.

00:16:16.527 --> 00:16:18.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
else to describe her.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.151 align:middle line:90%
She comes up to my table.

00:16:19.151 --> 00:16:20.240 align:middle line:90%
I was at a conference.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.614 align:middle line:84%
And she says, "I
have to tell you

00:16:21.614 --> 00:16:23.450 align:middle line:90%
something that's really crazy."

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.230 align:middle line:84%
So back in the mid-1960s, she
said, when I was a teenager,

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:27.660 align:middle line:90%
I was about 15 years old.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.489 align:middle line:90%
I was in church with my mother.

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:31.405 align:middle line:84%
Everyone in our town,
she said, knew everyone.

00:16:31.405 --> 00:16:33.750 align:middle line:84%
It was a tiny little town
in western Pennsylvania,

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.409 align:middle line:90%
especially in church.

00:16:35.409 --> 00:16:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sitting next
to my mom and I'm

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:38.910 align:middle line:84%
in the church pews,
a Catholic mass.

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And she says this blonde
couple wearing perfectly blue

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:46.840 align:middle line:84%
clothing, supermodel male female
blonde sit in front of me,

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.300 align:middle line:90%
she says.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.360 align:middle line:90%
And she's transfixed by them.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.390 align:middle line:90%
She's 15 years old.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:52.774 align:middle line:90%
She's really into fashion.

00:16:52.774 --> 00:16:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And she's looking at
their fabric, which

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.780 align:middle line:84%
she said was beyond anything
that she'd ever seen.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.694 align:middle line:84%
And what shocked
her, partly, was

00:17:00.694 --> 00:17:02.610 align:middle line:84%
that no one else seemed
to be paying attention

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:03.600 align:middle line:90%
to this couple.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.199 align:middle line:90%
She can't notice anything else.

00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:07.740 align:middle line:84%
She's thinking, who
are these people?

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.010 align:middle line:84%
They're like angels having
descended into human bodies.

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And they look like the
most amazing human beings

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:14.850 align:middle line:90%
she's ever seen.

00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:16.349 align:middle line:84%
And she's observing
them and she can

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:18.473 align:middle line:84%
tell that they hadn't been
to many Catholic masses,

00:17:18.473 --> 00:17:21.409 align:middle line:84%
because they're, you
know, kneel, gesticulate,

00:17:21.409 --> 00:17:22.450 align:middle line:90%
do the sign of the cross.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.687 align:middle line:84%
I grew up going to a
lot of Catholic mass.

00:17:24.687 --> 00:17:25.520 align:middle line:90%
And they obviously--

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.103 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They didn't
know what to do.

00:17:27.103 --> 00:17:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: No.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:33.830 align:middle line:84%
However, then she said to
me, I heard them in my mind,

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.750 align:middle line:84%
just like the colonel
had said to me.

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And what she heard was one of
them thinking to the other,

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:42.870 align:middle line:84%
we appear to be
fitting in well here.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And then the other one
said, or thought, yes,

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.150 align:middle line:84%
except for the girl
behind us who can hear us.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And that at that moment--
I know, it is funny.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.490 align:middle line:90%
But could you imagine being her?

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.140 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not so funny.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:58.450 align:middle line:90%
She was very nervous.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.450 align:middle line:84%
At that point, she heard
nothing more from them.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.789 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they shut it
down or did whatever.

00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's interesting,
because a lot of the people

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.900 align:middle line:84%
even at this conference, a
lot of the presenters even who

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.280 align:middle line:84%
talk about having
interactions, it's

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.240 align:middle line:84%
with these beautiful
blonde beings.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.350 align:middle line:84%
They're almost always
depicted in blue.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:20.152 align:middle line:84%
But they're depicted as being
allies, very loving, very

00:18:20.152 --> 00:18:20.860 align:middle line:90%
clean intentions.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what
I'm hearing here.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: No, these are
rather standoffish, frankly.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And the encounters that
I have at least obtained,

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:31.370 align:middle line:84%
I've not had the idea-- and
there's several others that I'm

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:84%
thinking of here-- where
they are really not

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.284 align:middle line:84%
interested in interacting,
at least with most people.

00:18:36.284 --> 00:18:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have you
gotten any idea

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.241 align:middle line:84%
from the various
people you've talked

00:18:39.241 --> 00:18:41.410 align:middle line:84%
to about their
encounters as to what

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:43.840 align:middle line:84%
these beautiful
blondes are doing here.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean besides trying
to blend-- why?

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: No.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is where
we have to speculate.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I want to
finish this other story.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.555 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah, I
thought you were done.

00:18:52.555 --> 00:18:53.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.083 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: No, because it
actually gets even better.

00:18:55.083 --> 00:18:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, sorry.

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:58.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: We're having fun.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.860 align:middle line:90%
Mass eventually ends, of course.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.690 align:middle line:84%
They're in the
middle of the church.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:06.300 align:middle line:84%
This couple somehow gets
up and they're out, fast.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.830 align:middle line:90%
They're ahead of the crowd.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.140 align:middle line:90%
So this 15-year-old girl--

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They didn't stop for
their cookies and Kool-Aid?

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: None of that.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Right, the Kool-Aid.

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:15.590 align:middle line:84%
She gets some gumption
and some courage

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:17.920 align:middle line:84%
and she decides she's
going to follow them.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.590 align:middle line:84%
So she bolts out and she
presses through the crowd.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Her mother,
incidentally, oblivious

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.460 align:middle line:84%
to the whole situation,
is screaming after her,

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.610 align:middle line:90%
"Get back here, young lady.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:26.985 align:middle line:84%
Where do you think
you're going?"

00:19:26.985 --> 00:19:28.170 align:middle line:90%
And this girl just goes.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:30.190 align:middle line:84%
She works her the way
through the crowd.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.810 align:middle line:84%
She gets to the front of the
church and she sees the couple.

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:33.840 align:middle line:90%
They've gone really quickly.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.160 align:middle line:84%
They've gone across
the parking lot.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.618 align:middle line:84%
They're at the top of this hill
and they go over this hill.

00:19:37.618 --> 00:19:41.030 align:middle line:84%
She trots up there and she
gets to where they were.

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And they're now across a field,
walking fast to a wooded area.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And she starts down
after them and then stops

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.314 align:middle line:90%
dead in her tracks.

00:19:51.314 --> 00:19:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And the reason she stops
dead in her tracks is

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:middle line:84%
she saw a third being,
who, she said to me--

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.590 align:middle line:84%
she said, do you remember the TV
character Lurch from the Addams

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:02.020 align:middle line:90%
Family?

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Tall, black suit,
black hat, very tall,

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.150 align:middle line:84%
apparently, which
really frightened her.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:09.880 align:middle line:90%
And she stopped.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.861 align:middle line:90%
That intimidated her.

00:20:10.861 --> 00:20:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And she watched this
blonde couple walk right up

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.940 align:middle line:84%
to the tall being, passed
him into the woods.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.770 align:middle line:84%
He turned around and
followed them in.

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:17.704 align:middle line:90%
That's the full story.

00:20:17.704 --> 00:20:18.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: So this is
a strange encounter.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:22.810 align:middle line:90%
What were they doing?

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Were they trying
to blend in to see

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:30.500 align:middle line:84%
if they could fit into a
small town church environment

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.750 align:middle line:90%
without being noticed?

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, they were mostly
successful, almost successful.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.740 align:middle line:84%
But one girl, who
for whatever reason,

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.080 align:middle line:84%
maybe physical
proximity, maybe she

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.460 align:middle line:84%
had psychic ability--
she heard them.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when you look
at it, not just physically,

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.610 align:middle line:84%
but also those who are able
to phase in between dimensions

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.304 align:middle line:84%
and appear to be
physical-- I mean,

00:20:51.304 --> 00:20:52.970 align:middle line:84%
one of the interviews
I was going to do,

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:54.540 align:middle line:84%
except he ended up
with heat stroke,

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:84%
was with Nick Redfern
talking about the men

00:20:56.870 --> 00:21:01.115 align:middle line:90%
in black-- these little fellows.

00:21:01.115 --> 00:21:05.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a fascinating story
because we think of Will Smith.

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:06.746 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:21:06.746 --> 00:21:08.120 align:middle line:84%
When we think of
men in black, we

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.760 align:middle line:90%
think of the film version of it.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.050 align:middle line:84%
But the whole notion that you
have these little tiny-- again,

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.870 align:middle line:84%
little people who are--
they're wearing fedoras

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:18.160 align:middle line:84%
from the '40s-- they haven't
upped their act in terms

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.430 align:middle line:84%
of fashion-- that are shuffling
single file that show up

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:24.140 align:middle line:84%
and stare and people seem
to succumb to their will.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:27.606 align:middle line:84%
This again, another kind of
shadowy being that's coming in.

00:21:27.606 --> 00:21:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And no one quite
understands why.

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:30.289 align:middle line:90%
There's an intrinsic threat.

00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: They're not
ordinary human beings.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.680 align:middle line:90%
This is clear.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there's
an infrastructure of them.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:38.965 align:middle line:84%
I think that they just
live here-- I mean,

00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:41.340 align:middle line:84%
as odd as that might seem to
someone who's maybe watching

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.280 align:middle line:84%
this for the first time
thinking, what's this?

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And they come across
our conversation.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.940 align:middle line:10%
I think there is a lot of this.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.347 align:middle line:10%
I came across one other story.

00:21:50.347 --> 00:21:52.055 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to be
bludgeoning you with--

00:21:52.055 --> 00:21:52.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, do.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.105 align:middle line:90%
I love stories.

00:21:53.105 --> 00:21:56.360 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: A woman of--
extraordinarily level-headed

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.610 align:middle line:84%
woman I interviewed-- I was
in Iowa a number of years

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:03.250 align:middle line:84%
ago-- came up to me after a
lecture that I gave there.

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:04.800 align:middle line:90%
Very quiet, soft-spoken.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.130 align:middle line:10%
Very, let me say,
rational type of person.

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:09.780 align:middle line:84%
She has a master's
degree in engineering--

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.282 align:middle line:84%
in literature,
excuse me, but she

00:22:11.282 --> 00:22:12.740 align:middle line:84%
has an engineering
background also.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.850 align:middle line:84%
Very smart-- told
me of an encounter

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:21.370 align:middle line:84%
she had as a student in the
late '90s in England, in the UK.

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Western England
and Wales-- she'd

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.020 align:middle line:84%
spent time in both
of those places.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:31.700 align:middle line:84%
She boarded a train on
her way to Swansea, Wales.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.422 align:middle line:90%
And she got on.

00:22:33.422 --> 00:22:35.241 align:middle line:84%
She got on as early as
Stratford upon Avon.

00:22:35.241 --> 00:22:36.240 align:middle line:90%
And she's on this train.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.910 align:middle line:84%
She gets on, and there are
these-- totally crowded train

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:42.820 align:middle line:84%
car, I mean, packed
like sardines.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.610 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't see an open seat
and she finally sees one,

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:46.980 align:middle line:90%
so she sits there.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And she's finding
herself sitting next to--

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:51.280 align:middle line:90%
with these very bizarre people.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.230 align:middle line:84%
One is a woman who's got this
head scarf and sunglasses

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.000 align:middle line:90%
and gloves.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And this woman, her name was
Lisa-- Midwestern US girl.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.155 align:middle line:90%
Says oh, hello, very politely.

00:23:05.155 --> 00:23:09.620 align:middle line:84%
The woman-- oh, she didn't have
sunglasses, she had eyeglasses.

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:14.580 align:middle line:84%
She looks at her with these
bright large eyes, apparently.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.813 align:middle line:84%
And she looks at her--
stares, says nothing,

00:23:16.813 --> 00:23:21.400 align:middle line:90%
and then says, ohhh.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.510 align:middle line:90%
Like, what does that mean?

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.010 align:middle line:84%
So there was a seat
across from her,

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:28.480 align:middle line:84%
which was actually empty but
filled with stuff belonging

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:32.360 align:middle line:84%
to this woman, who's diagonal
to her, who was equally strange.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.360 align:middle line:84%
This woman here was like
a blond Nordic type.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.600 align:middle line:90%
This woman had dark, curly hair.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And during their
little brief encounter,

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:44.530 align:middle line:84%
this other woman's leaning
forward-- who does this?

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Leaning forward, very
super-attentive--

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.800 align:middle line:84%
this is surreal-- listening
carefully to everything

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.300 align:middle line:90%
that they're talking about.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:56.030 align:middle line:84%
She also had these
very bizarre eyes.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:59.460 align:middle line:84%
So incidentally, the
woman who spoke to her--

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:01.980 align:middle line:84%
they had a little bit of a
very brief conversation--

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:05.615 align:middle line:84%
spoke to her in an exact
central Iowan accent.

00:24:05.615 --> 00:24:07.940 align:middle line:84%
But here they're
in western England.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.330 align:middle line:84%
She's from Iowa, but you'd think
that this is a corn-fed Iowa

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:12.630 align:middle line:90%
girl here as well.

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:13.654 align:middle line:90%
Little odd.

00:24:13.654 --> 00:24:15.070 align:middle line:84%
She looks around
the train and she

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:17.960 align:middle line:84%
sees these other
people-- odd people.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a man maybe
10 feet away from her,

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:22.442 align:middle line:90%
eight feet away from her.

00:24:22.442 --> 00:24:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And she's looking at him and she
said-- and I have to emphasize,

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:27.610 align:middle line:90%
this woman was not on drugs.

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:28.359 align:middle line:90%
She was not drunk.

00:24:28.359 --> 00:24:32.470 align:middle line:84%
She was not-- she's very--
I mean, having met her,

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:35.400 align:middle line:84%
I have to say she's very,
very straightforward.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.464 align:middle line:84%
She said this man, his
index finger was unraveling.

00:24:39.464 --> 00:24:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
what do you mean

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.970 align:middle line:90%
his index finger was unraveling?

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like the
digits were starting to--

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.665 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: She said,
it was not a glove.

00:24:47.665 --> 00:24:49.540 align:middle line:90%
The man's finger was unraveling.

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.822 align:middle line:84%
It was like-- it was
not like medical suture.

00:24:51.822 --> 00:24:53.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It was like pixels.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: It was thread,
fine thread, and silk.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:01.790 align:middle line:84%
She basically said he was
wearing like a human suit.

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And she looked around
and she concluded--

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:08.780 align:middle line:90%
and she got very panicky.

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.147 align:middle line:84%
And she had emphasized
this many times to me

00:25:11.147 --> 00:25:11.980 align:middle line:90%
in the conversation.

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.070 align:middle line:84%
She said, look, I
realize you might

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:16.425 align:middle line:84%
think I was a young
college student.

00:25:16.425 --> 00:25:17.800 align:middle line:84%
I might have gotten
very nervous.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.110 align:middle line:90%
She said, that was not the case.

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:22.820 align:middle line:84%
She was just hypervigilant
and noticing.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.090 align:middle line:10%
There were other
individuals that

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:28.100 align:middle line:10%
also were getting her attention.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:32.909 align:middle line:10%
So the man whose finger was
unraveling, at the very next

00:25:32.909 --> 00:25:35.200 align:middle line:10%
stop-- she was ready to get
off at her stop very early,

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.350 align:middle line:10%
no matter how far she
was from her destination.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.330 align:middle line:84%
But instead, he beat
her to the punch.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:43.070 align:middle line:84%
He got up and got out of
the train, off the train.

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And as he goes off the train, on
the platform, he stared at her,

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.550 align:middle line:90%
she said, through the window.

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And the two women
that she was with

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:53.320 align:middle line:90%
were looking intently at him.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And the woman next to
her put up her newspaper,

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.910 align:middle line:84%
blocking this woman,
Lisa's view from her,

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:01.000 align:middle line:84%
where she was evidently
communicating something

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.630 align:middle line:90%
to the man.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:03.250 align:middle line:90%
Very strange.

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:08.294 align:middle line:84%
So then-- this is like
out of a crazy movie.

00:26:08.294 --> 00:26:09.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Like "They
Live" or something.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Right.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:15.650 align:middle line:84%
So I think I'm missing part
of it, but the very end of it

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:18.780 align:middle line:90%
was the most bizarre.

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.464 align:middle line:84%
She was feeling a little more
at ease, for whatever reason.

00:26:21.464 --> 00:26:22.380 align:middle line:90%
She had felt nauseous.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:23.046 align:middle line:90%
She'd felt sick.

00:26:23.046 --> 00:26:25.500 align:middle line:84%
She'd felt dizzy for awhile,
but then she recovered.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And at one moment at
the next-- at one stop,

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:34.600 align:middle line:84%
everyone, 30 to 40
people, stood up,

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:40.540 align:middle line:84%
she said, absolutely in unison,
together-- every single person.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.150 align:middle line:84%
There were two people that she
knew were absolutely, totally

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:45.150 align:middle line:84%
human, a young guy
and a woman who

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:47.920 align:middle line:90%
was with him, maybe around 30.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Kind of ordinary-looking
guy and gal.

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:54.310 align:middle line:84%
She realized they
were the chaperones.

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And she said within
moments, all 30 to 40

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:02.890 align:middle line:84%
of these people, no noise,
no jostling, nothing,

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:05.280 align:middle line:90%
up, out, out of the car.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing she knew
she was absolutely alone.

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What a
creepy train ride.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: So there's
one follow-up

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.901 align:middle line:84%
to this story, which is
simply that she went back

00:27:12.901 --> 00:27:14.210 align:middle line:90%
to her college.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:17.410 align:middle line:84%
She met up with one of her
friends who was, I think,

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:18.710 align:middle line:90%
local to that area.

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And she told him what
she had encountered.

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:24.542 align:middle line:84%
And he said, apparently,
yes, I have heard.

00:27:24.542 --> 00:27:25.500 align:middle line:90%
He took this in stride.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:30.070 align:middle line:84%
He said, I've heard of a new
community, a newish community

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:32.970 align:middle line:84%
that sprung up somewhere
not far from here

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:35.110 align:middle line:84%
where they're
totally closed off.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:36.650 align:middle line:90%
They don't answer their doors.

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:38.370 align:middle line:90%
They just stay to themselves.

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:40.590 align:middle line:84%
But the problem with
this is, though, I mean,

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:42.990 align:middle line:90%
I asked her where was this?

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:44.900 align:middle line:90%
And it was frustrating to her.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.750 align:middle line:84%
She did not know what
stop they got off at.

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:48.600 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't remember.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.620 align:middle line:84%
I think part of it was that
she felt like her mind was

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.569 align:middle line:90%
almost intentionally made foggy.

00:27:53.569 --> 00:27:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And one does hear
this type of thing.

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, repeatedly.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: So she was a
little bit out of it

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:59.967 align:middle line:84%
during-- She didn't even notice
the two women in her booth

00:27:59.967 --> 00:28:01.341 align:middle line:84%
get up and leave
in front of her.

00:28:01.341 --> 00:28:03.140 align:middle line:10%
She said, I actually
didn't even realize

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.181 align:middle line:10%
until I was alone that,
oh my God, they all left.

00:28:05.181 --> 00:28:07.050 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even see them go.

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:08.045 align:middle line:90%
Very strange.

00:28:08.045 --> 00:28:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And she was never really able to
find out-- like, confirm this.

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And I've not been able to
find any kind of confirmation

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.520 align:middle line:90%
of such a town.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.630 align:middle line:90%
There you have it.

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:15.240 align:middle line:90%
Just another bizarre story.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just another one.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.568 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, one of
the things I found,

00:28:17.568 --> 00:28:20.210 align:middle line:84%
this was-- it's a
slight non-sequitur.

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:22.380 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's
talking about beings,

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.570 align:middle line:84%
other-dimensional beings that
are interfacing with humanity

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:27.360 align:middle line:84%
that I had not
heard about before.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.530 align:middle line:90%
This one was kind of cool.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:31.710 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to a
military remote viewer.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, what are
you guys seeing these days?

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:37.420 align:middle line:84%
I said, I know what you're
looking at as far as targets,

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.890 align:middle line:84%
but what are you seeing that
you guys can't talk about?

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Always a good question.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And he said,
well, what we're seeing,

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:50.580 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing these beings in--
they're just slightly phased

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.275 align:middle line:90%
off, but they're elephantine.

00:28:52.275 --> 00:28:55.370 align:middle line:90%


00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:56.530 align:middle line:90%
And I said, really?

00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:57.210 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, no.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:59.321 align:middle line:90%
This is benevolent.

00:28:59.321 --> 00:29:00.695 align:middle line:84%
This presence is
very benevolent.

00:29:00.695 --> 00:29:02.460 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, hold on a minute.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.484 align:middle line:84%
If you look to Hindu lore,
then you're talking--

00:29:04.484 --> 00:29:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Ganesh.

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Ganesh, the
remover of obstacles.

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:09.407 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, isn't
that interesting.

00:29:09.407 --> 00:29:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And so when you start
hearing these stories coming

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:13.990 align:middle line:84%
from unexpected
quarters, you can

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:16.784 align:middle line:84%
start seeing where a lot
of the world's religions

00:29:16.784 --> 00:29:19.075 align:middle line:84%
and traditions have come
because these beings obviously

00:29:19.075 --> 00:29:19.870 align:middle line:90%
have been here a long time.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:22.286 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: What's interesting
is, at the end of the workshop

00:29:22.286 --> 00:29:24.890 align:middle line:84%
that I led today, that was
one of my final thoughts

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and speculations
about, we're talking

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.440 align:middle line:90%
about these ancient religions.

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And many people had accounts
of-- their encounters

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:34.980 align:middle line:84%
with dimensional
types of entities.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:38.060 align:middle line:90%
This is widespread.

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:41.070 align:middle line:84%
This is something that, years
ago, I really stayed away from.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:44.800 align:middle line:10%
And I still have-- I'm still
very cautious about some

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.209 align:middle line:10%
of these encounters
and these stories.

00:29:47.209 --> 00:29:48.750 align:middle line:84%
But I must say,
there's many of them.

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And a large number of these
people I spoke with, quite

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:55.510 align:middle line:84%
a few today, these
are not just people

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.790 align:middle line:84%
that do tarot card
reading for a living.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:59.250 align:middle line:10%
Not to diminish
that, but these are

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:00.900 align:middle line:10%
people who are lawyers
and accountants.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And they have all kinds
of very professional jobs.

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:05.330 align:middle line:90%
And they have such encounters.

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Give us
an idea of what

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.830 align:middle line:84%
you see in terms of the
recognition of these encounters

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:14.670 align:middle line:84%
starting to come to the
forefront and the opportunity

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:17.209 align:middle line:90%
for humankind in general.

00:30:17.209 --> 00:30:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: It's a great question.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:24.050 align:middle line:84%
I think what we're seeing
is that there is a reality.

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:26.780 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly not acknowledged
by the officially sanctioned

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:28.910 align:middle line:84%
narrative that we're
all supposed to believe.

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:30.400 align:middle line:90%
There's this thing happening.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.737 align:middle line:10%
There are these other
people, beings-- whatever

00:30:32.737 --> 00:30:34.570 align:middle line:10%
they are-- these other
beings that are here.

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And they either live here or
they're here for the long term.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And they're interacting
with us in various ways,

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.690 align:middle line:90%
to varying degrees.

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Some of them seem to prefer not
to interact with us very much.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.242 align:middle line:84%
Others-- which we didn't really
get a chance to talk about,

00:30:47.242 --> 00:30:48.950 align:middle line:84%
but there are many
encounters with people

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:53.690 align:middle line:84%
who've had beings to
communicate things with them

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:57.270 align:middle line:84%
in one way or another,
often very positive.

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By no means is
it all negative or scary.

00:30:59.420 --> 00:30:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: No.

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:00.988 align:middle line:84%
You have the
encounters that people

00:31:00.988 --> 00:31:03.915 align:middle line:84%
have with the so-called
grays, which are not always

00:31:03.915 --> 00:31:06.040 align:middle line:84%
perceived as positive and
can be very intimidating.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.400 align:middle line:90%
But you get a wide range.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.659 align:middle line:84%
What I think is happening
is that humanity right now--

00:31:09.659 --> 00:31:11.575 align:middle line:84%
I think we've always
been subject of interest.

00:31:11.575 --> 00:31:12.922 align:middle line:90%
I think we're interesting.

00:31:12.922 --> 00:31:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think that other
entities that have the ability

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:17.880 align:middle line:84%
to watch us have been doing
so for a very long time.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.635 align:middle line:84%
But I also think
that right now we

00:31:19.635 --> 00:31:22.100 align:middle line:84%
are at a particular
moment in our history

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:25.890 align:middle line:84%
and in our civilization where
we're developing capabilities,

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:27.834 align:middle line:90%
certainly technologically.

00:31:27.834 --> 00:31:29.750 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do is
look at the last century,

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:31.999 align:middle line:84%
where we were at 100 years
ago and where we're at now.

00:31:31.999 --> 00:31:32.790 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's not a
long period of time.

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.700 align:middle line:84%
Where will we be
in another century?

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:37.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And another thing
that strikes me

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:42.640 align:middle line:84%
is if the science behind the
notion that the Earth is just--

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.520 align:middle line:84%
is going through this
sub-dimensional density shift,

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:49.550 align:middle line:84%
if that is true, and
there seems to be-- we

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:51.420 align:middle line:84%
can go on about
that-- then it would

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:55.520 align:middle line:84%
seem that we should be
able to start having more

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.190 align:middle line:84%
direct contact
with beings who've

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:00.310 align:middle line:84%
been just slightly phased off,
just like many people can see

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:02.584 align:middle line:84%
ships sitting right
here over here.

00:32:02.584 --> 00:32:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: This is
a different angle

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.802 align:middle line:84%
than what I was--
but I'm not disputing

00:32:05.802 --> 00:32:06.760 align:middle line:90%
that this is a problem.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm bringing it
in as a different angle.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.050 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: Absolutely.

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:11.190 align:middle line:84%
I think that they're
interested in us

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:12.731 align:middle line:84%
because we're about,
technologically,

00:32:12.731 --> 00:32:15.160 align:middle line:84%
to go into some advanced
quantum computing, advanced AI,

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.864 align:middle line:84%
advanced nanotech,
advanced 3D printing,

00:32:16.864 --> 00:32:17.780 align:middle line:90%
which will be organic.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:21.210 align:middle line:84%
We're about to enter their
world on a technological basis,

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:22.200 align:middle line:90%
probably.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.300 align:middle line:84%
But now what you're
talking about

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.479 align:middle line:84%
is-- this is a valid
way to look at it.

00:32:26.479 --> 00:32:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And again, I would have had
a harder time 10 years ago,

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:30.560 align:middle line:90%
but you know what?

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.280 align:middle line:90%
Remote viewing is real.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.330 align:middle line:90%
That's real.

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:35.610 align:middle line:84%
There's a dimension of
reality that the human mind

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:39.041 align:middle line:84%
is able to comprehend that
is beyond the mere-- what

00:32:39.041 --> 00:32:40.040 align:middle line:90%
we perceive as physical.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.123 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The five senses.

00:32:41.123 --> 00:32:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>>DOLAN: So that's real.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.349 align:middle line:84%
And I happen to think that
they-- because I think many

00:32:45.349 --> 00:32:47.223 align:middle line:84%
of them communicate
intensely telepathically,

00:32:47.223 --> 00:32:52.050 align:middle line:84%
so that-- whereas I think
that all people have

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:53.580 align:middle line:90%
some of this ability.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:57.780 align:middle line:84%
I suspect that some may be
very gifted, like music,

00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:01.970 align:middle line:84%
like anything, and that they
may very well have a stronger

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:05.120 align:middle line:84%
interest in some of those types
of people-- individuals who

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:08.800 align:middle line:84%
exhibit greater psychic or
telepathic or unusual types

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.450 align:middle line:84%
of abilities like that probably
would be of interest to them.

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:13.783 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's creating an
interesting portrait, though,

00:33:13.783 --> 00:33:17.060 align:middle line:84%
no matter what
quarter it comes from.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:19.670 align:middle line:10%
>>DOLAN: The one thing that
I've often wondered about

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:21.780 align:middle line:10%
is will we ever get
to a point where A,

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.000 align:middle line:10%
we're going to get to an open
acknowledgement of them here.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.750 align:middle line:90%
This is a problem of disclosure.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:29.910 align:middle line:84%
That is, it's one thing
to admit, oh yeah,

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:31.744 align:middle line:84%
there are these craft
that zip around.

00:33:31.744 --> 00:33:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And they're not all
black budget people.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:35.743 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, we don't really
know where they come from.

00:33:35.743 --> 00:33:37.260 align:middle line:90%
That's a problem right there.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.562 align:middle line:84%
That's a big problem,
politically, to deal with.

00:33:39.562 --> 00:33:41.895 align:middle line:84%
It's a big problem in terms
of our energy infrastructure

00:33:41.895 --> 00:33:42.510 align:middle line:90%
to deal with.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:44.340 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a
big problem to deal

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.210 align:middle line:90%
with in terms of many people--

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Having beautiful
blonde people show up

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:48.912 align:middle line:84%
in your church on
a Sunday, tune in,

00:33:48.912 --> 00:33:49.960 align:middle line:84%
and getting in your
head telepathically.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: How do
we deal with them?

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:57.012 align:middle line:84%
How do we-- I've often felt
that that moment, once it

00:33:57.012 --> 00:33:58.720 align:middle line:84%
starts sinking into
people that there are

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:02.090 align:middle line:84%
these other kinds of beings
here, very intensely, probably

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:06.000 align:middle line:84%
intelligent and advanced beings
in certain ways, one thing

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.340 align:middle line:84%
that I hope is
that it would spark

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.159 align:middle line:84%
a kind of philosophical
reflection

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:13.489 align:middle line:84%
on the part of humanity, on
the part of ordinary people,

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:16.715 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of, gee, what
have I been doing with my life?

00:34:16.715 --> 00:34:19.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to watch "Wheel of
Fortune" again another night

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:20.548 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to
play internet games

00:34:20.548 --> 00:34:22.440 align:middle line:84%
and play solitaire
on my computer?

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.969 align:middle line:84%
Or am I actually
going to realize

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:28.730 align:middle line:84%
that there are higher
levels of thinking,

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:31.534 align:middle line:84%
better outcomes for
myself, personally.

00:34:31.534 --> 00:34:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And I can maybe step up
my game, because there

00:34:33.450 --> 00:34:34.909 align:middle line:90%
are these other beings here.

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:37.954 align:middle line:84%
And they've obviously--
they're at a level--

00:34:37.954 --> 00:34:39.995 align:middle line:84%
I would like to think that
this is a possibility.

00:34:39.995 --> 00:34:42.139 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's hope.

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:43.580 align:middle line:90%
So any final thoughts?

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.723 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I think
we're about out of time.

00:34:45.723 --> 00:34:47.389 align:middle line:84%
>>DOLAN: Well, I guess
I consider myself

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:48.870 align:middle line:90%
the luckiest person that I know.

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:52.391 align:middle line:84%
I get to study a
subject that I think

00:34:52.391 --> 00:34:54.390 align:middle line:84%
is the most fascinating
thing in the world, that

00:34:54.390 --> 00:34:57.240 align:middle line:84%
is the entire gamut
of the UFO subject

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:01.862 align:middle line:84%
brings us into every-- it's
the most cutting-edge subject.

00:35:01.862 --> 00:35:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Whether we're talking
about politics or science

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:10.220 align:middle line:84%
or human encounters, technology,
it encompasses all of that.

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's a reality
that will not go away.

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:14.670 align:middle line:84%
It can be denied
for only so long.

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And we are right on
the cusp of, I feel,

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:20.860 align:middle line:84%
we are on the cusp of a
very significant shift

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:21.930 align:middle line:90%
in our civilization.

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:23.940 align:middle line:84%
I use that word--
that's a loaded word,

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:28.000 align:middle line:84%
but I think it is a change
that we're going to see.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's not necessarily all
going to be a better change.

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:32.877 align:middle line:90%
We're looking at a battle.

00:35:32.877 --> 00:35:34.460 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at the
battle on the one

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:36.940 align:middle line:84%
hand of our human
handlers, who really

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:40.040 align:middle line:84%
do want to create a global
totalitarian society.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.050 align:middle line:10%
And maybe they'll do it.

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:44.510 align:middle line:10%
But on the other hand,
are us and everyone

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:47.360 align:middle line:10%
who's watching this, who,
we only want one thing.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.490 align:middle line:10%
We want freedom.

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:50.510 align:middle line:10%
We're like water
going to the source.

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:53.030 align:middle line:10%
And we try to find our
ways of attaining it.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:54.690 align:middle line:90%
And we have our own tools.

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:56.850 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability to
communicate with each other.

00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:59.000 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability-- some
people, brave people who

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.050 align:middle line:84%
take digital data,
classified data,

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and they throw it
out for the world.

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:05.610 align:middle line:90%
And that's the battle.

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And part of that
information concerns

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.690 align:middle line:84%
what we've been
talking about here.

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:14.990 align:middle line:84%
I believe that humanity--
not the evil ones,

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:17.314 align:middle line:84%
but the good people-- that
we're going to end up-- I

00:36:17.314 --> 00:36:17.980 align:middle line:90%
think we'll win.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
we will have access

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:23.090 align:middle line:84%
to freer forms of energy,
better forms of energy.

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think we will
have the opportunity

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:28.100 align:middle line:84%
to create a genuinely
viable human civilization.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I agree
with you, Richard.

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.550 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.
