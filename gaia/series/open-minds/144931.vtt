00:00:28.052 --> 00:00:30.260 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MERIDITH: HeatherAsh
Amara, like many of us,

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.210 align:middle line:10%
felt the need to
return to nature

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.890 align:middle line:10%
and delved into
European shamanism

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.020 align:middle line:10%
to create her own
brand of feminism.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Her book "Warrior
Goddess Training"

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.400 align:middle line:84%
takes people through
a step-by-step process

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.710 align:middle line:84%
to connecting with
one's deeper femininity.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.650 align:middle line:84%
But before we go to the
step-by-step part of this,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.910 align:middle line:84%
I thought we would have a
larger, broader conversation.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Because I think
that times really

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.350 align:middle line:84%
require to go into depth
on the conversation

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.170 align:middle line:84%
about what's happening
with the feminine

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.840 align:middle line:84%
at this period in history,
And not just here,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.080 align:middle line:90%
but also globally.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And the good news is you came
back relatively recently,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.990 align:middle line:84%
a few months ago, a
couple of months ago,

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.870 align:middle line:84%
from India and Bali where you
spent a fair amount of time

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.240 align:middle line:84%
in an ashram with
Amma, the hugging Amma.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.790 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of Ammas,
but the hugging Amma,

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.770 align:middle line:84%
which I think some of our
viewers may be familiar with.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.250 align:middle line:84%
So I think first of all
I wanted to find out

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.150 align:middle line:84%
about the notion of ashram
life these days, because so

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.910 align:middle line:84%
many people are so overwhelmed
that the notion of just putting

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.950 align:middle line:84%
it all aside, giving
up their apartment

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.086 align:middle line:84%
and heading to India
to live in an ashram

00:01:36.086 --> 00:01:37.460 align:middle line:84%
is starting to
sound really good.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.390 align:middle line:84%
But there are
responsibilities with it.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.059 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk about
ashram life a bit.

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>HEATHERASH AMARA: Absolutely.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.420 align:middle line:10%
And that was
definitely my desire

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.160 align:middle line:10%
was I wanted to go
someplace where there

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.529 align:middle line:10%
was a container already set
that I didn't have to think,

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:50.570 align:middle line:10%
that I didn't have to
figure out what I was going

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.510 align:middle line:10%
to do every day, and to
just be able to rest,

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.540 align:middle line:10%
to really let
myself settle into.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.265 align:middle line:84%
And there are responsibilities
for being there as well.

00:01:59.265 --> 00:02:01.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like I'm just
going to go kick back and drink

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.680 align:middle line:90%
margaritas and be on the beach.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.370 align:middle line:84%
It's very much about
going inside and getting

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.300 align:middle line:84%
quiet and being part
of a huge community.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.640 align:middle line:84%
The ashram that I was out
there were 7,000 people there,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.889 align:middle line:90%
because it was over Christmas.

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:90%
So busy.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And so navigating that many
people and staying quiet

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.010 align:middle line:84%
is great, because
you really get to how

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.160 align:middle line:84%
do I find my center in
the middle of all of this.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And also to be in
service, because that's

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.730 align:middle line:84%
one of the main things
that we do at the ashram

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.950 align:middle line:90%
is that everybody gets a sava.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Everybody gets some task
that you're doing every day

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.080 align:middle line:90%
to give back to the community.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:90%
And I felt really blessed--

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What was your task?

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: I got to sweep.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.000 align:middle line:90%
I was one of the sweepers.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And so every morning I would get
up and use the broom and sweep

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.840 align:middle line:84%
the path and clean up bird poo
and get on the hands and knees

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.130 align:middle line:90%
and mop the floor.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.990 align:middle line:90%
And I loved it.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.890 align:middle line:90%
Totally loved it.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.931 align:middle line:84%
I have friends who were
like how did you do that?

00:03:02.931 --> 00:03:04.160 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't it really hard?

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.350 align:middle line:90%
No, it was great for me.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.200 align:middle line:84%
Because, again,
especially as a woman that

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.080 align:middle line:84%
has a lot of responsibility and
that is a leader of a community

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.920 align:middle line:84%
here, to be able to go
someplace and let all of that go

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.220 align:middle line:84%
and have nobody know who
I am and be in service

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.470 align:middle line:90%
was such a gift for me.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.290 align:middle line:90%
It was really, really beautiful.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do they still use
those lovely handmade brooms

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.380 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I love those.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.230 align:middle line:84%
I even I like watching
people sweep with them.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean I probably wouldn't
mind doing it myself.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.020 align:middle line:84%
But there is such a
graceful kind of way

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.190 align:middle line:84%
those brooms even
move, which is I always

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.460 align:middle line:84%
liked watching people when
they were sweeping in India.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.916 align:middle line:90%
It's just one of those things.

00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:49.915 align:middle line:90%
It was kind of hypnotic.

00:03:49.915 --> 00:03:51.800 align:middle line:84%
So I can understand
why you resonated

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.540 align:middle line:90%
with that particular chore.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.400 align:middle line:90%
So 7,000 people.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And then beyond that do you
have any other responsibility

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.600 align:middle line:84%
within the community besides
that particular chore

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.130 align:middle line:90%
that you're assigned?

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.450 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: There's the chore.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Then there's also, in this
case with this ashram,

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Amma would come out to stage
every day and do darshan.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that she asked

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.770 align:middle line:84%
is all the foreigners to
sit on the stage with her

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.149 align:middle line:90%
for 45 minutes.

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:18.709 align:middle line:84%
And so that was a
part of it, too,

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.529 align:middle line:84%
was when she was giving
meditation instructions

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.350 align:middle line:84%
at the beach to be
there, to be onstage

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.550 align:middle line:90%
when that was happening.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.137 align:middle line:84%
And besides that, it was
mostly then navigating

00:04:29.137 --> 00:04:31.470 align:middle line:84%
what did you want to create
for yourself during the day.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.830 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
spaciousness in that way.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.380 align:middle line:90%
And also a lot of distraction.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it was fun
navigating, meeting people,

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.502 align:middle line:84%
and also remembering
what am I here to do.

00:04:43.502 --> 00:04:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you in
a dorm setting or do

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:90%
you have more private rooms?

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: All in a dorm setting.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's why it's
hard to find the quiet time.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.059 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And usually there
were two to a room.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.641 align:middle line:84%
And there were four to a
room because of how busy

00:04:55.641 --> 00:04:57.735 align:middle line:90%
the ashram was during this time.

00:04:57.735 --> 00:04:58.610 align:middle line:90%
But I would navigate.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.830 align:middle line:84%
I would find-- and this is
true everywhere-- there's

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.480 align:middle line:90%
always places that are quiet.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.210 align:middle line:84%
There's always places that
we can settle into nature.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.574 align:middle line:84%
And so there was a
garden that I found

00:05:07.574 --> 00:05:09.740 align:middle line:84%
that I showed to my roommates
at the end of my stay.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And they were like, how,
where, how did you find this?

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, I just
listened and looked around

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.590 align:middle line:84%
and found this little spot
that hardly anybody knew about.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And then going to the beach
and hanging out with the nature

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.160 align:middle line:90%
there was really beautiful.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's such
a completely different pace

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.070 align:middle line:90%
of life, too.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.040 align:middle line:84%
I remember coming
back from India.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.200 align:middle line:84%
I was in Tiru and the
little quiet Amma is there.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And she is, I mean, I
think one of the most

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.370 align:middle line:84%
delightful creatures on
the planet in that she

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.840 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have a thing to say.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.780 align:middle line:84%
But her energy-- she's
been quiet for 30 years.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.130 align:middle line:84%
But when she comes out
into her little chair

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.390 align:middle line:84%
in her little ashram, there
is a type of power that

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.190 align:middle line:90%
hits the room that is palpable.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And she is only
there for 15 minutes.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And one time I thought
I'm going to open my eyes

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.760 align:middle line:90%
and see what she's up to.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And I watched what she was
doing around the room looking

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.280 align:middle line:84%
at how she would
parrot certain people.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And my son was there as well
on the other side of the room.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.620 align:middle line:90%
And he was doing the same thing.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And she noticed both
of us very quickly

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.490 align:middle line:84%
and sent an amazingly
powerful blast of energy

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.810 align:middle line:84%
that almost knocked us over, a
ball of energy, into our chest,

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.310 align:middle line:90%
with that same little smile.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.082 align:middle line:84%
You know just as
sweet as can be.

00:06:25.082 --> 00:06:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And that was really, to me,
the most delightful time.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
There was no
exchange of anything.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.770 align:middle line:84%
It was just energy
and you're left

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.650 align:middle line:84%
to make of the day and your
own thoughts what you wish.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:35.450 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.590 align:middle line:90%
That's really beautiful.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.951 align:middle line:84%
And I had a similar
experience with Amma.

00:06:40.951 --> 00:06:42.950 align:middle line:84%
I've never had a huge
experience when I hug her.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.737 align:middle line:84%
Some people will say these
great experiences they've had.

00:06:45.737 --> 00:06:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And I've been like, I just
like being around her energy.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.960 align:middle line:90%
Like, I love that.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.966 align:middle line:84%
So the third time I went up
to do darshan and get my hug--

00:06:52.966 --> 00:06:55.340 align:middle line:84%
the first time, I just went
for myself, the second time I

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.692 align:middle line:90%
went to say thank you to her.

00:06:56.692 --> 00:06:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And the third time I was in
line, I'm like what do I want--

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.720 align:middle line:90%
what's my focus for this time?

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And I realized I
want to open myself

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:09.169 align:middle line:84%
to take in this deep feminine
massive love that she holds.

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:11.210 align:middle line:84%
And I want to open to that
so I can bring it back

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.820 align:middle line:90%
to my community in the States.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And when I got the hug
from her that time,

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.840 align:middle line:84%
it was like that was the
right thing to ask for.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Because I could feel she
tuned in and just whoaw.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.070 align:middle line:90%
Here you go sweetheart.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.726 align:middle line:90%
So that was a huge gift.

00:07:24.726 --> 00:07:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's wonderful.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And on that subject,
I flashback to what

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.010 align:middle line:84%
it was like returning
from India through London.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.670 align:middle line:84%
I had things to do
in London for awhile.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.824 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of
like everybody.

00:07:36.824 --> 00:07:38.490 align:middle line:84%
Once you've been there
for a little bit,

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.980 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to put
Western clothes on.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.360 align:middle line:84%
You love all the
beautiful color.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And again, I want to go
back to this in a moment.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.640 align:middle line:84%
In Tiru on that
side of the country,

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.160 align:middle line:84%
the women are still in
traditional clothing.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.260 align:middle line:84%
They don't wear
Western clothing.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:58.700 align:middle line:84%
And the sway of the silk and
the colors wafting in the wind.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, women sweeping
with their wedding bangles on.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:84%
There is this feminine
beauty that personally, I

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.640 align:middle line:84%
haven't experienced anywhere
else on the planet in that way.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.390 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
couple that with what's

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.848 align:middle line:84%
really going on on
the ground, too,

00:08:12.848 --> 00:08:15.110 align:middle line:84%
because there are two
different stories going on.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:20.720 align:middle line:84%
But then coming back into
London where the men are gray,

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.950 align:middle line:84%
with gray clothing and
black clothing, bustling by.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Won't even help you with a
bag if you're struggling.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Just kind of pushing
by you in such a hurry,

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.370 align:middle line:84%
was an assault in the way
of going from the feminine

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:35.897 align:middle line:90%
to the masculine.

00:08:35.897 --> 00:08:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And so can you comment
on this a little bit?

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Because you were away
for awhile and had

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:44.570 align:middle line:84%
to come back to Western,
more masculinized reality.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And it definitely
is a transition.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And the sense of as I went
from India to Bali where

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.477 align:middle line:84%
people's hearts are
so open, hugely open,

00:08:54.477 --> 00:08:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and that was the thing I
noticed the most of coming back

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.910 align:middle line:84%
to the States is
like there's hardly

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.700 align:middle line:84%
anybody here who wanders
around with their heart open.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are so armored and
so protective and so busy.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:09.610 align:middle line:84%
So I felt a deep longing of
like can I just go back to Bali?

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And that focus-- what
I call that warrior,

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:18.960 align:middle line:84%
we're getting things done,
extreme warrior energy.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And so it's always
an adjustment.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.130 align:middle line:84%
Because I do feel
like the feminine,

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.040 align:middle line:84%
that energy is so much
about flow, and beauty,

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.750 align:middle line:90%
and bringing that forward.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And so it made me even
more dedicated to bringing

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.440 align:middle line:84%
like how do I anchor that in
my being so strongly so I don't

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.435 align:middle line:84%
get pulled back into
quick we have to rush

00:09:36.435 --> 00:09:37.910 align:middle line:84%
and we have to
make things happen.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:43.340 align:middle line:84%
How do I bring that back and
stay connected to that energy

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.450 align:middle line:90%
and to that wisdom?

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it is
a double-edged sword.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.800 align:middle line:90%
And this is something--

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean we're having
a larger conversation

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.880 align:middle line:90%
about the feminine today.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And we are at a very
interesting, and also

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.820 align:middle line:84%
powerful and delicate,
point in history.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Because when we
look at these women

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.260 align:middle line:84%
with their openheartedness,
also there's

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.700 align:middle line:90%
a lot of pain behind it.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.440 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of abuse.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.570 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of spousal abuse.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.260 align:middle line:84%
This is pretty
typical, actually.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:11.450 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then to
go in the afternoons

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.420 align:middle line:84%
to satsang, or whatever, and
to kind of release yourself

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.160 align:middle line:84%
of your guilt as a
man and go back and do

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.260 align:middle line:84%
the same practices the
next day against the family

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.280 align:middle line:90%
and the wife.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.570 align:middle line:90%
This is a very--

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.560 align:middle line:84%
and yet we're going
to these places

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.570 align:middle line:90%
seeking spiritual upliftment.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.019 align:middle line:84%
This is one bone I do
have to pick about it.

00:10:30.019 --> 00:10:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Now if you're going
to an ashram that

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.870 align:middle line:84%
has a very high level
of consciousness, that

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:84%
exists with all the people that
are coming and participating,

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.260 align:middle line:90%
you're in a bubble.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.190 align:middle line:84%
But when you go into the
countryside at large,

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.590 align:middle line:84%
it may look colorful and
feminine and beautiful,

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.690 align:middle line:84%
but that is not the reality
of what's happening.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes, that is very--

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:49.009 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so you kind of
have to separate those two out.

00:10:49.009 --> 00:10:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And the same in Bali, the same
in many, many other third world

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.660 align:middle line:84%
nations although
they're coming along.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:57.240 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at this notion--

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.340 align:middle line:84%
and then we're going
to switch to the West--

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:05.520 align:middle line:84%
of how you would even
begin to embody that.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And then begin expressing
it in a meaningful way when

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:09.600 align:middle line:90%
you return home.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.240 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:16.170 align:middle line:84%
There is so much trauma still
being perpetrated and held

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.960 align:middle line:84%
in all countries, but especially
in developing nations.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.070 align:middle line:90%
It's so rough.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And especially India is
one of the worst, really.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:23.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:25.960 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: One of the
most, most challenging.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.642 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned from
being there this time--

00:11:29.642 --> 00:11:31.100 align:middle line:84%
because I've been
there many times.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think most people
that have been to India

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.580 align:middle line:84%
have total love-hate
relationship with it.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.027 align:middle line:84%
Like you love it
and you hate it.

00:11:36.027 --> 00:11:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Because it's one of
the most difficult

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:38.910 align:middle line:90%
places to be on the planet.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:39.710 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.660 align:middle line:90%
It's such a contradiction.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's also a great place to
learn how to hold all of it.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:51.140 align:middle line:84%
How to open enough to hold the
incredible beauty of the women

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and that the grace
that they have

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.260 align:middle line:84%
and the femininity
that just comes out,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and also the worship
of the feminine,

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.360 align:middle line:84%
like how much the goddess
is really honored there,

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.350 align:middle line:90%
and to hold that.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And not to ignore or press away
the fact that there are still

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:14.420 align:middle line:84%
a lot of abuse and trauma,
and misogyny that's happening.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:15.440 align:middle line:90%
And how to hold that.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.882 align:middle line:84%
And that's the skill I
feel like we all need.

00:12:17.882 --> 00:12:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Because the temptation is
I just want to pretend this

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.450 align:middle line:90%
isn't happening.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So I can just love this
part but then we split.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:25.730 align:middle line:90%
And we're not being honest.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're cutting that part
of ourself off as well.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:34.160 align:middle line:84%
And so that practice of how do
I hold this incredible dichotomy

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.030 align:middle line:84%
that's painful in
such a way that I'm

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:41.234 align:middle line:84%
able to embrace all of it and
stay steady in the center,

00:12:41.234 --> 00:12:42.275 align:middle line:90%
and that was my practice.

00:12:42.275 --> 00:12:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Like how do I stay steady
with what's happening?

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.170 align:middle line:90%
All of it.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's challenging.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
get to practice.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.740 align:middle line:84%
We have lots of
opportunity for practice.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of course.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Let's switch the lens
over to the Western world

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and the United
States in particular.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:06.320 align:middle line:84%
So over the last
30 years, as women

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.400 align:middle line:84%
have been able to take
on more responsibility,

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.570 align:middle line:84%
spend less time at home,
less time with the kids,

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:14.390 align:middle line:84%
less time with the
husband, more time at work,

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:19.070 align:middle line:84%
more time developing competitive
masculine traits in general,

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.930 align:middle line:84%
we've fairly well
accomplished that.

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And I mean you got
to keep thinking back

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:28.040 align:middle line:84%
to coming back with these lovely
soft cotton and silk things

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:32.540 align:middle line:84%
on and arriving at the airport
like a typical want-to-be

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.240 align:middle line:90%
American with the Indian garb.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And then shoving, shoehorning,
myself into a pair

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.060 align:middle line:90%
of jeans the next day, right?

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And the horrible feeling of
that fabric against the skin.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:47.270 align:middle line:84%
The constriction of
it, the total lack

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:50.330 align:middle line:84%
of femininity in wearing
jeans, for example.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And yet that has become
a utilitarian uniform

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.780 align:middle line:90%
in the Western world.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:00.200 align:middle line:84%
I would even go so far as
to say there's probably--

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.300 align:middle line:84%
because I can tend to
go that way anyway--

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:07.040 align:middle line:84%
perhaps even a conspiracy around
it to create gender neutrality.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.820 align:middle line:90%
And it's worked really well.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:09.620 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.270 align:middle line:90%
We're stuffed in jeans.

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:14.690 align:middle line:84%
We wear that same
clothing men wear.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:15.950 align:middle line:90%
We're competing for jobs.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.350 align:middle line:84%
We're competing for
places out of college.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.200 align:middle line:84%
So now let's look at
that as contrasted

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:26.240 align:middle line:84%
to the other and your perception
of the net effect of that

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.000 align:middle line:90%
on society now and on men.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And how you would choose
to begin working with that

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:34.040 align:middle line:90%
and bridging it?

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Beautiful.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.620 align:middle line:90%
Great question.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Well one thing I look at
the big picture of where

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:43.970 align:middle line:84%
we are right now in terms
of women's empowerment

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:47.810 align:middle line:84%
and the feminist movement and
relationship with men and work

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:52.830 align:middle line:84%
is that just 100 years
ago or 200 years ago,

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:55.070 align:middle line:90%
women had almost no freedom.

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:56.750 align:middle line:90%
We had no external freedom.

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.070 align:middle line:90%
And now we have a lot.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.320 align:middle line:84%
We can have pretty much
whatever job we want.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.100 align:middle line:84%
We can partner with
who we want to.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:02.900 align:middle line:90%
We can vote.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.250 align:middle line:90%
Yea.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And yet, a lot of women
aren't free on the inside.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.480 align:middle line:84%
We still are
comparing ourselves.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.930 align:middle line:84%
We're still putting ourselves
in these little boxes.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And there was a phase
where women went

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:19.110 align:middle line:90%
through becoming more like men.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And this happens
with all peoples--

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.450 align:middle line:84%
where there's a
disparity in the power

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.310 align:middle line:84%
is that there's
always a phase that

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:30.390 align:middle line:84%
happens where the people that
are oppressed, we can say,

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:33.180 align:middle line:84%
take on the traits of the people
that have power because that's

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.260 align:middle line:90%
the only way in.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.020 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way there's
going to be any respect.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.470 align:middle line:90%
And so that's a phase.

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're starting to
come out of that phase.

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:43.650 align:middle line:90%
Yea.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:44.940 align:middle line:90%
Which is exciting.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Where women are starting--
and I hear this all the time--

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.186 align:middle line:84%
women are starting
to say, I don't

00:15:48.186 --> 00:15:52.170 align:middle line:84%
want to be something that's
not who I actually am.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And we're starting to realize
that we've put ourselves

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.990 align:middle line:84%
in these boxes in
order to get through.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:00.960 align:middle line:84%
But we're not expressing are
our authentic self or our

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.347 align:middle line:90%
how we want to be in the world.

00:16:02.347 --> 00:16:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well we're now going
into the second and third

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.680 align:middle line:84%
generation away
from classic kind

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.440 align:middle line:84%
of feminine
responsibility/traits.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.330 align:middle line:84%
But again, the
benefit upside of it

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.310 align:middle line:84%
is exactly everything
you spoke about.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And now how do you how do
you begin reintegrating what

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.020 align:middle line:90%
does the new society look like?

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Because then we have to look
at the men's side of it.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.350 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Absolutely.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And we've been in this
power dynamic of power over.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.430 align:middle line:84%
If you have more resources
and more money and more stuff,

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:90%
then you have power.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And the shift, the
paradigm shift,

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.820 align:middle line:84%
right now is really
delicate in a way.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Because what always
happens, too,

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:42.330 align:middle line:84%
when there's transformation
is that it gets amped.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.850 align:middle line:84%
So the place of power over
gets stronger and stronger

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:46.747 align:middle line:84%
and stronger because
it's trying to stay

00:16:46.747 --> 00:16:48.830 align:middle line:84%
as this is the paradigm
that's the most important.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.400 align:middle line:90%
So it starts amping.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And then the change
is trying to come in,

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.820 align:middle line:84%
but it takes time and
patience and perseverance.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And so what I say and
hold over and over

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:07.140 align:middle line:84%
again is that we have to be
willing for it to be messy--

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.290 align:middle line:84%
with ourselves, with men,
with the dialogue between men

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.839 align:middle line:90%
and women, with all the gender.

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:16.200 align:middle line:84%
There's so much change
and fluidity happening.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And we would like it
to be really neat.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:21.839 align:middle line:84%
And just like do this and this
and this and it'll be fine.

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.730 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to be messy.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.349 align:middle line:90%
We're in a big change right now.

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And so how to be
with the messiness.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.820 align:middle line:90%
And be OK with the messiness.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.650 align:middle line:90%
And know that we're learning.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And that we want to
include everybody.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.250 align:middle line:90%
We have to include everybody.

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:38.460 align:middle line:84%
That if we're really going to
make this change where we're

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:43.180 align:middle line:84%
honoring each person's
power, where they are,

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:48.900 align:middle line:84%
what their expression is,
that takes time to undo.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And we start with
ourselves of the undoing.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.702 align:middle line:84%
Where is it that I've put
myself, made myself small?

00:17:55.702 --> 00:17:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Where is it that I'm
carrying forward something

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.660 align:middle line:84%
from my ancestry
or from my heritage

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.830 align:middle line:84%
or from my society that
isn't actually mine?

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And I just see it as
cleaning the closet.

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And now that gets into probably
an even deeper subject.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Again, if you go back
to India, for example,

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.420 align:middle line:84%
reincarnation-- and
much of the world,

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.550 align:middle line:84%
much of the world
reincarnation is a given.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.930 align:middle line:84%
It's understood that
is how the soul works.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:22.320 align:middle line:84%
It goes through these
cycles of learning.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And taking that into
account, we have

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:30.450 align:middle line:90%
women who are accomplished.

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.700 align:middle line:84%
They've pretty much
ticked off the list,

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.020 align:middle line:90%
they're doing fabulously.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.880 align:middle line:84%
But then you put them
back in a relationship

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.270 align:middle line:84%
with a man and one of the
first things that happens,

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:41.190 align:middle line:84%
subconsciously and
almost automatically,

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:44.010 align:middle line:84%
we either start shrinking
down or giving our power away

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:45.390 align:middle line:90%
or catering to.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Just like our mothers
did with our brothers

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.350 align:middle line:90%
or our fathers or what not.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And that is not
gone, by any means.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.570 align:middle line:84%
That is such a
hard-wired program

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:58.370 align:middle line:84%
to put men above ourselves,
whether we know it or not.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Even if we're a
Miss Bossy Pants.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.200 align:middle line:90%
On some level, that happens.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Unless we have a man who
is completely willing

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:04.890 align:middle line:90%
to be subservient.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:05.812 align:middle line:90%
And some men are.

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:06.770 align:middle line:90%
Or some they want that.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Some men are comfortable
that with a very strong,

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:09.870 align:middle line:90%
powerful woman.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:13.510 align:middle line:84%
But looking at a kind
of more average dynamic,

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:17.100 align:middle line:84%
let's call it that, this
is really interesting.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Because all those past life
wounds are still there.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking thousands
of years of programming.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:23.310 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:24.726 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of years
of programming.

00:19:24.726 --> 00:19:26.760 align:middle line:90%
It's in our DNA.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.760 align:middle line:90%
That's in our bodies so deeply.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And we could have been raised by
a really empowered mother that

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.480 align:middle line:90%
are like you can do this.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And yet, that will come
back up, because we're

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.102 align:middle line:90%
not free on the inside yet.

00:19:41.102 --> 00:19:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think sometimes
women get confused,

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:44.610 align:middle line:84%
because we have so
many external freedoms.

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And I've been having
radio interviews recently

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.770 align:middle line:84%
with really
conservative radio that

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:52.620 align:middle line:84%
are saying things like women
have like all the rules.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.730 align:middle line:90%
It's fine.

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.215 align:middle line:90%
Like women are equal.

00:19:55.215 --> 00:19:56.340 align:middle line:90%
They're equal on the books.

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.530 align:middle line:84%
What are you guys
complaining about?

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And to just educate all
of us that we're still

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.600 align:middle line:84%
tied to so many old values
that we're carrying forward

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.830 align:middle line:90%
that we don't even realize.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:08.885 align:middle line:90%
And it's so true.

00:20:08.885 --> 00:20:11.010 align:middle line:84%
We'll get in a situation
in like two or three years

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:13.610 align:middle line:84%
into a relationship
like what have I done?

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:17.740 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so ingrained
that we pass our power

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.780 align:middle line:90%
over without realizing it.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And so the first place is how do
we become aware of the dynamic

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.960 align:middle line:84%
and then not punish
ourselves for it.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.770 align:middle line:84%
But just realize big shift
in the process of happening.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:30.849 align:middle line:90%
And it's not personal.

00:20:30.849 --> 00:20:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it seems
to me, in my experience,

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:36.060 align:middle line:84%
it requires a tremendous
amount of open communication.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.180 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
is, for example,

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.520 align:middle line:84%
taking women's traits--
along this same line--

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.670 align:middle line:84%
one thing women have
lived by-- if men

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:46.000 align:middle line:84%
have lived by overt
competition among themselves,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.700 align:middle line:84%
kind of straight up and
punch someone in the nose.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And the next day
you're friends again.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.790 align:middle line:90%
That's not true with women.

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:56.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely different,
more subversive kind of reality

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:00.990 align:middle line:84%
in that we would tend
to sabotage one another.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of what
gossip is all about.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Sabotage one
another, for example.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.980 align:middle line:84%
To feel a lot of envy,
a lot of jealousy.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.380 align:middle line:84%
But then if you
start looking back,

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.890 align:middle line:84%
where you were essentially
right up till quite recently,

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:17.290 align:middle line:84%
is a property of
someone that could

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:20.200 align:middle line:84%
be that was totally
dependent upon them.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.750 align:middle line:84%
They could be thrown over
for the next person that

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:26.050 align:middle line:84%
comes along or someone
prettier, or younger, or kinder,

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:27.775 align:middle line:90%
or who baked better, whatever.

00:21:27.775 --> 00:21:29.530 align:middle line:84%
You could be thrown
over at any minute

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:31.320 align:middle line:90%
and have no means of support.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.010 align:middle line:90%
Now that's deep in the aura.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Survival is always at stake.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes, yes.

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And that sense of
safety is huge.

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:42.317 align:middle line:84%
And to recognize that's so much
what's driving our behaviors.

00:21:42.317 --> 00:21:43.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And to really help men
understand, because they think

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:47.980 align:middle line:84%
women are just nuts,
or they're psycho,

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.200 align:middle line:84%
or they're irrational,
unreasonable.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.310 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do a thing.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.060 align:middle line:90%
Why is she accusing me of that?

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:53.860 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:58.300 align:middle line:84%
It does look irrational from
the outside when this happens.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.580 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is
it's based in something

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:04.180 align:middle line:84%
so deep that would make a very
rich conversation if people

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:05.050 align:middle line:90%
could go there.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:06.466 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: If people
could go there.

00:22:06.466 --> 00:22:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's so true, us
opening up the conversations

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.990 align:middle line:90%
between men and women.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Women opening up the
conversation around competition

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.600 align:middle line:90%
and sabotage and backstabbing.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And really beginning to say
how do we deal with this?

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:23.520 align:middle line:84%
How do we talk about this
without shaming each other?

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.640 align:middle line:90%
How do we point it out?

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And how do we start
changing our behavior?

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.743 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So have you begun
working with this with women

00:22:28.743 --> 00:22:31.220 align:middle line:84%
to help them begin these
dialogues with each other?

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:32.830 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And part of what I do
is bring women together

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.027 align:middle line:84%
to have the experience
of being supported.

00:22:37.027 --> 00:22:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Because what I'm finding--
which shocked me,

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.068 align:middle line:90%
because I've been so blessed.

00:22:40.068 --> 00:22:43.150 align:middle line:84%
I've had so many good
women circles and friends

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and I've just been
incredibly blessed--

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:49.610 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of the women that I
work with have never had that.

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:50.500 align:middle line:90%
Ever.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.260 align:middle line:90%
They've only felt competition.

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.910 align:middle line:84%
You know maybe they
have one friend.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:58.060 align:middle line:84%
But to be then in a space for
them where all of a sudden

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.490 align:middle line:84%
there are all these women
supporting them and seeing

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:03.857 align:middle line:84%
them and loving them for where
they're at it is mind blowing.

00:23:03.857 --> 00:23:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be just
like I didn't even

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.400 align:middle line:90%
know this was possible.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And so that for me
is like level number

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.160 align:middle line:84%
one is open the door to
show what's possible.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.890 align:middle line:84%
That women actually
can support each other.

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And that you can
be held and seen,

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:20.280 align:middle line:84%
and reflected, and
cheerleaded on.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And that then once they have
that sense of this is possible,

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:24.070 align:middle line:90%
then--

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:27.780 align:middle line:84%
because it's not just all
magic and that's how it is--

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.560 align:middle line:84%
then our stuff
starts showing up.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
to then do the work

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.450 align:middle line:84%
to clean out the old agreements
and beliefs that we have,

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:36.430 align:middle line:90%
the old patterns and habits.

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:38.530 align:middle line:84%
But to really
recognize it's not--

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:41.772 align:middle line:84%
so often women feel so
much guilt and shame

00:23:41.772 --> 00:23:43.730 align:middle line:84%
for their actions or how
they've been treated--

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or even
their feelings.

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes Yeah.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And we feel like it's
I'm the only one.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And to take the context
bigger and say look

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:54.560 align:middle line:84%
at what we're in the middle
of transforming right now,

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.360 align:middle line:90%
it's huge.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And each of us is doing
big work to do that.

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:02.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How
successful-- I mean,

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:04.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm assuming this is being
done because women are looking

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.060 align:middle line:84%
to not only find that kind
of honesty in themselves,

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.130 align:middle line:84%
but to create this within
their relationships.

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.205 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So why
don't we start talking

00:24:12.205 --> 00:24:15.620 align:middle line:84%
about how you began working
with women to open up

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:18.890 align:middle line:84%
this dialogue, kind
of the process of it.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And then how you
instruct them to begin

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.510 align:middle line:84%
opening up this
process of working

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.089 align:middle line:90%
with their significant others.

00:24:25.089 --> 00:24:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Or if they're single,
to begin laying

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:29.040 align:middle line:84%
the framework for having
a healthy relationship

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:29.840 align:middle line:90%
with someone.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:30.640 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yeah.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, I start by doing
an overview that we all

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.314 align:middle line:90%
have conscious agreements.

00:24:35.314 --> 00:24:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think of as the
tip of the iceberg

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:38.270 align:middle line:90%
is the conscious agreements.

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And in a relationship,
a good relationship,

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:42.700 align:middle line:84%
you're clear with what
your agreements are

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.050 align:middle line:84%
in term of the
relationship, whether that's

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:47.270 align:middle line:84%
a relationship at
work, whether that's

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.200 align:middle line:90%
an intimate relationship.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.382 align:middle line:84%
And so at work you
know our agreement

00:24:51.382 --> 00:24:53.090 align:middle line:84%
is I'm going to work
for this many hours,

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:55.381 align:middle line:84%
and get paid this much, and
this is my job description.

00:24:55.381 --> 00:24:56.870 align:middle line:90%
And that's clear.

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:59.725 align:middle line:84%
And we often don't do
that in relationships.

00:24:59.725 --> 00:25:01.280 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't
even think about it.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
sound very romantic.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:04.499 align:middle line:90%
But it's so important.

00:25:04.499 --> 00:25:06.290 align:middle line:84%
So those-- so those
unconscious agreements,

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:08.331 align:middle line:84%
there's actually not that
many, because we're not

00:25:08.331 --> 00:25:09.140 align:middle line:90%
trained this way.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.580 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot-- if
you look at the iceberg.

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:15.230 align:middle line:84%
This is the tip underneath of
all the unconscious agreements.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And those are what actually
drive all of our behaviors.

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're incredibly
powerful, because they're often

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:21.950 align:middle line:90%
coupled with emotion.

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:23.660 align:middle line:90%
So they're super strong.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And you can be doing great and
like rocking it at your work

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.700 align:middle line:84%
and getting along
with your parents.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And then you get into a
relationship and puh really

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:36.440 align:middle line:84%
difficult. Suddenly you're
talking like a little girl.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.273 align:middle line:84%
You're not sharing
what's going on with you.

00:25:38.273 --> 00:25:39.950 align:middle line:90%
Or you're trying to please.

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:42.140 align:middle line:90%
And so to look at--

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:46.150 align:middle line:84%
I guide women to look at what
are the unconscious agreements?

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:47.827 align:middle line:90%
And to start to bring them up--

00:25:47.827 --> 00:25:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So how do you do this?

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.470 align:middle line:84%
What are the methods of
doing this with women?

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:53.060 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Part of it's dialogue.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.190 align:middle line:90%
Part of it's brainstorming.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:57.900 align:middle line:84%
To get a bunch of women in
the room and to say, OK,

00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.480 align:middle line:90%
what did you learn?

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.640 align:middle line:84%
What was modeled
from your parents?

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.500 align:middle line:84%
What did you learn
from your peer group?

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And so to start throwing
things out and brainstorming

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:10.070 align:middle line:90%
and increasing the awareness.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And then to increase
the awareness

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.970 align:middle line:84%
to go out into your world
and start paying attention to

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:15.710 align:middle line:90%
how am I responding to things?

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:16.770 align:middle line:90%
What am I thinking?

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:18.680 align:middle line:90%
What am I feeling?

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.930 align:middle line:90%
And I call this stalking.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Learning to stalk ourselves so
that we're watching constantly

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.520 align:middle line:84%
from that place of witness and
being really, really curious.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And where most women get stuck
is that we judge ourselves.

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you judge
yourself, you become aware

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and then you judge
yourself, the energy

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:42.450 align:middle line:84%
you need to make the change
goes into the judgment.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And so learning how to
witness yourself is huge.

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:49.180 align:middle line:90%
Just that piece.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.944 align:middle line:84%
And then that place
of awareness then.

00:26:51.944 --> 00:26:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Then we can start
to transform it.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.395 align:middle line:84%
We can't transform what
we're not aware of.

00:26:55.395 --> 00:26:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
you're suggesting that

00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:00.959 align:middle line:84%
by simply watching your feelings
and watching your observations

00:27:00.959 --> 00:27:02.750 align:middle line:84%
that this is going to
be the doorway to all

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:04.220 align:middle line:90%
of that subconscious stuff?

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: It absolutely helps.

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:06.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Because you start realizing,
wow, somebody just

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:10.370 align:middle line:90%
cut me off in traffic.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:13.010 align:middle line:84%
And instead of getting
pissed about that, now

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:16.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about the way that
my father never listened to me.

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.700 align:middle line:84%
And most of the times we
wouldn't even notice that.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.669 align:middle line:84%
But the moment you
open your awareness

00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:23.210 align:middle line:84%
and you're watching
what's happening,

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.700 align:middle line:84%
you're like whoa
what is it that?

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.124 align:middle line:90%
My father doesn't listen to me.

00:27:27.124 --> 00:27:28.790 align:middle line:84%
Where else have I
heard myself say that?

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:31.173 align:middle line:84%
Whoa, I just said that
to my partner yesterday.

00:27:31.173 --> 00:27:32.040 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:32.490 align:middle line:90%
That's curious.

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So basic mindfulness--

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:33.950 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Basic mindfulness.

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --in being observant
of what you're feeling

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.837 align:middle line:84%
and what's going on in the
moment is the primary strategy.

00:27:39.837 --> 00:27:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Foundation.

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:42.020 align:middle line:90%
That's the foundation.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And then the
transformational part

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:47.190 align:middle line:84%
is then around starting to do
things that break old patterns.

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:50.540 align:middle line:84%
So give us some examples
of how you have people

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.112 align:middle line:90%
break their old patterns.

00:27:52.112 --> 00:27:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: So there's
two ways that I

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:55.225 align:middle line:90%
work with people around that.

00:27:55.225 --> 00:27:59.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a gazillion,
but we'll say two main ones.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:03.170 align:middle line:84%
One is to do what
we call not doings.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.900 align:middle line:84%
So to look at what your
habits are and start

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:07.460 align:middle line:90%
doing things that are opposite.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:11.000 align:middle line:84%
So really simple ones are
things like putting your clothes

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.240 align:middle line:84%
on a different way, driving to
work a different way every day,

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.550 align:middle line:84%
brushing your teeth
with your opposite hand.

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:19.612 align:middle line:84%
And it seems very like,
well, that's so simple.

00:28:19.612 --> 00:28:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And what you're doing, though,
is you're reclaiming energy.

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Because every time
you break a pattern

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.930 align:middle line:84%
that's been unconscious,
you become more conscious.

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:29.942 align:middle line:84%
And that opens up your
awareness in a beautiful way.

00:28:29.942 --> 00:28:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And then also to
start doing things

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.620 align:middle line:84%
where you're not going
to have any reward.

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Because in this
society, we are totally

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.540 align:middle line:84%
geared towards what am I
going to get from this?

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:41.000 align:middle line:90%
What's the reward?

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And that, especially for
women, takes us way off base.

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:49.182 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of us, as women,
are caretaking or pleasing

00:28:49.182 --> 00:28:51.390 align:middle line:84%
or trying to figure out what
other people need and we

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:55.530 align:middle line:84%
have no idea who we are
or what we actually want.

00:28:55.530 --> 00:29:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And so to start taking
actions, doing something really

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:05.922 align:middle line:84%
impeccably, like rearranging
something in your house,

00:29:05.922 --> 00:29:07.630 align:middle line:84%
that you make it really
perfect, and then

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:09.310 align:middle line:90%
you completely undo it.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Going outside and
digging a hole and making

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:15.500 align:middle line:84%
like the perfect hole, and
then filling it back in again.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.790 align:middle line:84%
So things that, again, the
mind's like, what is she doing?

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:21.730 align:middle line:84%
But we learn then to
be 100% in an action

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:24.150 align:middle line:84%
that we're taking without
needing the reward for it.

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And that starts the
rewiring process.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:31.210 align:middle line:84%
So these are ways to begin
unwinding the old structures

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:35.077 align:middle line:84%
and beginning to create more
spaciousness inside of a self.

00:29:35.077 --> 00:29:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing I
love doing with people

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:39.400 align:middle line:90%
is running experiments.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:44.230 align:middle line:84%
We often, especially women,
and I know this is true of men

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.820 align:middle line:84%
as well, but we don't
want to make mistakes.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:49.480 align:middle line:84%
We want to do it
perfectly and often we

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:54.000 align:middle line:84%
live with this image of
this is who I should be.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.590 align:middle line:10%
And so we constantly compare
ourselves to that image

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:00.050 align:middle line:10%
instead of actually living here.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:03.370 align:middle line:10%
And we cause ourselves
tremendous suffering,

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:05.870 align:middle line:10%
because instead of like, Hi,
sweetie what do you need today?

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:07.214 align:middle line:90%
How are you doing?

00:30:07.214 --> 00:30:08.630 align:middle line:84%
We're saying I
should be that way.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I should be like I
was 20 years ago.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.490 align:middle line:90%
Or I should be--

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:17.930 align:middle line:84%
whatever we compare, we use
things against ourselves.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And so this place of then
settling into right here.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.000 align:middle line:84%
What is it that I want
to change in my life?

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.370 align:middle line:84%
And what experiment
can I run to change it?

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:29.910 align:middle line:84%
So I'll give you
a great example.

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:32.540 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend who
was a big pleaser.

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:35.840 align:middle line:84%
She loved to make sure everybody
else in the world was OK.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.762 align:middle line:84%
And she started to recognize how
she wasn't standing in herself.

00:30:39.762 --> 00:30:41.720 align:middle line:84%
She was just, somebody
would ask her something,

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.272 align:middle line:90%
she'd be like yes, yes, yes.

00:30:43.272 --> 00:30:45.230 align:middle line:84%
She wanted to be an artist
but didn't have time

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:47.747 align:middle line:84%
to be an artist, she was
busy fixing everybody else.

00:30:47.747 --> 00:30:50.330 align:middle line:84%
So the assignment I gave her, I
said, let's run an experiment.

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:52.650 align:middle line:90%
Run it for a week.

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd like
you to do is anytime

00:30:55.040 --> 00:31:00.370 align:middle line:84%
anybody asks you for
anything, your response is no.

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:03.180 align:middle line:90%
And don't explain, just say, no.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.590 align:middle line:84%
So it was very
funny, because what

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.924 align:middle line:84%
happened is four days into
the experiment, I called her.

00:31:07.924 --> 00:31:09.923 align:middle line:84%
And I'd forgotten she was
doing this experiment.

00:31:09.923 --> 00:31:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hey, can you take
me to the airport next week?

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:14.250 align:middle line:90%
And she goes no.

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:16.450 align:middle line:90%
But call me next week.

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, oh, you
are so busted, honey.

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And I called her
the following week

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.765 align:middle line:84%
and I said how many times
did you go back and say yes

00:31:23.765 --> 00:31:24.640 align:middle line:90%
when you had said no?

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.970 align:middle line:90%
She said every single time.

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:29.490 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, let's try
another experiment.

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:32.460 align:middle line:84%
So her next experiment
was to say no again.

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:36.220 align:middle line:84%
But this time we made it three
months or to not wash dishes.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And she actually picked
that one, because to her

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.720 align:middle line:90%
that was inconceivable.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.880 align:middle line:84%
She was a big potluck
person, big in the community,

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.040 align:middle line:84%
and she was always the
person cleaning up.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So here's what happens when
we start to break patterns.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Again, seems super simple, I'm
just not going to wash dishes.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.630 align:middle line:84%
She went through so much
because her guilt came up.

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Her fear that people were going
to think that she was selfish.

00:31:57.330 --> 00:31:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Her feeling that
she was worthless.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Like all of this old
childhood stuff came up simply

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:05.370 align:middle line:90%
by her not washing dishes.

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.829 align:middle line:84%
And with her staying steady
and being aware of it,

00:32:07.829 --> 00:32:10.120 align:middle line:84%
and loving herself, and
supporting herself, and saying,

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.911 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get
through this, that stuff

00:32:11.911 --> 00:32:14.820 align:middle line:90%
started to move and shift.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the three months,

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.690 align:middle line:90%
she was at total choice.

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Wherever she went,
she was like, oh,

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:22.149 align:middle line:84%
I do feel like
washing dishes, oh, I

00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:23.440 align:middle line:90%
don't feel like washing dishes.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:23.532 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:32:23.532 --> 00:32:25.407 align:middle line:84%
No, I think things are
wonderful experiments.

00:32:25.407 --> 00:32:27.180 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: So fun and deep.

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Well now when you talk
about women always giving,

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:32.850 align:middle line:90%
that is true.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:34.920 align:middle line:90%
But they also have the list.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.810 align:middle line:90%
Women are looking for the list.

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:40.560 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me this is
not going well societally.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.726 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:32:41.726 --> 00:32:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're
looking for partners,

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:45.660 align:middle line:84%
or they're looking for
the partners they already

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:49.950 align:middle line:84%
have to fulfill the list of
their desires and demands.

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing when they're
looking for a new partner.

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:54.330 align:middle line:84%
I know a number of
women who actually

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:57.660 align:middle line:84%
write a list of
what the traits are,

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:01.800 align:middle line:84%
the characteristics are, rather
than the heart or essence of.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.840 align:middle line:84%
It's as though women
have certainly,

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.460 align:middle line:84%
every bit as much as men,
gotten away from the essence.

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.910 align:middle line:90%
Very true.

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:09.915 align:middle line:90%
And it's an ideal.

00:33:09.915 --> 00:33:11.331 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it's
a taking thing.

00:33:11.331 --> 00:33:12.480 align:middle line:90%
It's not a giving thing.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.360 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: It is.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.730 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:16.545 align:middle line:84%
And we have to be really
honest about that.

00:33:16.545 --> 00:33:20.670 align:middle line:84%
That we then take what we do
to ourself and then expect

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:23.370 align:middle line:84%
like I'm going to try and live
up to this image of perfection.

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And now I need you to live
up to my image of perfection.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to judge you
and use things against you

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.630 align:middle line:84%
in and punish you to
make you behave the way I

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:35.251 align:middle line:90%
think you should be behaving.

00:33:35.251 --> 00:33:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Punishment's always
a really good incentive,

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:38.300 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:39.972 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: It's such
a great incentive.

00:33:39.972 --> 00:33:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet people do it
subconsciously all the time.

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:44.025 align:middle line:90%
Both sexes do this all the time.

00:33:44.025 --> 00:33:44.858 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Absolutely.

00:33:44.858 --> 00:33:46.120 align:middle line:90%
And don't realize it.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And I've been in dialogue
with a lot of people

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:51.404 align:middle line:84%
about this idea of what's
unconditional love, because we

00:33:51.404 --> 00:33:53.070 align:middle line:84%
sometimes think
unconditional love means

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:56.644 align:middle line:84%
you can do whatever
you want, and I don't

00:33:56.644 --> 00:33:57.810 align:middle line:90%
have to have any boundaries.

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:00.276 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to set--

00:34:00.276 --> 00:34:01.650 align:middle line:84%
like if you're
abusing me, that's

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:03.900 align:middle line:84%
OK. because I love
you unconditionally.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Well what we're learning
to do is to be open,

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:11.850 align:middle line:84%
is how I think
about it, and really

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:15.960 align:middle line:84%
love who we're with
for who they are.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Knowing they're
going to be quirky.

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:20.850 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be things
that they're working through.

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And how do we find the
spaciousness and the grace

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:26.469 align:middle line:84%
to accept people
for where they're

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:30.360 align:middle line:84%
at but to accept ourselves
for where we are at,

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.250 align:middle line:90%
because that's the real key.

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:35.159 align:middle line:84%
And that takes practice
and communication.

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:37.380 align:middle line:84%
So bring the willingness
to communicate

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:41.159 align:middle line:90%
and be totally honest of like--

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:44.460 align:middle line:84%
I would love you to stop
doing that and let me--

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.800 align:middle line:84%
and I also know that it's
your right to do that.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
issues of control and power

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.423 align:middle line:84%
struggles when it
comes to control?

00:34:52.423 --> 00:34:53.389 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Constant.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:54.810 align:middle line:90%
We're always.

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And again, if we start to name
it and have fun with it-- what

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:02.160 align:middle line:84%
I've seen moves things the
most within relationships

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:06.420 align:middle line:84%
is if both people are willing
to play around the healing

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:09.570 align:middle line:84%
and to not have this idea if
we're in a good relationship,

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:12.030 align:middle line:84%
we never argue, we're
always completely loving

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:14.650 align:middle line:84%
with each other, and
it's always perfect,

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:17.790 align:middle line:84%
but to recognize
relationships take work.

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have to
be hard work, though.

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:22.850 align:middle line:90%
It can be play fun work.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:25.427 align:middle line:84%
With my ex-husband, we
would get into places

00:35:25.427 --> 00:35:27.260 align:middle line:84%
where we'd be really
furious with each other

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:27.680 align:middle line:90%
around something.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.013 align:middle line:84%
Like something would happen,
we'd get mad at each other.

00:35:30.013 --> 00:35:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And instead of like I
hate it when you do this

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.450 align:middle line:90%
and it really drives me crazy.

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:36.060 align:middle line:84%
We would just start making
animal noises at each other.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon
we'd be laughing.

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And then we could have
a conversation about it.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And our hearts were
back open to each other.

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And so to find ways to
play games with each other

00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:48.449 align:middle line:84%
and to communicate and to
know you're on the same team.

00:35:48.449 --> 00:35:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that's what
happens in relationship

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:52.350 align:middle line:84%
with the power
struggles is we feel

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:55.770 align:middle line:84%
like our identity is
threatened or we're not

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:56.730 align:middle line:90%
getting what we want.

00:35:56.730 --> 00:36:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And so we separate and see
our partner as our enemy

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.390 align:middle line:84%
rather than realizing
we're on the same team.

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:05.660 align:middle line:90%
How do we work together?

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:10.890 align:middle line:84%
How do we stay in dialogue
and be creative in what

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:13.080 align:middle line:90%
we're working through?

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.507 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy.

00:36:14.507 --> 00:36:16.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You talk
about, in the book,

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:22.110 align:middle line:84%
you talk about warrior
goddess doesn't have any need

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:26.970 align:middle line:84%
to control life, but also nor
any need to understand life.

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:29.650 align:middle line:90%
Now what does that mean?

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: We create
suffering for ourselves

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:35.640 align:middle line:84%
when we think reality
should be a certain way.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And one of my favorite
quotes is from Byron Katie

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:39.700 align:middle line:84%
who says, "You can
argue with reality

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:43.760 align:middle line:84%
but reality is only going
to win 100% of the time."

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:47.530 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I love working with

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:50.230 align:middle line:90%
is the seasons and the cycles.

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And that we tend to think
life is supposed to be linear.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:55.615 align:middle line:84%
We get into this-- in
the West, we especially

00:36:55.615 --> 00:36:56.615 align:middle line:90%
are like life is linear.

00:36:56.615 --> 00:36:58.490 align:middle line:84%
If you just do this
and this and this,

00:36:58.490 --> 00:36:59.870 align:middle line:90%
then this will be the result.

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:02.000 align:middle line:90%
But life doesn't work that way.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.080 align:middle line:90%
We want it to.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.630 align:middle line:84%
But life is about beginnings
and endings, constantly,

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:07.670 align:middle line:90%
things dying, things being born.

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:08.990 align:middle line:90%
It's messy.

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:12.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's not controllable.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.810 align:middle line:84%
As much as we try to
think it is, it's not.

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:16.610 align:middle line:90%
We can't control death.

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:19.649 align:middle line:84%
With all that we've done,
we can't control death.

00:37:19.649 --> 00:37:20.690 align:middle line:90%
We can't control illness.

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:24.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean we can manage it
sometimes, but not really.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.334 align:middle line:84%
And so how to be in relationship
with what's happening--

00:37:27.334 --> 00:37:29.000 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't mean,
oh, well, it's just

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.870 align:middle line:84%
the way it is, it means
being fully alive,

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:34.580 align:middle line:84%
being with our grief
when there's grief,

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:37.280 align:middle line:84%
being with whatever
emotion is there.

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And loving all aspects of
being human is how I see it.

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:45.410 align:middle line:84%
And so the control
piece just causes

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:48.230 align:middle line:90%
us to be in pain and suffering.

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And learning to open and to
trust that it may not feel good

00:37:54.230 --> 00:38:00.800 align:middle line:84%
in the moment and we can
learn to stay with life

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.550 align:middle line:84%
and know that things are going
to constantly be changing.

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:06.950 align:middle line:90%
That's the truth.

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You say
that it's good that--

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:13.400 align:middle line:84%
one of the tenets is that we
have to take responsibility

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.330 align:middle line:90%
for our family story.

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:16.450 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's again get into
the lineage stuff.

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes, yes.

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:24.650 align:middle line:84%
We energetically carry
on what's come before us.

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And I sometimes think of it as
a really bad game of telephone.

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:29.210 align:middle line:90%
That something happened way--

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:31.260 align:middle line:84%
and then it just
gets passed down.

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So by the time that we
have whatever it is,

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:36.470 align:middle line:84%
we don't even know where it came
from, it is slightly garbled.

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:40.850 align:middle line:84%
So examples of things that
get passed down the lineage

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:45.200 align:middle line:84%
will say women's
experience of needing

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.690 align:middle line:90%
to stay small to be safe.

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And not true so much in the
Western world, but very true

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.830 align:middle line:84%
100 years ago, 200
years ago, for example.

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:58.400 align:middle line:84%
So opening that the work
that we're doing now

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:03.080 align:middle line:84%
is not just for ourself, it's
also to heal in the past.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.970 align:middle line:90%
It's also to heal forward.

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And we're in this
incredible moment of time

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:09.980 align:middle line:84%
that I feel like ripples
out in all directions.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Anything that we heal affects
time backwards and forwards.

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes putting that
in that larger context

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:23.720 align:middle line:84%
helps because we
don't feel so alone.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And we also feel, OK, I have the
motivation to transform this.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.330 align:middle line:84%
But to realize those energetic
patterns are very strong.

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And in part of
the work that I do

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:38.930 align:middle line:84%
is teach people how to
go back into their past,

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:42.800 align:middle line:84%
this life and past lives,
but the ancestral piece

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:46.400 align:middle line:84%
to reclaim energy
that we've lost.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And what most of us look
like as humans is colanders.

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:52.370 align:middle line:84%
We're constantly leaking
energy without realizing it.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of our
energy is in the past.

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of our--
and then these lines

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:59.529 align:middle line:84%
of energy from our
ancestor also come through.

00:39:59.529 --> 00:40:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And so we're acting out of
those rather than acting out

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:04.250 align:middle line:90%
of what's true for us.

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And so very simple practices of
beginning to rewire ourselves,

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:11.570 align:middle line:84%
giving ourselves permission to
bring our energy from the past

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:14.210 align:middle line:90%
so it's totally present here.

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And to learn how to call
energy up, hold that energy so

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.480 align:middle line:84%
that we're not
leaking it back again,

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.100 align:middle line:84%
and then choose where
we want to put it.

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a deep, beautiful
rewiring of ourselves.

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And the willingness to see what
am I carrying without blame,

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:38.212 align:middle line:90%
because that doesn't heal.

00:40:38.212 --> 00:40:39.670 align:middle line:84%
The going back and
blaming, I can't

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.961 align:middle line:84%
believe that my mother did
this or that my great, great

00:40:41.961 --> 00:40:44.280 align:middle line:84%
grandmother passed this stuff
on to me, it's not fair.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But if
you go into past

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:46.600 align:middle line:90%
lives that you did it yourself.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.410 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:48.210 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:50.470 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, exactly.

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And this moment, we have
this incredible opportunity

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.910 align:middle line:84%
through our awareness, through
our willingness, to love,

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:01.940 align:middle line:84%
I believe, to bring love
as the healing balm.

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness as the
healing balm to start

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:05.776 align:middle line:90%
to unwind these old patterns.

00:41:05.776 --> 00:41:07.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about sexuality

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and how women use sexuality
often not to the best benefit

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:12.680 align:middle line:90%
of themselves or anybody else.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:14.690 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes, yes.

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So we live in a society that has
really created such a huge rift

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:20.480 align:middle line:90%
around sexuality.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And women often use
it, unfortunately,

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:26.390 align:middle line:84%
as a way to get what
they think they want.

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And the dichotomy is you're
supposed to be a virgin

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and you're also supposed
to be a whore in some ways.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.291 align:middle line:84%
If you look at media,
there's these two extremes.

00:41:35.291 --> 00:41:36.665 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
it's the classic.

00:41:36.665 --> 00:41:37.480 align:middle line:90%
Everyone understands it, right?

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: It's classic.

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:42.140 align:middle line:84%
So this place then for us,
again, to be really honest.

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:43.850 align:middle line:84%
What am I doing
with my sexuality?

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Where is the place that I've
put my sexuality as a tool

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:51.620 align:middle line:84%
that I'm using to get
something and to really

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:55.820 align:middle line:84%
recognize that sexuality
is our creative life force.

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.220 align:middle line:90%
That it's for us.

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And just that rewire for a
lot of women is like what?

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.620 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:06.684 align:middle line:84%
So this place of coming back
to doing deep healing with

00:42:06.684 --> 00:42:08.600 align:middle line:84%
the places that we've
gone against ourselves--

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:13.010 align:middle line:84%
because so many of us have
been sexual when we didn't want

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:18.714 align:middle line:84%
to, have used sexuality to
try and hook and get love--

00:42:18.714 --> 00:42:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a large
percentage of population

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:22.600 align:middle line:84%
has been sexually abused,
even in childhood.

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Huge, huge percentage.

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.320 align:middle line:84%
So there's all that
confusion and heaviness.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: As well, yeah.

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.700 align:middle line:84%
So when you're working
with women in a group,

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:35.060 align:middle line:84%
are you saying, then, to
go in-- again mindfulness--

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:38.240 align:middle line:90%
go in to reevaluate why?

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And when the opportunity
for sex comes up

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:44.780 align:middle line:84%
why you would be motivated
to have sex in that moment?

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And then take stock
and say, you know, no.

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:52.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I want to go that
direction right now because I

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:54.710 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be honest in doing so.

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And then do you state this
openly with your partner

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.740 align:middle line:84%
and let your partner know you're
working in this way trying

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.360 align:middle line:90%
to work this through yourself?

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:04.940 align:middle line:84%
And so how do you
guide couples, then,

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:09.260 align:middle line:84%
on this journey of becoming
sexually honest, beginning

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.920 align:middle line:90%
with the part of the women?

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.720 align:middle line:84%
I think about it as what
we're working to get to

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.950 align:middle line:90%
with sexual integrity.

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Where we know what
our sexual flow is.

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:19.010 align:middle line:90%
We're honest with it.

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:22.010 align:middle line:84%
We've cleaned up
the places of abuse

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:24.020 align:middle line:90%
or we're in the process of that.

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're owning my sexuality's
for me and my expression.

00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And then to then start that
dialogue with a partner of I'm

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.220 align:middle line:90%
in this process.

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:38.150 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to be awkward.

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:39.691 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
going to be messy.

00:43:39.691 --> 00:43:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
go against myself.

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And I might be like,
yes, no, well--

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So to set the stage of like
can we work this together?

00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:51.939 align:middle line:84%
And how do we work this
together and be creative?

00:43:51.939 --> 00:43:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's an
important conversation, yeah.

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Really important.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.347 align:middle line:84%
And a hard one to have
for a lot of women.

00:43:57.347 --> 00:43:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Especially if they've been
going against themselves over

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:00.910 align:middle line:84%
and over and over again
and just thinking,

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:03.230 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm just going to be
sexual because he wants to

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:04.870 align:middle line:90%
or my partner wants to.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:12.010 align:middle line:84%
So to reclaim that
honesty and vulnerability.

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's something
in partnerships that's

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:19.000 align:middle line:84%
so powerful is when we
lead with vulnerability,

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.490 align:middle line:84%
the conversation often
goes really different.

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:23.802 align:middle line:84%
So the difference
between "there's

00:44:23.802 --> 00:44:25.760 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times I don't
like having sex with you

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.093 align:middle line:84%
and so I want to change that,"
which immediately, you're

00:44:28.093 --> 00:44:29.480 align:middle line:90%
partner is like whoa.

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.280 align:middle line:90%
Attack.

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.760 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:35.289 align:middle line:84%
Versus "I've been doing this
really deep healing work.

00:44:35.289 --> 00:44:36.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm starting to look at myself.

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:39.246 align:middle line:84%
And I'm realizing that I've been
going against myself sometimes.

00:44:39.246 --> 00:44:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really scared to bring
this to you, because I would

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:44.530 align:middle line:90%
guess this wouldn't feel good.

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:47.260 align:middle line:90%
And I care about you.

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And I want us to have a really
great sexual relationship."

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.220 align:middle line:84%
"And the truth is I don't
know how to do this.

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:54.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't how to do this rewire.

00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:55.900 align:middle line:90%
Can we talk about this?"

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Is a really different
conversation.

00:44:58.450 --> 00:45:01.150 align:middle line:84%
So for women, the willingness
for us to lead with

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:03.700 align:middle line:84%
vulnerability in relationships--
and I don't mean everywhere

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:07.270 align:middle line:84%
because that's not the best
thing to do like at your job

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:11.125 align:middle line:84%
or with your ex that
you're struggling with--

00:45:11.125 --> 00:45:12.610 align:middle line:84%
with intimate
relationships, it's

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:14.195 align:middle line:90%
a really beautiful way to lead.

00:45:14.195 --> 00:45:15.940 align:middle line:84%
It's how do I bring
my vulnerability

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:18.070 align:middle line:90%
of what I'm afraid of?

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And that often
will open the door

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:22.200 align:middle line:84%
so there's softness
that comes back.

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:25.260 align:middle line:84%
Of like ooh, I want to,
OK, like how do we do this?

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And think that's
one of the things people tend

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.100 align:middle line:84%
to not understand is that
when they're most vulnerable

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:31.870 align:middle line:84%
is often when they're
most beautiful.

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:33.480 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: So true.

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we try
very hard to cover up

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:38.440 align:middle line:84%
any of our weak links
and vulnerabilities.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that's the
very thing that can heal it.

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.730 align:middle line:90%
So I agree with you on that.

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:46.880 align:middle line:84%
But again, when you
come to this situation,

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.570 align:middle line:84%
a woman might be thinking
to herself, well,

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:51.730 align:middle line:84%
if I'm to be really
honest, I'm just

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:54.100 align:middle line:84%
kind of doing it for
everybody but me.

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we're just
not compatible that way.

00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And maybe this
relationship will end

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:01.790 align:middle line:90%
as a result of my being honest.

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And that is another
area that I think women

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:05.440 align:middle line:90%
are very afraid to look into.

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes, yes.

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
where experimentation helps.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.790 align:middle line:84%
To be honest, it like,
well, that might be true.

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:12.970 align:middle line:90%
And it might not be true.

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And so are you
willing to say, OK,

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:17.950 align:middle line:84%
for the next three months
I'm only going to have

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:19.810 align:middle line:90%
sex when I want to have sex?

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:21.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm just making something up.

00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also going to find
out what do I like sexually.

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:27.160 align:middle line:90%
Like what turns me on?

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:28.810 align:middle line:90%
What am I excited about?

00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And you can run all sorts
of sexual experiments

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:34.450 align:middle line:84%
with your partner
or with yourself

00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:36.760 align:middle line:84%
or just start learning
about your body.

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.140 align:middle line:90%
Like what is my body like now.

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
women don't even know.

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:41.458 align:middle line:84%
They just think, well, my
partner should know my body

00:46:41.458 --> 00:46:42.760 align:middle line:90%
or be able to figure it out.

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:44.407 align:middle line:84%
Without us really
knowing what we like.

00:46:44.407 --> 00:46:45.207 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:46:45.207 --> 00:46:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
books on practicing,

00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:50.830 align:middle line:84%
and mystical sex, tantric
sex, although that's

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:52.000 align:middle line:90%
horribly misunderstood.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Unfortunately, yes.

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but just the idea
of let me explore this.

00:46:56.810 --> 00:47:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Let me start exploring what I
like now and asking for that.

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:03.340 align:middle line:84%
Which is terrifying
for most women.

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.950 align:middle line:84%
In your book, you
talk about a quote

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:09.600 align:middle line:84%
by Pablo Picasso, who
himself was a womanizer.

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And basically saying there
are two kinds of women--

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:13.420 align:middle line:90%
goddesses and doormats.

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:15.950 align:middle line:84%
No why did you put
that in the book?

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: Because I think
that there's a piece of that

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:21.340 align:middle line:90%
that's true for us as women.

00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:23.530 align:middle line:84%
But it was such a stark
comment of like which

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:24.760 align:middle line:90%
do you want to be?

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And how do you
want to be treated?

00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And we are the ones that
are creating that energy.

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:33.130 align:middle line:84%
If we hold "I'm a
doormat," that's

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:36.250 align:middle line:84%
what's going to
come, unfortunately.

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not excusing the
behavior at all, at all.

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.470 align:middle line:84%
If we hold ourselves
as goddesses,

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:46.140 align:middle line:84%
as we see this is my
temple, I am a goddess.

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:47.860 align:middle line:90%
And I deserve to be respected.

00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:51.870 align:middle line:84%
I respect myself, everything
changes energetically.

00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And someone comes
towards us and we're

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:57.700 align:middle line:84%
like no that's not
going to work for me.

00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And there isn't a fight, a
struggle, it's just nope.

00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:03.020 align:middle line:90%
I know who I am.

00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:03.930 align:middle line:90%
I know my value.

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:05.370 align:middle line:90%
I know my worth.

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:08.010 align:middle line:84%
I know that I am a
representation of the divine.

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
will attract and hold.

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And if that's not what's coming,
then just, nope, no thank you.

00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And so that rewire, learning how
to rewire, because a lot of us

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:20.880 align:middle line:90%
are in different places.

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:23.906 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's places I
still go into doormat.

00:48:23.906 --> 00:48:25.530 align:middle line:84%
I'll get into a
particular relationship

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:26.280 align:middle line:90%
and a particular thing.

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And my little girl will
come out and like I just

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:29.400 align:middle line:90%
want them to like me, OK.

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:30.704 align:middle line:90%
And I watch myself.

00:48:30.704 --> 00:48:31.620 align:middle line:90%
And then I'll name it.

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:33.620 align:middle line:84%
I'll be like, oh, I just
went into this pattern.

00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:37.390 align:middle line:90%
Let me like redo it.

00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:41.274 align:middle line:84%
And so we're all at
different levels.

00:48:41.274 --> 00:48:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In the
book, why did you

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:47.520 align:middle line:84%
choose to work with the terms
both warrior and goddess?

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: I love both the terms.

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like for
women we need both.

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:56.040 align:middle line:84%
So warrior energy
is about focus.

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:56.940 align:middle line:90%
It's clarity.

00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:59.430 align:middle line:90%
It's 100% I'm in.

00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And goddess energy is
about opening, receptivity,

00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:03.840 align:middle line:90%
creativity.

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the warrior
energy says I'm going here.

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:07.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm focused.

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.910 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's getting in my way.

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And the goddess
energy says, ooh, I'm

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:11.790 align:middle line:90%
going to go over there.

00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:13.706 align:middle line:84%
Wonder how I can bring
all my friends with me.

00:49:13.706 --> 00:49:16.440 align:middle line:84%
I wonder how we can make this
really pleasurable and playful.

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:19.350 align:middle line:90%
And we need both energies.

00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about if I'm 50%
warrior and I'm 50% goddess,

00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:25.500 align:middle line:90%
then I'll be balanced, at all.

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:30.300 align:middle line:84%
It's what's my unique
expression of these energies.

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And for some of us, we're
way more goddess oriented

00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:33.980 align:middle line:90%
and a little bit warrior.

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what do
you mean by goddess?

00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: I mean there's that
deep, feminine, soft, open

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:42.660 align:middle line:84%
multiple ways of
expressing self.

00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Because there are so
many types of goddesses,

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:46.140 align:middle line:90%
there isn't just one goddess.

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:49.410 align:middle line:84%
There's everything from
Guan Yin, deep compassion,

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:54.150 align:middle line:90%
to Kali, fierce and clear.

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And so this place
of goddess for me

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:01.110 align:middle line:84%
is around owning our
divine feminine self

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:06.150 align:middle line:84%
and our receptivity and
our love, that deep love.

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And some of us,
that's how we roll,

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:12.690 align:middle line:84%
that we're more in that
expressive creative.

00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And I also know a lot of
women that are really warrior.

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:16.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's beautiful.

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're feminine
as well, it's

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:20.760 align:middle line:90%
just a different energetic.

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.530 align:middle line:90%
So there isn't one way.

00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:26.460 align:middle line:84%
There's multiple ways to
blend these energies together.

00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:27.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do you feel--

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:30.240 align:middle line:84%
because the word goddess
for the last 20 years

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.400 align:middle line:84%
kind of came up and
has been used a lot.

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm
asking now is do you

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:38.520 align:middle line:84%
feel equally as comfortable
then conversely calling

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.130 align:middle line:90%
the men gods?

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:42.390 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: That is such
a great question.

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:44.280 align:middle line:90%
And for me the answer is no.

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:47.034 align:middle line:84%
And I still haven't figured
out what's the right word.

00:50:47.034 --> 00:50:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have
never met a woman

00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:51.164 align:middle line:84%
who uses the word goddess that's
comfortable letting the men use

00:50:51.164 --> 00:50:52.455 align:middle line:90%
the word gods about themselves.

00:50:52.455 --> 00:50:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: I know, isn't it funny?

00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:53.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:54.979 align:middle line:90%
And I've been looking at that.

00:50:54.979 --> 00:50:56.434 align:middle line:90%
I'm like why is that?

00:50:56.434 --> 00:50:57.350 align:middle line:90%
And what is the term--

00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have you
figured it out?

00:50:58.380 --> 00:50:59.338 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: I haven't yet.

00:50:59.338 --> 00:51:02.190 align:middle line:84%
It's still, I'm still
really sitting with it

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:04.060 align:middle line:90%
and asking about that.

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah because it's
a term that sets one above,

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:09.690 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Because you're talking
about other realms.

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:15.330 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
other non earthly realms

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:18.349 align:middle line:84%
when you speak in the terms
of gods and goddesses.

00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And women seem-- again, this
is part of the woman thing

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.030 align:middle line:84%
we have to be
honest about-- seem

00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:24.990 align:middle line:84%
to be perfectly happy to
claim the term goddess,

00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:28.290 align:middle line:84%
but are very offended if men
would say, well, I am a god.

00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes, yeah.

00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:31.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's because of the power.

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:33.420 align:middle line:84%
This is the dynamic that
we're in the middle.

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Women are working
to own their power.

00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And so to say I'm a goddess is
the antidote we can say to I'm

00:51:42.070 --> 00:51:42.870 align:middle line:90%
not enough.

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's like
an overcorrection.

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:45.273 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: It's an overcorrection.

00:51:45.273 --> 00:51:46.400 align:middle line:90%
Exactly, exactly.

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:47.400 align:middle line:90%
It is an overcorrection.

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:47.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do.

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:48.640 align:middle line:90%
I agree with that.

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:49.900 align:middle line:90%
I think it is an overcorrection.

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:50.100 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yeah.

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:50.970 align:middle line:90%
I totally agree with that.

00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:52.386 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there's
going to have

00:51:52.386 --> 00:51:54.180 align:middle line:84%
to come a point when
we no longer feel

00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:55.800 align:middle line:84%
we need to overcorrect
and we can just

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:56.826 align:middle line:90%
be women and men again.

00:51:56.826 --> 00:51:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>AMARA: And we just be
human like all of it.

00:51:58.700 --> 00:51:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Be humans again.

00:51:59.100 --> 00:51:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Exactly.

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.050 align:middle line:90%
I really agree.

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And we also have to be honest
that there is a power dynamic.

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And we are in a place of
trying to correct something.

00:52:08.070 --> 00:52:09.330 align:middle line:90%
And we hope with everything--

00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:11.760 align:middle line:84%
I hope with everything,
because I don't--

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.050 align:middle line:90%
the labels is just a label.

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:14.790 align:middle line:90%
The words are just words.

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And they don't really
mean anything honestly.

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:20.670 align:middle line:84%
It's all about us
expressing who we are.

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:24.720 align:middle line:90%
But we use language to do that.

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:25.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And then it--

00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:29.340 align:middle line:84%
really all of it, everything
I've heard you say thus far--

00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:33.720 align:middle line:84%
is about our being able to
discern what's truthful.

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And again this is
not an easy task

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:39.480 align:middle line:84%
in that you can get glimpses
of it, because of our reactions

00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:40.281 align:middle line:90%
to life.

00:52:40.281 --> 00:52:41.080 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:43.110 align:middle line:84%
So you can think, hmm,
where did that come from?

00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And you can begin
back engineering a bit

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:48.120 align:middle line:90%
as a result of reaction.

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.880 align:middle line:84%
But in reality,
we don't know what

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:54.900 align:middle line:84%
it is that lurks deep in the
subconscious for the most part

00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:56.430 align:middle line:90%
that is motivating a lot of it.

00:52:56.430 --> 00:52:58.620 align:middle line:84%
So and a person can
go, if they want to go,

00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:00.720 align:middle line:84%
into regression or
past life regression,

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:02.490 align:middle line:84%
really start mucking
around in there.

00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:04.980 align:middle line:84%
You can get to some
of those details.

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:09.210 align:middle line:84%
But this level of truth and
then acceptance at the same time

00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:11.550 align:middle line:84%
seems to be the sweet
spot where things

00:53:11.550 --> 00:53:13.240 align:middle line:90%
are going to start happening.

00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:14.370 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Absolutely.

00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And we don't need to know
where things came from.

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:20.680 align:middle line:84%
We only need to be able to
see what am I doing now,

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:21.480 align:middle line:90%
like you're saying.

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And then guess, well, what
agreement might have I made?

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:28.806 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter where it
came from or which lifetime.

00:53:28.806 --> 00:53:31.590 align:middle line:84%
But what might I be
holding that's not true

00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:32.744 align:middle line:90%
that's holding me back.

00:53:32.744 --> 00:53:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that is, that's
a highly individual journey.

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.576 align:middle line:84%
I tend to be one
that always wants

00:53:36.576 --> 00:53:37.920 align:middle line:90%
to get to the bottom of things.

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.210 align:middle line:90%
I want to know the truth.

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:42.270 align:middle line:84%
I've done loads of you
know regressions for fun.

00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:43.890 align:middle line:90%
But you stumble on things.

00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I've
come to realize

00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:49.110 align:middle line:84%
in going through quite a lot
of past life regressions,

00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:51.720 align:middle line:84%
really just for fun not
particularly looking

00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:57.720 align:middle line:84%
for a specific thing, is you
do bump up against truth,

00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.980 align:middle line:90%
deeper truths, or patterns.

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's say patterns that have
happened again and again.

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I really
started understanding

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:10.320 align:middle line:84%
that is where the answer to this
conundrum between men and women

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:11.260 align:middle line:90%
lie.

00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:14.665 align:middle line:84%
And I think again, again,
if this were my world.

00:54:14.665 --> 00:54:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I kind of played
queen for a day, I'd say,

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:19.704 align:middle line:84%
first of all if we can accept
the notion that we incarnate,

00:54:19.704 --> 00:54:21.870 align:middle line:84%
incarnate, incarnate, and
learn, and learn, and have

00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:23.020 align:middle line:90%
been through a lot.

00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And we can just kind of look
at that as a baseline reality,

00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:29.730 align:middle line:84%
then we can understand the depth
of the baggage that's there.

00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And once we understand
that, then we

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.230 align:middle line:84%
can have a little
more open dialogue.

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:37.410 align:middle line:84%
It's like, jeez, I remember
when I was vivisected last time.

00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:40.130 align:middle line:90%
That didn't go well.

00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:43.290 align:middle line:84%
The only value of knowing these
things is to kind of create--

00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:45.630 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not suggesting it's
for everyone, it's not--

00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:48.870 align:middle line:84%
but to create a portrait
of just how traumatized

00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:50.310 align:middle line:90%
every human being has been.

00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:52.287 align:middle line:84%
Men have been
vivisected even more so.

00:54:52.287 --> 00:54:53.620 align:middle line:90%
They've been on the battlefield.

00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:57.630 align:middle line:84%
They've been sequestered with
other men for years at a time.

00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:00.300 align:middle line:84%
That's created a whole
different sexual dynamic

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:03.660 align:middle line:84%
that is embedded within men,
that perpetuates itself again

00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:05.820 align:middle line:84%
lifetime after lifetime,
and maybe in terms

00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:08.610 align:middle line:84%
of being attracted to other
men almost exclusively

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:09.760 align:middle line:90%
and not understanding why.

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And learning that,
OK, that is how

00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:14.730 align:middle line:84%
it was done when you were
in the military for 20

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:16.870 align:middle line:84%
years of your life and
out on the road together.

00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:18.227 align:middle line:90%
It just worked out that way.

00:55:18.227 --> 00:55:19.560 align:middle line:90%
And so you develop propensities.

00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:21.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean it gets really
interesting when

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:25.682 align:middle line:84%
you start mucking around in the
subconscious or the repository,

00:55:25.682 --> 00:55:27.390 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to
call the repository,

00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:30.360 align:middle line:84%
for everything
one has ever been.

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And if we can start working
through that dynamic,

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:34.770 align:middle line:84%
I think we have a
chance at beginning

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:38.640 align:middle line:84%
to heal this rift between us
and start accepting why we're

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:41.220 align:middle line:84%
motivated, why we have
the desires we have,

00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:44.910 align:middle line:90%
and the attractions we have.

00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:47.414 align:middle line:84%
We're right now, I think,
at the most confused point

00:55:47.414 --> 00:55:48.330 align:middle line:90%
we may have ever been.

00:55:48.330 --> 00:55:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: I agree.

00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:53.410 align:middle line:90%
It's messy.

00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:54.210 align:middle line:90%
It's confusing.

00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:56.626 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you do have to
muck around a bit to find out

00:55:56.626 --> 00:55:57.850 align:middle line:90%
what is at the base of that.

00:55:57.850 --> 00:55:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes.

00:55:58.650 --> 00:56:00.390 align:middle line:90%
And to realize that we've been--

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:05.610 align:middle line:84%
within our lifetimes-- we've
been in very clear defined

00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:07.387 align:middle line:84%
models of this is what
it means to be man

00:56:07.387 --> 00:56:08.970 align:middle line:84%
and this is what it
means to be woman.

00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:11.910 align:middle line:90%
And those are rapidly going.

00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And so tons of confusion
for men of like

00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:15.270 align:middle line:90%
how am I supposed to be?

00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Tons of confusion for women.

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:18.540 align:middle line:90%
And that leaves possibility.

00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:19.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It does.

00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:21.214 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the same
time, the wonderful thing

00:56:21.214 --> 00:56:24.850 align:middle line:84%
that never changes is the
universe is based on it.

00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:27.060 align:middle line:90%
The atomic world is based on it.

00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:31.050 align:middle line:84%
There is a masculine-feminine
dynamic, electromagnetic

00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:34.140 align:middle line:84%
dynamic, that is at the base
of the creation of everything

00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:35.520 align:middle line:90%
within the cosmos.

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:38.490 align:middle line:84%
So those dynamics
are alive within us.

00:56:38.490 --> 00:56:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And so we can still find out
which of those polarities

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:48.870 align:middle line:84%
were more or less operating
on, and then make our choices,

00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and our alliances based on what
we've come to learn about that.

00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:55.200 align:middle line:84%
Am I more masculine or
feminine in my own being?

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:58.294 align:middle line:84%
That's going to determine what
my ultimate choice will be.

00:56:58.294 --> 00:56:59.710 align:middle line:84%
But we need to be
honest about it.

00:56:59.710 --> 00:57:03.677 align:middle line:84%
You can't be a little you
know femme fatale pretending

00:57:03.677 --> 00:57:06.010 align:middle line:84%
to be one thing when you're
actually quite the opposite.

00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lot of that
historical trickery among women

00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:10.950 align:middle line:90%
that has gone on, too.

00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's been our
survival mechanism.

00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:15.090 align:middle line:90%
There's no demonizing men.

00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:16.580 align:middle line:90%
There's no demonizing women.

00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:17.490 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yeah, yeah.

00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's also very
interesting that we're also

00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:24.540 align:middle line:84%
in this process of healing
a lot of sexual trauma

00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:25.600 align:middle line:90%
and perpetration.

00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's again super messy that
so much is coming up right now.

00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:37.530 align:middle line:84%
But to stay steady with
everybody is affected by this.

00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everyone.

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:39.709 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Everyone is affected.

00:57:39.709 --> 00:57:42.217 align:middle line:84%
And to really keep shifting
out of black-white,

00:57:42.217 --> 00:57:43.800 align:middle line:84%
victim-perpetrator,
because that's not

00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:45.330 align:middle line:90%
going to heal anything.

00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:48.302 align:middle line:10%
But to open to this bigger
picture of what's needed now.

00:57:48.302 --> 00:57:50.760 align:middle line:10%
When things get really messy,
what's needed more than ever?

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:52.990 align:middle line:10%
Compassion, love.

00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:56.710 align:middle line:10%
To bring that in and recognize
we're all doing our best.

00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:57.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:57:57.510 --> 00:57:58.890 align:middle line:90%
Compassion, truth, and love.

00:57:58.890 --> 00:58:00.460 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Yes, yes.

00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:01.260 align:middle line:90%
The holy trinity.

00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right, exactly.

00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Well thank you so
much for your time.

00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And welcome back
from India and Bali.

00:58:05.850 --> 00:58:06.285 align:middle line:90%
>>AMARA: Thank you.

00:58:06.285 --> 00:58:07.155 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:58:07.155 --> 00:58:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I hope you've
found some comfort

00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:11.610 align:middle line:84%
in these very basic,
but truthful, steps

00:58:11.610 --> 00:58:13.320 align:middle line:90%
for feminine empowerment.

00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:16.230 align:middle line:10%
Again the name of the book is
"Warrior Goddess Training."

00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:19.200 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.
