00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:30.010 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: Some of
you might recognize Dr. Lauren

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.930 align:middle line:10%
Cielo from his interview
with George Noory

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.030 align:middle line:10%
as a psychic and
spiritual teacher.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.280 align:middle line:84%
At the time, Lauren was
a woman, and has since

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.960 align:middle line:90%
transitioned into male.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.200 align:middle line:84%
This move through gender as
a bold and courageous act,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.630 align:middle line:84%
yet confusing to
many on the outside.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.310 align:middle line:84%
For more clarity,
we're going to engage

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.335 align:middle line:84%
in a more universal conversation
about sexuality today.

00:00:49.335 --> 00:00:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Lauren, it's so
good to meet you.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:51.410 align:middle line:90%
You have the most--

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.170 align:middle line:84%
I always take a breath
before the camera rolls,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.753 align:middle line:84%
and you have the
most beautiful energy

00:00:54.753 --> 00:00:56.020 align:middle line:90%
surrounding you, and in you.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.660 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really thrilled
to have you here.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so thrilled to get into
the topic of sexuality, which

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.820 align:middle line:84%
we normally don't do
on our shows here,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.120 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to be
looking at it at levels that

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.097 align:middle line:84%
are much more sublime than
what we ordinarily engage in.

00:01:10.097 --> 00:01:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>>LAUREN CIELO: It's
great to be here.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.586 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so first, if you
give us a little background,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.600 align:middle line:84%
for those who don't know
you, of your own story as--

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.620 align:middle line:84%
first, as an engineer
and a brainiac,

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.004 align:middle line:90%
into what you do today.

00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I did
start out as an engineer.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.320 align:middle line:10%
I was AT&T engineer
for quite some time.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.660 align:middle line:10%
And I just happened to stumble
onto a flyer at Whole Foods

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.670 align:middle line:10%
about a psychic institute.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And you know, looking back,
I had really been trying--

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.690 align:middle line:84%
I call it trying to have a
spiritual connection on Earth.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.700 align:middle line:90%
And so I-- drumming--

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I was in a woman's healing
circles, I walked fire--

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.820 align:middle line:84%
you know, I walked
the fire three times.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.160 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until I went
to that psychic institute

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.340 align:middle line:84%
that I really had my first, what
I call a spiritual experience

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.660 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with how you
psychically read-- you know,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.690 align:middle line:84%
how you align yourself
into your body.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And when that happened, I
realized, this is it for me.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.590 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up studying
for two years,

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and then I started my own
business, Golden Rose.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.870 align:middle line:90%
I've been so blessed.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.302 align:middle line:84%
I've had students and
clients all over the world.

00:02:14.302 --> 00:02:15.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of
the things I think

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.880 align:middle line:84%
is most interesting about
teaching someone to be psychic

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.600 align:middle line:90%
is, you already are.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.626 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:02:21.626 --> 00:02:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: It's just to kind
of pull your awareness--

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.500 align:middle line:84%
I think of myself as Jiminy
Cricket on your shoulder,

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.350 align:middle line:90%
going, psst.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.070 align:middle line:84%
That was a psychic
impulse you just got.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.170 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't stream
of consciousness.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.300 align:middle line:84%
So my business has
been doing very well.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:84%
I've been so blessed to be
on many shows like yours.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.520 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.580 align:middle line:84%
But no one's ever
asked me, really,

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.800 align:middle line:90%
to talk about gender or--

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.290 align:middle line:84%
we always talk
about psychic stuff.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everything else.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yes, everything else.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.040 align:middle line:84%
So I was so glad to get a
chance to talk about it.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
I don't know why.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just
listen intuitively,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.400 align:middle line:84%
and it came up that you
were the perfect person

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.620 align:middle line:84%
to have this conversation
with, because you can look

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.050 align:middle line:84%
at it from so many perspectives,
on such a complex level,

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.480 align:middle line:84%
including from the universal
and intuitive levels.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Exactly.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so how are
you on your own journey,

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.010 align:middle line:90%
before we begin?

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.634 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, well,
I'm about, really,

00:03:08.634 --> 00:03:11.080 align:middle line:84%
halfway through transitioning,
is what it's called.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And I've been on testosterone
for a year and a half.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:84%
I've had top surgery, which
is double mastectomies.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.640 align:middle line:90%
I had that six months ago--

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.370 align:middle line:90%
wonderful surgeon, great job.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.079 align:middle line:84%
You know, my body's becoming
much more how I envisioned it.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.120 align:middle line:84%
So I have, I guess, about
another year and a half

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.070 align:middle line:90%
before I'm fully done.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.435 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing is, my
first whiskers are gray.

00:03:32.435 --> 00:03:33.405 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:33.405 --> 00:03:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you waited
a little late in the game

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.090 align:middle line:90%
for this.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Waited a little long.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.209 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You don't
get a big black beard.

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Right, right.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.420 align:middle line:84%
But it's been a very
interesting process.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.970 align:middle line:84%
But I will say that I haven't
really freaked myself out yet,

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:44.770 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.430 align:middle line:84%
I haven't woken up or
had something change

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.520 align:middle line:90%
that freaked me out.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.939 align:middle line:84%
It seems that it's all
kind of been stepped,

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:53.980 align:middle line:90%
and I'm very comfortable.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.374 align:middle line:84%
Even as I've been
changing so much,

00:03:56.374 --> 00:03:57.790 align:middle line:84%
it's still very,
very comfortable.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.248 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that has to be
because you're so integrated

00:04:00.248 --> 00:04:02.050 align:middle line:90%
in who you are as a being--

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.580 align:middle line:90%
as a human being.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: That's probably true.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.685 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've watched
this personally,

00:04:05.685 --> 00:04:09.700 align:middle line:84%
and within my own family, where
my niece became my nephew,

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.740 align:middle line:84%
and watching the
transition she went to,

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.940 align:middle line:84%
and some of the really
challenging emotions

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.950 align:middle line:84%
that have been
waving through her

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.550 align:middle line:84%
in terms of her identity, which
really ended up being more

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.760 align:middle line:84%
like an effeminate
or gay man, you know,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.790 align:middle line:84%
and happy to be so-- happy
in his skin, finally.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.330 align:middle line:90%
But it was challenging.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: That's really common
in the transgender community.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.645 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know
what the statistics

00:04:35.645 --> 00:04:37.410 align:middle line:90%
are, but out of my personal--

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.960 align:middle line:84%
probably about 50% of females
that transition to male

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.900 align:middle line:90%
will end up being gay men.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Gay men, I know.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.780 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting,
because it's still

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.270 align:middle line:84%
bringing all the
feminine qualities

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.117 align:middle line:84%
into the man's express-- the
physical, manly expression.

00:04:53.117 --> 00:04:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: It's just
layers upon layers.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
layers and layers.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.460 align:middle line:84%
That's why I wanted to talk to
you about this, because it's

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:84%
so complex, and you're such
a beautiful soul to be able--

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and you're so expressive,
and you're so open.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I
wondered, and this only

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.360 align:middle line:84%
came in when I was
waking up this morning.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a question that
floated into my mind.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.670 align:middle line:84%
When you remove the breasts
from the female body,

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.240 align:middle line:84%
for example, in this process,
you had a good surgeon,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.640 align:middle line:84%
you're integrated
as a soul, is there

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.580 align:middle line:84%
any kind of spiritual healing
in that part of the process that

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.720 align:middle line:90%
takes place?

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, you know, I did
a lot of energy work before.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I'd been thinking
about transition for decades.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.700 align:middle line:90%
So I used the--

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:34.930 align:middle line:90%
I call them psychic tools.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.000 align:middle line:84%
So I used a lot of psychic
tools to already start

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.070 align:middle line:90%
changing my body.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.380 align:middle line:84%
So I worked on my
astral body, and so

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.720 align:middle line:84%
I tried to keep my shoulders
broad and my hips narrow.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, and did
your body start responding?

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh, yes.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.260 align:middle line:84%
I've always passed as
a male until I spoke.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And so that was-- that
was the thing that

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.055 align:middle line:84%
made it so difficult
for me, because I'm very

00:05:54.055 --> 00:05:55.630 align:middle line:90%
sensitive to people's energy.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And when they would sir me,
and then I would start to talk,

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.974 align:middle line:84%
there was this big retractions,
like, oh, I'm so sorry.

00:06:00.974 --> 00:06:02.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
and then confused.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.835 align:middle line:90%
That's what-- yeah, confused.

00:06:03.835 --> 00:06:06.760 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, so I
could feel their pain.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it started
with using the men's room,

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.550 align:middle line:84%
because the women just freaked
out when I would go in there.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.607 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:06:13.607 --> 00:06:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I just hated
to upset them so much,

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.240 align:middle line:90%
and the men didn't even notice.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.030 align:middle line:84%
So when my chest was
removed, I had already

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.880 align:middle line:90%
been energetically changing it.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of fact, it was
embarrassing to have breasts.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.830 align:middle line:84%
That's-- after looking back,
that's the word I would use.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:33.670 align:middle line:90%
It was embarrassing.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.040 align:middle line:90%
So I tried to hide, of course.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.530 align:middle line:84%
And when I think back
of all the mental energy

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:84%
that I used to
hide it, you know?

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.400 align:middle line:90%
This is how silly--

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.190 align:middle line:84%
walking into a stiff wind
would make me so uncomfortable.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.460 align:middle line:84%
I would want to take
another-- isn't that crazy?

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:49.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: So that's
the biggest thing,

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.607 align:middle line:84%
is I have so much more energy
not to be dealing with a body

00:06:55.607 --> 00:06:56.940 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't feel comfortable--

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The distract--

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, it
was distracting.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.130 align:middle line:90%
It was distracting.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and you're--
but you're also of such a high

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.250 align:middle line:84%
level of personal development
and spiritual development.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.310 align:middle line:84%
So I can see where that--
using all of these tools

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.349 align:middle line:84%
in advance, that
that makes sense.

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, you know, what
you mentioned about your niece,

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:18.340 align:middle line:84%
now nephew, being born
transgendered is very, very

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.390 align:middle line:90%
disorienting.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.300 align:middle line:84%
One thing, when I was born
in 1961, there were no words,

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.100 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.410 align:middle line:84%
When I did come out to my
parents, I think about--

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm 55 now, so about
53, and told them

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start
this process, you

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:84%
know, they were very
supportive, first of all.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And they asked me when I knew,
and I said, three or four.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.547 align:middle line:90%
I said, did I ever say anything?

00:07:42.547 --> 00:07:43.630 align:middle line:90%
And you don't my dad said?

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.940 align:middle line:84%
He goes, well, if you did,
we wouldn't have listened,

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.350 align:middle line:90%
which is true.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.100 align:middle line:84%
I do remember saying
things, though.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:49.900 align:middle line:90%
I definitely do.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Like, I didn't wear
a shirt, you know?

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.290 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be a little boy.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:57.760 align:middle line:84%
I was very much a
tomboy, athlete, so yeah.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
interesting, yeah.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, so in this
conversation, I thought

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.300 align:middle line:84%
we would start on
the broadest levels.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And then anything you
choose to interject,

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.980 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes
you might just--

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.250 align:middle line:84%
I know that, well, first
of all, set this up.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.056 align:middle line:84%
You have already talked to
the beings who guide you.

00:08:13.056 --> 00:08:13.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yes, I have.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:15.721 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so I did
something I normally

00:08:15.721 --> 00:08:17.800 align:middle line:84%
don't do because of this,
which was to supply you

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.200 align:middle line:84%
with the questions and
topics we'd be talking about

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.330 align:middle line:84%
so you could get the
downloads and not

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.320 align:middle line:84%
have to do it in any
inefficient way on camera.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.430 align:middle line:84%
So you'll be speaking
from your voice,

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.580 align:middle line:84%
but from the knowledge that
has been gifted you, blended

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.159 align:middle line:84%
with your own knowledge, and
understanding, and experience.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:34.450 align:middle line:90%
Is that a good way to say it?

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: That is a very good
way to describe it, yes.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, good.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.960 align:middle line:84%
So because of the
complexity that we're

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.820 align:middle line:84%
coming in with sexuality
today, which we'll

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.280 align:middle line:84%
go into more in
the human race, I

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.360 align:middle line:84%
wanted to really understand
more about how sexual--

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.850 align:middle line:84%
sexuality, and sexual
polarity, and gender

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.600 align:middle line:84%
works throughout the universe,
and different examples

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.531 align:middle line:90%
of how other species exist.

00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Right, well,
it really comes down

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.680 align:middle line:90%
to how complex the organism is.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.250 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking
about, I don't

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.900 align:middle line:84%
know, reptiles or
amphibians here, of course,

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.480 align:middle line:90%
there's not too much--

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.040 align:middle line:90%
you know, it's not too complex.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.530 align:middle line:84%
But in other inhabitable
places in the universe,

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.660 align:middle line:84%
they're even more complex
than we are-- the organisms.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.510 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we
have-- here on Earth,

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:26.770 align:middle line:84%
we have sex, which is either--
that's your chromosomes.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.790 align:middle line:84%
You're either XX or XY, and
we call that female and male.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And then we have all
the gender identities,

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.300 align:middle line:90%
which there are so many.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.410 align:middle line:90%
It's how you feel.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.290 align:middle line:84%
You might feel like a woman,
you might feel like a man,

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.050 align:middle line:84%
you might feel gender queer--
somewhere in between there--

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.140 align:middle line:84%
or you might feel gender
neutral, like nothing.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And then the third category
is who you're attracted to--

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.890 align:middle line:90%
sexuality.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:51.250 align:middle line:84%
So you can layer those
any way that you want to.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:57.330 align:middle line:84%
So some of the beings that
live out there actually

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:01.180 align:middle line:90%
contain both the--

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.017 align:middle line:90%
both parts needed to reproduce.

00:10:03.017 --> 00:10:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, so--
and it's not so much

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:84%
that they reproduce the
way maybe animals do here,

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.410 align:middle line:90%
like through parthenogenesis.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:13.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they
just separate, divide.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
really a way that they

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.990 align:middle line:90%
impregnate themselves.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:23.110 align:middle line:84%
So that, once you
take reproduction out

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.690 align:middle line:84%
of the interaction,
now you can really

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:28.110 align:middle line:90%
get into the differences.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.790 align:middle line:10%
So this is the image
that Ankaijia--

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.130 align:middle line:10%
that's my main
guide, say his name--

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:41.170 align:middle line:10%
he showed me human sexuality as,
like, a mixing board of music.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's just
all of these things

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.340 align:middle line:90%
that you can tune and change.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.160 align:middle line:84%
So I guess, the more
complex the organism,

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.920 align:middle line:84%
the bigger the mixing board,
might be the way to say it.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.740 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, there are a lot of
different ways in the universe

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.380 align:middle line:90%
to--

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.860 align:middle line:84%
But again, it seems like once
you take out reproduction,

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.056 align:middle line:90%
it's a--

00:11:01.056 --> 00:11:03.524 align:middle line:90%
the sky's the limit, really.

00:11:03.524 --> 00:11:04.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.810 align:middle line:84%
So was there any
specific culture

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.600 align:middle line:84%
you were shown, that
you could give by way

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.210 align:middle line:84%
of an example, of what that
was like, how that worked--

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:13.502 align:middle line:90%
self reproduction, so to speak?

00:11:13.502 --> 00:11:15.126 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, well,
it's almost like--

00:11:15.126 --> 00:11:16.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Were they humanoid?

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:17.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yes.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.205 align:middle line:84%
And it almost seems
like it's-- well,

00:11:19.205 --> 00:11:21.240 align:middle line:90%
it's so hard without context--

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.250 align:middle line:90%
almost like a marsupial.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, the way the baby
grows in the little pouch?

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.869 align:middle line:84%
So you kind of do
that to yourself.

00:11:27.869 --> 00:11:28.785 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:11:28.785 --> 00:11:31.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, so, and
that seemed to be--

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.570 align:middle line:84%
like, when I tried to
see where that was,

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:38.100 align:middle line:84%
it seemed to be really,
really far away from Earth.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think what's
really interesting is

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.320 align:middle line:84%
that, as this
reality does change,

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.480 align:middle line:84%
and we start to--
like, right now,

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.790 align:middle line:84%
the group agreement
on this Earth plane

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:52.020 align:middle line:84%
is not to have other
life in other planets.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.560 align:middle line:84%
The mainstream thought
is, there isn't, but we're

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.030 align:middle line:90%
starting to chip away at it.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.827 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as the group
agreement changes, and now,

00:11:59.827 --> 00:12:01.410 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden,
that's when, I guess,

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.180 align:middle line:84%
you have what people
call disclosure.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.240 align:middle line:84%
That's when, all of a sudden,
we'll meet other life forms.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And that is going to
change everything for us,

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:15.250 align:middle line:84%
because now, it may even take us
to another realm of the astral.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:16.740 align:middle line:90%
And I just need to say this--

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.480 align:middle line:90%
that the Earth isn't real.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.760 align:middle line:90%
The Earth is a video game.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.622 align:middle line:84%
And I changed my
avatar in the game.

00:12:22.622 --> 00:12:23.580 align:middle line:90%
That's about it, right?

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.204 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Some people
call it a school.

00:12:25.204 --> 00:12:26.540 align:middle line:90%
Some people call it a game.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:27.720 align:middle line:90%
Either way, yeah.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: So this game vibrates
to about the fourth level

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:32.650 align:middle line:90%
of the astral.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.110 align:middle line:90%
There's 12 layers.

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:84%
So once we get disclosure
or contact, what that's

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:42.510 align:middle line:84%
going to do, it's going to
move this replica, this game,

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:46.080 align:middle line:84%
up to the vibration of
a higher astral plane.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.650 align:middle line:84%
So that's really what, maybe,
some people call ascension.

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's
really why you're starting

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.630 align:middle line:90%
to see more people like me.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think I would have
come here if there wouldn't

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.950 align:middle line:90%
have been the chance to--

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.087 align:middle line:84%
and I don't really
think I'm male.

00:13:01.087 --> 00:13:02.170 align:middle line:90%
I don't think that at all.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.260 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm
somewhere in between.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.142 align:middle line:84%
But this physical
form allows me--

00:13:08.142 --> 00:13:09.600 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you what
it does, Regina.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.650 align:middle line:84%
It allows more of me to
get into this vessel.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:14.760 align:middle line:90%
It's all about grounding.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.150 align:middle line:84%
I know that sounds really
weird, but in the male anatomy,

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.402 align:middle line:84%
you tend to ground
from the testicles.

00:13:20.402 --> 00:13:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And in the female
anatomy, you tend

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.500 align:middle line:90%
to ground from the ovaries.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.500 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
kind of in between,

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.530 align:middle line:84%
it's very disorienting, and a
lot of my brothers and sisters

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.952 align:middle line:84%
do have mental and emotional
illness because of it.

00:13:30.952 --> 00:13:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, because
there's a high suicide

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:34.860 align:middle line:90%
rate, so a lot to take on.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I had the
great opportunity

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.420 align:middle line:84%
to speak at the Gender Odyssey
Conference in Seattle in 2015,

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:45.280 align:middle line:84%
and that was my only experience
with the transgender community,

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.430 align:middle line:90%
and it was hard.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.584 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is so
much pain and suffering.

00:13:50.584 --> 00:13:52.125 align:middle line:84%
So what we've done
at Golden Rose is,

00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:55.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't really interact with my
transgender siblings anymore.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.330 align:middle line:84%
We do like a bunch
of free meditations

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.900 align:middle line:84%
that come out every month,
and they just download, but--

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.780 align:middle line:84%
so I think the first
thing is, you've

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.620 align:middle line:84%
got to be very, very
strong to even entertain

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.400 align:middle line:84%
switching your gender,
because it's so disorienting.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.160 align:middle line:84%
But I do think that more and
more souls are coming here,

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.254 align:middle line:90%
because it is possible.

00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Like, higher level souls
that might have gone,

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:20.040 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I can't exist
in a female space,

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.980 align:middle line:84%
and I can't exist
in a male space.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.690 align:middle line:84%
I've got to be able
to flow through.

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So that is one of the reasons,
I think, why you see people,

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.820 align:middle line:90%
I guess, like me coming here.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and you
know, it's interesting.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.230 align:middle line:84%
About 30 years ago, I
was talking to the beings

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.780 align:middle line:90%
that I deal with, that guide me.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And they were telling me
about the-- at this time,

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.160 align:middle line:84%
AIDS was really
blossoming, right?

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.486 align:middle line:90%
And I asked about this.

00:14:46.486 --> 00:14:49.110 align:middle line:84%
I said, how come there's such a
phenomena, a growing phenomena?

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And I was living in the Castro
before that, in San Francisco,

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:52.590 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.960 align:middle line:84%
So I was very exposed to
the homosexual community,

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.700 align:middle line:90%
and my coworkers were.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.440 align:middle line:90%
And I said, it seems that--

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.640 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm in San Francisco.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.800 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, there's
a proliferation

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.830 align:middle line:84%
of people that are
openly stating and living

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.590 align:middle line:84%
their sexual preference
as homosexual.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, there's
actually a really very

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:13.140 align:middle line:90%
simple reason for this.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:18.190 align:middle line:84%
To have come in times
past, outside of very much

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:22.000 align:middle line:84%
more ancient times, was
a ticket, essentially,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.450 align:middle line:84%
to not only ridicule,
but even loss of life.

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:27.310 align:middle line:84%
So it really has
not been possible

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.830 align:middle line:84%
until the elevated thinking
occurred on the planet--

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.880 align:middle line:84%
the greater acceptance
occurred for these entities

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:37.270 align:middle line:84%
to come in and comfortably
be able to begin incarnating.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: It all goes back to
the male and female dynamic,

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:40.280 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.500 align:middle line:90%
Of control and domination.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.041 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Absolutely,
and we're going

00:15:43.041 --> 00:15:45.730 align:middle line:84%
to get into that, and some
of what that's brought about.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:48.790 align:middle line:84%
So taking it out to an
even more universal level,

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.750 align:middle line:84%
now, is that, if you
look at classical studies

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:56.740 align:middle line:84%
in physics, for example,
that our known--

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.386 align:middle line:84%
and I use the word
known universe,

00:15:58.386 --> 00:16:00.260 align:middle line:84%
because it might be
something quite different

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.760 align:middle line:84%
when you get beyond our level of
understanding as human beings--

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:08.860 align:middle line:84%
everything is
paired in polarity.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Electrons and protons, and
masculine, feminine, moon, sun,

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.720 align:middle line:90%
light, dark, you know?

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.290 align:middle line:90%
Heat, cold.

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:22.510 align:middle line:84%
So how does sexuality, in your
perspective, figure into this.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.790 align:middle line:84%
If you're coming into
a more neutral position

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:30.370 align:middle line:84%
within your body, how do these
kind of life-giving elements

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.400 align:middle line:90%
of polarity play out?

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, again, I think
it depends on the organism.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:41.410 align:middle line:84%
The lower evolved the organism,
the, again, less complicated

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:42.462 align:middle line:90%
reproduction is.

00:16:42.462 --> 00:16:44.420 align:middle line:84%
You may be able to do it
yourself, like a worm.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right, yeah

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: But
definitely, to get--

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:52.900 align:middle line:84%
it's all about getting a
really big genetic pool, see?

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we've got
to mate with others,

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.920 align:middle line:90%
so that we have this huge--

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.710 align:middle line:84%
and that's the mixing
board of changing

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:02.950 align:middle line:84%
all of the different
settings energetically.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.587 align:middle line:90%
So I feel--

00:17:04.587 --> 00:17:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, do you
still experience polarity

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.762 align:middle line:84%
within yourself, it's just
that you flipped your polarity?

00:17:09.762 --> 00:17:11.095 align:middle line:90%
And we'll use you as an example.

00:17:11.095 --> 00:17:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: That's a
really good question.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.780 align:middle line:84%
That's really-- you know,
this is what I think.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that male
and female is dichotomy.

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:17.889 align:middle line:90%
I don't think that.

00:17:17.889 --> 00:17:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It should
be complimentary.

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:21.069 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I
think, actually, male

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:22.903 align:middle line:90%
might be a subset of female.

00:17:22.903 --> 00:17:23.819 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:24.220 align:middle line:90%
Explain that.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: We see it with--
well, we see it with

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:25.990 align:middle line:90%
the chromosomes--

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:27.198 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm, that's true.

00:17:27.198 --> 00:17:29.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: --XX, XY,
something broke off.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:34.300 align:middle line:84%
We see it in the names for those
conditions-- female and male.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.370 align:middle line:90%
Male is a subset of female.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.320 align:middle line:84%
And we also see it in woman
and man, in those words.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.360 align:middle line:90%
So there's something going on.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying at all
that XX people are any way--

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.330 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's more beneficial
to have that container.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.100 align:middle line:90%
But I think that's where--

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.590 align:middle line:84%
this is what I think
happened in ancient times,

00:17:53.590 --> 00:18:00.620 align:middle line:84%
that when, you know, I think
of it as the goddess retreated.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.470 align:middle line:90%
The female divine pushed away.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And then women could
still generate that.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.550 align:middle line:90%
They had it within them.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:12.210 align:middle line:84%
But now we have our brothers
that have no access to goddess.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And then that's when
we started to see,

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:19.455 align:middle line:84%
like, monogamous marriage,
where you have to have a woman.

00:18:19.455 --> 00:18:21.870 align:middle line:90%
You need that energy.

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:25.044 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, there was
a lot of things that we--

00:18:25.044 --> 00:18:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
interesting, yes.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.001 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, we
did a lot of things

00:18:28.001 --> 00:18:32.100 align:middle line:84%
to really tamp down the female
energy, which is the healer.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.480 align:middle line:90%
And I'll say this.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And I know what's
really out there,

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:37.260 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you'll edit
this, I don't know.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.830 align:middle line:84%
But I think circumcision
is definitely--

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:42.615 align:middle line:90%
has hampered--

00:18:42.615 --> 00:18:44.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, don't get
me going on that one.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:45.970 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree more.

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And my son, when
he was a newborn,

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.300 align:middle line:84%
that was the practice
at Kaiser Permanente.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.760 align:middle line:84%
It was just assumed,
and it was a practice,

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and it's one of the few
regrets I have in my life,

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:58.050 align:middle line:84%
is allowing that
to have happened,

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:00.810 align:middle line:84%
because I think it has such
a deep, traumatic wound

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.417 align:middle line:84%
to the masculine that can
never really be recovered.

00:19:03.417 --> 00:19:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is, of course,
we need female orgasm.

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.630 align:middle line:90%
That's the healing energy.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.600 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately,
circumcision makes it

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.610 align:middle line:84%
to where, usually, the woman
doesn't have an orgasm.

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And I hate to say
it, but I think

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.460 align:middle line:84%
that might have been intended,
in some ways, down the way,

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:24.420 align:middle line:84%
because I know from my time,
women who are older than me--

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:28.695 align:middle line:84%
I'm 55-- I think they
were non-orgasmic a lot,

00:19:28.695 --> 00:19:31.230 align:middle line:84%
or they didn't even know
they were having an orgasm.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And that is the biggest energy--
when I read clairvoyantly,

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.160 align:middle line:84%
an orgasming Homo sapien
female is the highest vibration

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.270 align:middle line:90%
on Earth I can see.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: It is intense.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, it's
meant to bring a soul here.

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:48.480 align:middle line:84%
So I think that we've really
got to get back to that--

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.709 align:middle line:84%
about that energy
of healing, and how

00:19:51.709 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle line:90%
it can change everything.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, and
we're going to get

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:55.920 align:middle line:84%
into some of the social
implications of that, too.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.820 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of-- and I
don't mean polarization,

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:84%
but complimentary polarity, just
that allows the two to even be

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.360 align:middle line:84%
attracted to each other, to
come together and such, yeah--

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And so what I
think is that, first, you

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:84%
have self reproduction, and then
you get into two, like we are.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.600 align:middle line:84%
But then I think it
goes back to one,

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.329 align:middle line:84%
where you actually impregnate
yourself when you want to.

00:20:18.329 --> 00:20:19.620 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that kind of interesting?

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:19.980 align:middle line:90%
It is

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.528 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: But I also think that's
a different type of body--

00:20:22.528 --> 00:20:26.490 align:middle line:84%
not such a dense body,
because of genetics.

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:29.019 align:middle line:90%
We need that big, big pool.

00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You touched
on this a moment ago,

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.435 align:middle line:84%
when you were talking
about the healing

00:20:32.435 --> 00:20:33.854 align:middle line:84%
capability of the
feminine, which

00:20:33.854 --> 00:20:35.520 align:middle line:84%
is, we'll talk about
a little bit later,

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:38.170 align:middle line:90%
has been severely repressed.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And so what are the innate
spiritual attributes

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.550 align:middle line:84%
of the masculine and feminine
from that point of view?

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Perfect.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, spiritually,
we don't have gender.

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Spirit-- there's
only one energy.

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:52.980 align:middle line:84%
But when we go to
the soul level,

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:56.100 align:middle line:84%
it's very interesting,
because you'll pick the body,

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.750 align:middle line:84%
you'll pick the
place, and you'll

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:01.740 align:middle line:84%
pick the time that will allow
your higher self to experience

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.920 align:middle line:90%
what it wants to learn.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it might
be in a male body,

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:08.910 align:middle line:84%
in a certain time, in
a certain place, where

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:12.210 align:middle line:84%
whatever that experience
of being male is,

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:13.680 align:middle line:90%
that's what you're looking for.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And then other times, you might
incarnate in a female body,

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:18.780 align:middle line:84%
in another environment,
because that's

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.230 align:middle line:90%
what you're going to learn.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:21.630 align:middle line:84%
So when you think
about how we've

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:25.430 align:middle line:84%
been incarnating for the
last 2,000, 3,000 years,

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.420 align:middle line:84%
probably, everybody's
had a shot at both sides.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.870 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that
when we incarnate,

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:33.810 align:middle line:90%
we'll look and find the most--

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:36.770 align:middle line:84%
well, I don't want to say
perfect, but best circumstance

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.260 align:middle line:84%
to have those nuances
that we're looking for.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.080 align:middle line:84%
I really think that the
frequencies of energy

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.889 align:middle line:84%
are more nuanced
now than before.

00:21:43.889 --> 00:21:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hm, I agree.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And I think, maybe,
that's one reason why XX

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.280 align:middle line:90%
chromosome people--

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just
so touchy-feely.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can feel
everything, you know?

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.940 align:middle line:90%
And often, I've found--

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.710 align:middle line:90%
I used to do--

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:00.525 align:middle line:84%
I had a little hypnotherapy
clinic years ago.

00:22:00.525 --> 00:22:02.150 align:middle line:84%
I got my certification,
but it was just

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:04.420 align:middle line:84%
something I could always do
quite easily with people,

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.370 align:middle line:84%
and I worked a lot with past
lives-- people and past lives.

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I
noticed, though, is

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:12.530 align:middle line:84%
there would almost always
be some point at which they

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:16.880 align:middle line:84%
incarnated the opposite sex,
but tended to continue down

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.979 align:middle line:90%
one path or the other.

00:22:18.979 --> 00:22:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I do think that.

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:20.820 align:middle line:90%
I do think that.

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And I I'll tell you why,
because being in body

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:25.320 align:middle line:90%
is very vulnerable.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:32.309 align:middle line:84%
So once you get into one
type that you can fill up,

00:22:32.309 --> 00:22:33.350 align:middle line:90%
I think that's inviting--

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:34.317 align:middle line:90%
I think it's security.

00:22:34.317 --> 00:22:35.150 align:middle line:90%
That's what I think.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:35.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That makes sense.

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.430 align:middle line:84%
It's the familiar,
because I often

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.340 align:middle line:84%
wondered, why is it that
the last couple of thousand

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:44.060 align:middle line:84%
years of patriarchal
dominance, and the quashing

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.860 align:middle line:84%
of the feminine
essence on almost

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.150 align:middle line:90%
every level of expression--

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:51.380 align:middle line:84%
why would people like myself
have continued and continued

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.180 align:middle line:90%
to incarnate as female?

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:57.370 align:middle line:84%
Which most women you see
you have chosen to do that.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.396 align:middle line:84%
I know we didn't talk
about this off camera,

00:22:59.396 --> 00:23:01.520 align:middle line:84%
I didn't ask you to talk
to your guides about this,

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.429 align:middle line:84%
but I think you just
answered it, right?

00:23:03.429 --> 00:23:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yes, absolutely.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
mostly because that's

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:06.020 align:middle line:90%
what we're familiar with.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: That's what
we're familiar with.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It becomes, like,
an embedded role, so to speak,

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.890 align:middle line:90%
to play out in the Earth game.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, and I think
that it's all internal.

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Like, I don't know what it's
like to have XY chromosomes.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:21.920 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what
that feels like inside.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.100 align:middle line:84%
I do know what XX feels
like, and like I said,

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.770 align:middle line:84%
it's like filing
your fingernails

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:30.525 align:middle line:90%
down so you can crack a safe--

00:23:30.525 --> 00:23:31.400 align:middle line:90%
a lot of sensitivity.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.242 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:34.242 --> 00:23:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, how about the very
beginning of humanity?

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.907 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of stories about
the origins of the species,

00:23:38.907 --> 00:23:41.240 align:middle line:84%
and you talk a lot about
consciousness versus the animal

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.110 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:46.100 align:middle line:84%
How did this play out, to
start grooming ourselves

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.580 align:middle line:84%
to where we are now, in the very
beginning of the human species?

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I do think
that souls attempted

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:56.390 align:middle line:84%
to incarnate in the
highest life form on Earth,

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:58.990 align:middle line:84%
as that was evolving
and changing.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:04.200 align:middle line:84%
So I think that, at
the time that maybe we

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:08.340 align:middle line:84%
were a little more animal,
that that's when we really

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.380 align:middle line:90%
started to divide the sexes.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.330 align:middle line:90%
For one thing, menstruation--

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:15.585 align:middle line:84%
if you're a little hominid,
and half of you start bleeding,

00:24:15.585 --> 00:24:17.900 align:middle line:84%
well, guess who's going
to chase you down?

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Big tigers.

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:20.790 align:middle line:90%
So it had to separate out.

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:25.694 align:middle line:84%
So the women left
the immediate area,

00:24:25.694 --> 00:24:27.360 align:middle line:84%
where the children
and men were, so they

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.860 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't get gobbled up.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And what I was shown is
that they climbed up trees--

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.180 align:middle line:90%
so they hid up in the trees.

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And once they did that, they had
time alone, and they started--

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
they were talking,

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.069 align:middle line:90%
but they started communicating.

00:24:40.069 --> 00:24:41.610 align:middle line:84%
They started, I
think, what was maybe

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:45.180 align:middle line:90%
the basis of social interaction.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I also don't think that
there was that big a difference

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.880 align:middle line:90%
between male and female then.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:54.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think a lot of the
ferociousness of the female

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:56.090 align:middle line:90%
has been bred out--

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly,
because in those times,

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.610 align:middle line:84%
just like in a lot
of animal species,

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:02.230 align:middle line:84%
the females are
the ferocious ones.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They are the
hunters, huntresses.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I believe that.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And I also think that,
while a lot of theories,

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.359 align:middle line:90%
like the aquatic ape theory--

00:25:11.359 --> 00:25:12.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
ever heard that--

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:13.816 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes, I--

00:25:13.816 --> 00:25:15.850 align:middle line:90%
yes, I have read those books.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, so
that's what I think.

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:21.050 align:middle line:84%
When I ask my guides, it
is very close to that,

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:26.947 align:middle line:84%
that it was the female
essence that was separated out

00:25:26.947 --> 00:25:28.530 align:middle line:84%
from the rest of the
tribe that really

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:30.390 align:middle line:90%
started to change things.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think, in those
times, females were--

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:34.770 align:middle line:90%
well, they had babies.

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:36.080 align:middle line:90%
That was magic.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.312 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:25:38.312 --> 00:25:39.270 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: So it wasn't--

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it was till later
on when things started to get--

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It wasn't social.

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:44.850 align:middle line:84%
It was much later that the
social implications of this

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:45.270 align:middle line:90%
came in.

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:46.190 align:middle line:90%
Would you say, then--

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:47.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we just
laid the foundation

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:50.700 align:middle line:84%
for the more
primitive, basic ways

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.260 align:middle line:90%
in which we were functioning.

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And then, as we started
developing in societies,

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.550 align:middle line:84%
we started having
dysfunction and insecurities

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.020 align:middle line:90%
around our sexuality.

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
the inception of that?

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well I do think it's--
it has to do with divinity.

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:08.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, once humans
got to the point

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:12.420 align:middle line:84%
where they were going to
make something divine,

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.680 align:middle line:84%
I do think it was
female at first.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.960 align:middle line:84%
But when that changed-- and
I think it was energetic,

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.760 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.190 align:middle line:84%
The planet just moved
into a new place

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:22.990 align:middle line:90%
in space that was the energy.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:25.830 align:middle line:84%
So the female principle
got kind of squashed,

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:28.550 align:middle line:84%
and it hasn't done us any
good whatsoever-- not at all.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:32.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So here we are, acting
in a very natural fashion,

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:36.180 align:middle line:84%
in our most primitive
form-- early human species--

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.866 align:middle line:84%
and we're having sex, and
babies are popping out,

00:26:38.866 --> 00:26:41.490 align:middle line:84%
and women are climbing trees and
communicating with each other,

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's just accepted, as it
would be in any other species.

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.780 align:middle line:90%
And now we have--

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:51.780 align:middle line:84%
then started emerging
these kinds of anxieties,

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.630 align:middle line:84%
and insecurities,
and possessiveness,

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:55.650 align:middle line:90%
and such around sex.

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:57.066 align:middle line:84%
It's long before
there are really,

00:26:57.066 --> 00:26:58.470 align:middle line:90%
even, any societal structures.

00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:59.600 align:middle line:90%
How did that come about?

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: I think it
had to do with, again,

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:03.450 align:middle line:84%
trying to dominate the
female, and deciding

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.640 align:middle line:90%
who would impregnate who.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So once the social structure
did really start to pan out,

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:12.390 align:middle line:90%
and this female energy--

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:16.590 align:middle line:84%
this global female energy
was leaving, all of a sudden,

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:18.930 align:middle line:84%
you had to grab a
woman, and-- you know,

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:22.510 align:middle line:84%
so you could have that
great goddess energy.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and you
know, that's interesting.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:25.780 align:middle line:84%
This is going to
bring us up to--

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.488 align:middle line:84%
I'll go back to this
line of questioning,

00:27:27.488 --> 00:27:29.730 align:middle line:84%
but it's an observation
I've made before,

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:34.080 align:middle line:84%
and that is, when you look
statistically at men and women

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.110 align:middle line:84%
after divorce, the
men are much quicker

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:39.954 align:middle line:84%
to get into a new relationship
than are the women.

00:27:39.954 --> 00:27:41.370 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, the
women will even

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:43.520 align:middle line:84%
choose not to get into a
relationship again, ever

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.510 align:middle line:84%
or for a long time,
but the men are more

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:47.730 align:middle line:84%
compelled, within a very
short period of time,

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:50.880 align:middle line:84%
generally, if possible,
given the opportunity,

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.907 align:middle line:84%
to have an intimate
relationship with a woman again.

00:27:54.907 --> 00:27:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is what you
were speaking of?

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:58.031 align:middle line:10%
>>CIELO: Well, and
I do, and I think,

00:27:58.031 --> 00:28:01.080 align:middle line:10%
probably, the first
societies were matriarchal.

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.840 align:middle line:10%
So basically, you could have
as many babies as you wanted.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:07.590 align:middle line:84%
The land and property were
passed through the female line.

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:14.410 align:middle line:84%
But once we wanted to
captivate one woman,

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:17.950 align:middle line:84%
now, that really kind
of tied men's hands.

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:20.802 align:middle line:84%
Before, they could just go,
and have all that fun, and--

00:28:20.802 --> 00:28:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Be with
who they want to.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.843 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Be with-- And the woman
would decide whether he would

00:28:24.843 --> 00:28:28.710 align:middle line:84%
become a husband, which,
the word husbandry means--

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:32.290 align:middle line:84%
much different when you think--
talk about animal husbandry.

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:33.760 align:middle line:90%
That means to caretake.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.640 align:middle line:84%
Right So that's really what
the word husband means.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.780 align:middle line:90%
So I think that, once--

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:42.940 align:middle line:84%
and it did have to do with the
energy that became religion--

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.980 align:middle line:84%
once we started
dividing and conquering,

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:48.130 align:middle line:84%
and those kids
better belong to him,

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:50.620 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
changed it all.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.590 align:middle line:90%
That's what made sex bad.

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:56.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, there was now
really narrow restrictions

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:58.635 align:middle line:84%
on who could have sex
with who, and what

00:28:58.635 --> 00:29:00.760 align:middle line:84%
would be done with the
results of those-- you know,

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.080 align:middle line:90%
the babies that were born.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.080 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I think--

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.920 align:middle line:84%
I think it came from, first,
an energetic shift, that

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:09.444 align:middle line:84%
became a social shift,
that became a personal--

00:29:09.444 --> 00:29:11.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then gave birth
to religion, really.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Exactly.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.803 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is interesting,
because, you know, oftentimes,

00:29:14.803 --> 00:29:17.470 align:middle line:84%
as women, when we're
looking at the subject

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:20.450 align:middle line:84%
of the lowered,
or damaged, aspect

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:23.950 align:middle line:90%
of patriarchal structure, right?

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:28.060 align:middle line:84%
We look at the deleterious
effect it's had on females.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.970 align:middle line:84%
But it had just as
deleterious effect on men.

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, we lost-- you
hear about the pagan rituals

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.680 align:middle line:90%
and such--

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.770 align:middle line:84%
May 1st, and Beltane,
and all of that,

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:41.297 align:middle line:84%
which sounded like a
good time was had by all.

00:29:41.297 --> 00:29:43.770 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER] But then you take--

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:48.160 align:middle line:84%
you bring religion into it, and
the men had to, more or less,

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:52.870 align:middle line:84%
resort to either
shadowy behavior--

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:55.210 align:middle line:84%
you know, they were considered
to lack an integrity

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.550 align:middle line:84%
if they were to wander
away from the marriage.

00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Yet the people at the top did
whatever they wanted always,

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:03.096 align:middle line:84%
whether it was the clergy,
royalty, and so forth.

00:30:03.096 --> 00:30:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And these rules,
these restrictions,

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:06.910 align:middle line:84%
they just made it hard for both
of-- both male and female--

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:07.785 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:30:07.785 --> 00:30:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: --and the children
that come from the union, yeah.

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you were to look
at it from that point of view,

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:16.970 align:middle line:84%
the whole notion of
monogamy, really--

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:19.360 align:middle line:84%
there's heart monogamy,
there's physical monogamy--

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.810 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of different
levels of monogamy,

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:24.700 align:middle line:90%
from spirit to physical.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:29.001 align:middle line:84%
How would you see a healthy
human society function best?

00:30:29.001 --> 00:30:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: You know, well,
I think it would depend

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.860 align:middle line:84%
on the individuals in
the society-- of course,

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.210 align:middle line:84%
what's comfortable
for some might

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:35.470 align:middle line:90%
be not comfortable for others.

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:38.945 align:middle line:84%
But I think that this is
probably one of the revolutions

00:30:38.945 --> 00:30:40.570 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
see on the planet.

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:41.910 align:middle line:90%
We already are, right?

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's probably what
we're talking about today.

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.920 align:middle line:84%
So it is a really exciting
time to reconstitute--

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.500 align:middle line:84%
that's what I feel like,
is a reconstitution

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:54.460 align:middle line:84%
of energies that have been
divided out so abruptly,

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:55.720 align:middle line:90%
with razor--

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.620 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.730 align:middle line:90%
So I think we would all--

00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And with
cold-heartedness

00:30:58.850 --> 00:30:59.960 align:middle line:90%
and mean-spiritedness.

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, I think there's
a lot of things in relationship.

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:07.210 align:middle line:84%
I think there's the
energetic healing that

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:09.570 align:middle line:90%
comes from having sex together.

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:11.590 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
the heart feelings

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.170 align:middle line:84%
that you get when you're
really close to someone.

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:15.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
sex necessarily

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.700 align:middle line:90%
has to be a heartfelt thing.

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.530 align:middle line:84%
I think it could be
like running, you know?

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:22.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't really love
my running partner,

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.220 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to run
with them, you know?

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:25.670 align:middle line:90%
So I think that's huge--

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:26.470 align:middle line:90%
the gambit's huge.

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:28.847 align:middle line:84%
But the most important
thing is language.

00:31:28.847 --> 00:31:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:31.971 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, we've
got to be able to name

00:31:31.971 --> 00:31:33.650 align:middle line:90%
these nuanced energies.

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And I find myself
in readings all

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:39.390 align:middle line:84%
the time going, well, I'm going
to say this and then back off.

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to nibble
around the edges, I'll say.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And then I usually say it was
because I was an engineer,

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:47.450 align:middle line:84%
and I don't have
a huge vocabulary.

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:55.550 align:middle line:84%
But it'll take a long time to
describe an energy that's so--

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Complex.

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yes.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.310 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times, it just
takes a lot of communication,

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:01.746 align:middle line:90%
and maybe some new words.

00:32:01.746 --> 00:32:02.870 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we'll have new words.

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:05.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, transgender is huge.

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was one of the
things, when I was young--

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.520 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't wrap my
head around what I

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.980 align:middle line:90%
was, because there was no word.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.920 align:middle line:84%
So I think you'll see a lot more
vocabulary words coming out.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it does-- we need
to have new languaging so we

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:23.810 align:middle line:84%
can create more familiar
conceptual thinking on it.

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And the number-one
thing is, it's not a dichotomy.

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:31.950 align:middle line:84%
I think that the planet
is leaving dichotomy--

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:34.079 align:middle line:84%
left and right, black
and white, it's--

00:32:34.079 --> 00:32:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
becoming more nuanced.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Life is become more
refined and nuanced.

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: And I hate--

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.195 align:middle line:84%
and I may hate to say this,
but you got to be educated.

00:32:42.195 --> 00:32:45.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, read-- read
people or read books.

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:49.600 align:middle line:84%
But you just really
have to open your mind.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet we live
off of the collective

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.810 align:middle line:84%
of our subconscious mind,
incarnation after incarnation.

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:57.619 align:middle line:84%
So we have a couple
thousand years

00:32:57.619 --> 00:32:59.410 align:middle line:84%
of this current pattern
that we've been in,

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:00.970 align:middle line:84%
that we're just
now busting out of.

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:02.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And you know
what I think it is?

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.920 align:middle line:84%
I think-- I do
think that's true,

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.370 align:middle line:84%
but I also think
that it's our vessel.

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:09.670 align:middle line:84%
The body chakras and
aura are programmed.

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And each little
bit of information

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.830 align:middle line:90%
that you pick up along the way--

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:middle line:84%
oh, you throw like
a girl, you know?

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Those little things,
they're in you.

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:21.960 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of what I did
to break free of that

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.030 align:middle line:84%
is, I started to
release any programming.

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:28.350 align:middle line:84%
I want to make this
vessel the vibration

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:30.420 align:middle line:84%
where my higher self can
have the experiences it

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:31.740 align:middle line:90%
wants to have.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.450 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the last--

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:35.007 align:middle line:90%
I called it gender meltdown.

00:33:35.007 --> 00:33:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And I would go through it, you
know, maybe every three or four

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:38.230 align:middle line:90%
years, where I would--

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What happened?

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I'd really have
to look and go, are you a man

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.520 align:middle line:90%
or are you a woman?

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.580 align:middle line:90%
And it would terrify me.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.430 align:middle line:84%
The last one I had before I
finally decided was the worst.

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:50.590 align:middle line:84%
I thought, you
know, I'm panicking.

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:52.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a panic--
full panic attack.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:55.980 align:middle line:90%
So it takes time.

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And so all of that
hatred, that self-hatred,

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:02.580 align:middle line:84%
or thinking that
you're dirty, or that--

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:04.547 align:middle line:90%
it's programmed in.

00:34:04.547 --> 00:34:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Especially with women.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:06.630 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Exactly.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:08.796 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Self-loathing is
almost secondary to being

00:34:08.796 --> 00:34:09.960 align:middle line:90%
incarnated as a female.

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How did that happen?

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.088 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Well, I think it's--

00:34:14.088 --> 00:34:17.389 align:middle line:84%
I think it was from the
social context, absolutely.

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:22.500 align:middle line:84%
If we-- if XX chromosome
people have this wide array

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:26.310 align:middle line:84%
of energies they can run,
and then it's cramped down

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:30.840 align:middle line:84%
into only the things that
the ex-wives won't do--

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.719 align:middle line:84%
so instead of being at
the top, the female energy

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:34.960 align:middle line:90%
moved over to the side--

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.918 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, you mean
like dishes and cooking?

00:34:36.918 --> 00:34:39.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: So I do think it's
a disfavor for anyone running

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:46.260 align:middle line:84%
female energy not to
realize that everything

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.820 align:middle line:90%
is female energy.

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:49.215 align:middle line:90%
It all is.

00:34:49.215 --> 00:34:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's at the base.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.409 align:middle line:90%
It's the base-- mater--

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:54.121 align:middle line:84%
it's a base of the
material world.

00:34:54.121 --> 00:34:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: And it doesn't mean--

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:55.989 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: On a spiritual level.

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And right now on the
planet, anyone can run it.

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Like, my great-grandfather could
have never stopped the children

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:02.687 align:middle line:90%
from crying.

00:35:02.687 --> 00:35:04.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not that he didn't want to.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.220 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know how.

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Now my nephew, who's expecting
a little girl in August,

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:11.730 align:middle line:84%
he absolutely will
be able to do it.

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:14.550 align:middle line:84%
He can run female energy,
and he probably doesn't even

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:15.570 align:middle line:90%
know when he's doing it.

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the
anxieties, I think,

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:21.180 align:middle line:84%
that is one of those things
that has to be transformed

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:24.570 align:middle line:84%
is this deep feminine wound
and fear of abandonment.

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Because in past
times, the feminine

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:30.870 align:middle line:84%
was so hooked to the masculine
for basic survival, of course,

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:36.540 align:middle line:84%
as we understand our history,
they were quite replaceable.

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And you could be replaced
at the drop of a hat.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And usually, it just took
some-- a newer, or younger,

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:44.910 align:middle line:84%
or something woman to come into
the tribe, or to the scene,

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:47.429 align:middle line:84%
or to the circle socially,
and you would be--

00:35:47.429 --> 00:35:48.720 align:middle line:90%
you could be dropped like that.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.094 align:middle line:84%
Thus, all your
security dries up.

00:35:50.094 --> 00:35:54.330 align:middle line:84%
So women got into an
incredibly unhealthy patterns

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:56.850 align:middle line:84%
of trying to maintain
that thing they think

00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:58.579 align:middle line:90%
is going to be desired.

00:35:58.579 --> 00:36:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Can you please talk
about that a bit?

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the bane of
the feminine existence.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:06.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, the 2016 election
totally showed us that through

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:07.770 align:middle line:90%
all that hatred--

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:12.450 align:middle line:84%
that hatred of self, hatred of
feminine, we got what we got,

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:15.539 align:middle line:84%
which will change
things very quickly.

00:36:15.539 --> 00:36:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, we'll talk
about that in a minute

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.746 align:middle line:84%
and see what your guides
have had to say about that.

00:36:19.746 --> 00:36:21.840 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed one
of our interviewees

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.150 align:middle line:84%
named Belinda Womack--
lovely, lovely woman who

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:26.880 align:middle line:84%
speaks with the archangels
on a very high level.

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And she brought this up, the
election, this period of time.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what is the
opportunity in this?

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And she said, this is
serving as a purging

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.530 align:middle line:90%
of the mass subconscious.

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:44.460 align:middle line:84%
And then looking at it
a little bit further--

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.960 align:middle line:84%
and this isn't
about politics, this

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:49.350 align:middle line:90%
is about the human species--

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Donald Trump has no
filters when he speaks.

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:56.190 align:middle line:84%
So he speaks whatever
is in his subconscious.

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:57.170 align:middle line:90%
It just comes out.

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Stream of
consciousness, yeah.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.394 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And a stream
of consciousness which

00:36:59.394 --> 00:37:02.620 align:middle line:84%
has been incredibly offensive
to almost everybody,

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:04.680 align:middle line:90%
at one point or another.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.560 align:middle line:84%
But what it's almost
doing is serving,

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:11.610 align:middle line:84%
it seems, as a surrogate
for these same wounds that

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:13.950 align:middle line:84%
are unhealed, and
dark tendencies

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:15.720 align:middle line:90%
within our mass psyche.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:19.530 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, my guides say,
OK, well, you have the choice.

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:22.900 align:middle line:84%
You have the feather
or the brick.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:25.240 align:middle line:84%
So I guess, as a
collective, we thought

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:27.880 align:middle line:84%
we would get more forward
movement from a brick.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.827 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And we probably will.

00:37:29.827 --> 00:37:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Probably not
people like you and I.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, but at large--

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:36.520 align:middle line:84%
at large, there'll be more
movement, more action,

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.280 align:middle line:90%
reaction, action, reaction.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.490 align:middle line:84%
It's going to ping back and
forth so people can, I think,

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:45.670 align:middle line:84%
take a look at what's really
happening inside of themselves,

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:47.560 align:middle line:84%
because it all comes
back to that, right?

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:47.680 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Right.

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.390 align:middle line:84%
They're still in
competition to not

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:50.980 align:middle line:84%
be the one that gets
set to the side.

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:52.806 align:middle line:90%
They're still actively--

00:37:52.806 --> 00:37:54.597 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is a
deep programming in us.

00:37:54.597 --> 00:37:56.220 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Yes, absolutely.

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.227 align:middle line:90%
So I think--

00:37:57.227 --> 00:37:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It makes women
compete with each other--

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: In catty ways.

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --in catty ways.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.124 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: And not be close--

00:38:02.124 --> 00:38:04.420 align:middle line:90%
not be emotionally close.

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:07.060 align:middle line:84%
So I really think
that what's going

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:10.000 align:middle line:84%
to happen-- this is how I
think it metaphysically works.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.040 align:middle line:84%
You have all this
information in your field,

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.540 align:middle line:90%
and then you see something.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.660 align:middle line:84%
You get stimulated in some
way, and then that information

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:18.140 align:middle line:90%
starts to light up.

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:19.630 align:middle line:90%
You're looking at it.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So when I watch Donald Trump, I
light up like a Christmas tree.

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:25.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at those things
of, you know, come on, gals,

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.200 align:middle line:90%
take all your power back.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.360 align:middle line:90%
You can do it.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have
something, now, to react to.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:31.120 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Exactly.

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Reaction isn't
as refined as response.

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:36.170 align:middle line:84%
To respond to is
a different level,

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:38.240 align:middle line:84%
but reaction will
do for now, right?

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Exactly.

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And what I try to do, and I
think it's helped me maybe

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.750 align:middle line:90%
move forward, is any--

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:46.600 align:middle line:84%
this is how it used
to work at the water

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.670 align:middle line:90%
cooler in engineering.

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did
that work for you?

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:53.525 align:middle line:84%
Did you feel more male or
female during this time?

00:38:53.525 --> 00:38:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Boy, I was on
the outside, big time.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.025 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
just on the outside.

00:38:57.025 --> 00:38:59.590 align:middle line:84%
So you didn't necessarily
go through some of these--

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:02.320 align:middle line:84%
the camaraderie of the
guys about the women.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.940 align:middle line:84%
But you also didn't
necessarily go

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:07.100 align:middle line:84%
through that kind of catty
and competitive aspect

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:07.900 align:middle line:90%
that women do.

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Exactly.

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:10.448 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that
would really bother me

00:39:10.448 --> 00:39:14.020 align:middle line:84%
was when there would be,
you know, blonde jokes.

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.995 align:middle line:84%
Blonde jokes drove me
crazy, because they

00:39:15.995 --> 00:39:16.870 align:middle line:90%
weren't blonde jokes.

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:18.700 align:middle line:90%
They were blonde woman jokes.

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And so I would hear them, and I
would get so upset, and I was--

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:24.406 align:middle line:90%
I was a bitch.

00:39:24.406 --> 00:39:25.780 align:middle line:84%
I just said what
I thought, and--

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:26.988 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How'd that go down?

00:39:26.988 --> 00:39:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Well, um--

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:32.350 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] --not
so well at times.

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:35.230 align:middle line:84%
But what I realized,
metaphysically,

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:38.950 align:middle line:84%
what I was doing is, I was
contracting in these people

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:42.670 align:middle line:84%
to poke at my issues
with being female.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:45.850 align:middle line:84%
So they would say something,
and I would just go ballistic.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:48.460 align:middle line:84%
So what I did, I started
to do, is say, OK, well I'm

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:51.200 align:middle line:84%
not going to confront
them anymore.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:53.364 align:middle line:84%
Once they light me
up, is what I call it,

00:39:53.364 --> 00:39:55.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go off
to my altar, and I'm

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:58.510 align:middle line:84%
going to say, OK, guides,
that information in my space,

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:02.690 align:middle line:84%
that's lighting up when they say
that, I want you to remove it.

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And so over time, I never
heard any more blonde jokes.

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why was because I
didn't get any more healing out

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:10.290 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:10.970 align:middle line:90%
I had already shifted.

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
they-- it just started

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.216 align:middle line:84%
dissipating within
your coworkers.

00:40:13.216 --> 00:40:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: So it-- yeah, and so
if I did hear anything like it,

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:19.000 align:middle line:84%
instead of going, I can't
believe you, I would go,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.660 align:middle line:84%
oh, you must have a problem with
women, that you would say that.

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.460 align:middle line:90%
I didn't light up anymore.

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:28.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's how I
think women today

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.920 align:middle line:84%
can start to take
back their power,

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:34.630 align:middle line:84%
is every single time a man
makes you feel less than,

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.460 align:middle line:90%
is use your guides and angels.

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Remove that information, and
then the next time somebody

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:41.237 align:middle line:84%
comes at you, you
won't feel that way.

00:40:41.237 --> 00:40:42.820 align:middle line:84%
You'll just be like,
oh, gosh, his mom

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:44.960 align:middle line:90%
didn't teach him very well.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.500 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, it's about
them and not about you.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.083 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then
how would you guide

00:40:49.083 --> 00:40:51.440 align:middle line:84%
women who are in a
relationship of some kind--

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.320 align:middle line:84%
new relationship,
old relationship--

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.380 align:middle line:84%
but who have this
baseline subconscious fear

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:58.450 align:middle line:90%
of abandonment on some level?

00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:00.057 align:middle line:84%
Like their world's
going to be rocked,

00:41:00.057 --> 00:41:01.390 align:middle line:90%
or they're going to be replaced?

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:02.470 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I
would think-- and I'm

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:04.000 align:middle line:84%
very good at
relationships, personally--

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.440 align:middle line:84%
but I would think,
go to your partner

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.460 align:middle line:84%
and tell them what
you're thinking,

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.126 align:middle line:84%
and see if they're
on board, because you

00:41:08.126 --> 00:41:09.560 align:middle line:90%
might have to jump ship.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.965 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and I do think that,
with the country, the way

00:41:12.965 --> 00:41:15.340 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be for the next
four years, a lot of people

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.170 align:middle line:84%
may look at their
own personal life

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:18.937 align:middle line:84%
and maybe jump
ship a little bit.

00:41:18.937 --> 00:41:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So I would start by
talking to your partner,

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:22.720 align:middle line:84%
and telling them how you feel,
and seeing if they're on board.

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.670 align:middle line:84%
But then you really are going
to have to take care of yourself

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:25.770 align:middle line:90%
and do your own energy work.

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:27.269 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You are,
and you also have

00:41:27.269 --> 00:41:30.130 align:middle line:84%
to allow yourself to be
very vulnerable in doing so.

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:32.140 align:middle line:84%
These aren't things
we talk about anymore.

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:34.300 align:middle line:90%
They're so embedded within--

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.180 align:middle line:84%
it's just part of a
subtle, little discomfort

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:39.670 align:middle line:84%
in the landscape
of feeling, right?

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And to bring it to the surface
and understand the antiquity

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:46.347 align:middle line:90%
behind that is a--

00:41:46.347 --> 00:41:47.680 align:middle line:90%
because I've been through that--

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.570 align:middle line:90%
is a very vulnerable process.

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:51.197 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And it could
be very volatile.

00:41:51.197 --> 00:41:53.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And can be very
volatile, and it can be very--

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:56.410 align:middle line:84%
if you're lucky, and you're
in a wonderful relationship,

00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:58.970 align:middle line:90%
incredibly bonding and healing.

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:01.869 align:middle line:84%
And you can go
deeper and deeper.

00:42:01.869 --> 00:42:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And I think, if
you have a lot of energy

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:06.160 align:middle line:84%
that you have to push through--
that's what I call it.

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:09.210 align:middle line:84%
It feels like I push through
energy to get to things.

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:11.620 align:middle line:90%
You know, when I left home, I--

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:13.770 align:middle line:84%
obviously, I was
under a lot of duress.

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:14.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, and I had
a huge emotional outburst.

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:20.620 align:middle line:90%
And I had never--

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:22.940 align:middle line:90%
we didn't have emotions.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:25.310 align:middle line:90%
So I had this huge release.

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:28.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you were to
watch me, it was hysterics.

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:30.450 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, I'm broken.

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:31.250 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:32.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm crazy.

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't realize, and I
don't think a lot of people

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:38.270 align:middle line:84%
realize that that's the way
you get through the energy.

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:42.950 align:middle line:84%
If it's a lot, and if it's
really stymieing who you are,

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:46.207 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have eruption
after eruption, but it's OK.

00:42:46.207 --> 00:42:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It needs to come out--

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:47.870 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: It needs to come out.

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:50.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --just like
that mass subconscious

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.540 align:middle line:90%
has to be expressed.

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:54.654 align:middle line:84%
And if Donald Trump is
expressing it for people,

00:42:54.654 --> 00:42:56.570 align:middle line:84%
so they can just kind
of ride on it until they

00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:58.360 align:middle line:84%
get to feel it in
all its expressions,

00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.720 align:middle line:90%
then that's a good thing.

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I agree, I agree.

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:03.625 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there
is good or bad.

00:43:03.625 --> 00:43:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
no, I understand.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.251 align:middle line:84%
There's just opportunity
for growth and learning.

00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: And experience.

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:09.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
it-- and experience.

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:09.800 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.633 align:middle line:84%
So what I was talking
about, about that kind

00:43:11.633 --> 00:43:14.170 align:middle line:84%
of deep psychic wound
within the feminine,

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:16.500 align:middle line:90%
the masculine version of it--

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:17.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a man.

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:18.890 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been
one, much, at all,

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:20.600 align:middle line:84%
but I'm just
guessing, would have

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.450 align:middle line:84%
to do with the notion of having
to be the one that knows,

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and is in control, and can
manage things, and take

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:27.620 align:middle line:84%
the responsibility
for everyone, which

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:30.740 align:middle line:84%
slipped over into dominance
in a lot of cases.

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.390 align:middle line:84%
But from your
point of view, what

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:34.310 align:middle line:84%
does that burden,
that secret burden

00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:38.240 align:middle line:84%
within the man that you're
aware of, look like?

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.060 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I think
chromosomally, they know--

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:43.700 align:middle line:84%
they know that
something broke off.

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:44.825 align:middle line:90%
And so, could you imagine--

00:43:44.825 --> 00:43:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
overcompensation,

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:47.042 align:middle line:90%
all the control, or--

00:43:47.042 --> 00:43:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I
think it's unfair.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.655 align:middle line:84%
And I think the most
unfair is alpha males.

00:43:50.655 --> 00:43:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Here, we have
stripped a human from fear.

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:57.267 align:middle line:84%
I was reading-- I very rarely
read alpha males, to tell you

00:43:57.267 --> 00:43:58.850 align:middle line:84%
the truth, but I
remember reading one,

00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:00.657 align:middle line:84%
and he said, why
is this happening?

00:44:00.657 --> 00:44:01.490 align:middle line:90%
Why can't I do this?

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And he had this
whole laundry list.

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And every single time he asked
a question, his higher self

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:07.890 align:middle line:84%
said, I'm afraid, I'm
afraid, I'm afraid.

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:08.690 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:08.965 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:44:08.965 --> 00:44:09.240 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: So by the time he
got done doing his dump,

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:12.735 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, honey,
you're afraid.

00:44:12.735 --> 00:44:13.850 align:middle line:90%
And you know what he said?

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:16.070 align:middle line:84%
He goes, I'm not
afraid of anything.

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:17.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow, what a program.

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: So yeah, so the
energy-- he doesn't even

00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:20.020 align:middle line:90%
know the energy.

00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:21.840 align:middle line:90%
He calls it something else.

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's
courage or something--

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:24.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:25.940 align:middle line:90%
But it's fear.

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:27.110 align:middle line:90%
It's 100% fear.

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And we and then we push him
right out onto the front line.

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:33.905 align:middle line:84%
It's terrible-- it's a terrible
thing to do to a human.

00:44:33.905 --> 00:44:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, that brings
up a good question.

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.940 align:middle line:84%
From the various readings
you've done through time,

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:40.698 align:middle line:84%
is war going to become
obsolete in the human species?

00:44:40.698 --> 00:44:41.614 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Gosh, I hope.

00:44:41.614 --> 00:44:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I hope too.

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:43.863 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: But I'll tell you what.

00:44:43.863 --> 00:44:48.110 align:middle line:84%
It really comes down
to how you get growth.

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're moving
from growth through conflict

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:53.510 align:middle line:90%
to growth through curiosity.

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That would be a
huge evolution for humanity.

00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:56.863 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: I think it would.

00:44:56.863 --> 00:44:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And we already see it, like,
with Donald Trump, right?

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:02.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's not
hurting me physically,

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:04.700 align:middle line:84%
but I hear the things
he says, and I light up.

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:06.950 align:middle line:84%
So I'm getting a great
healing, but there's

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:09.920 align:middle line:90%
no hand-to-hand combat.

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:12.010 align:middle line:84%
So I do think that
we will move past it,

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:13.430 align:middle line:90%
but I'll tell you what.

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:15.230 align:middle line:90%
The Earth is dividing.

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:18.717 align:middle line:84%
We all are not going to
incarnate in the same space.

00:45:18.717 --> 00:45:21.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, that's interesting
you should bring it up.

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:22.670 align:middle line:84%
It's something I
never talk about,

00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:24.772 align:middle line:84%
but I've been aware
for the last 30 years.

00:45:24.772 --> 00:45:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And every now and
then, I'll just kind of

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:28.970 align:middle line:84%
allude to it a little bit
by way of support of someone

00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:30.850 align:middle line:90%
else who's come up with it.

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:33.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a scenario that I've
known about for a long time,

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and it's absolutely
fascinating, because it

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:41.120 align:middle line:84%
has to do with our
regression or progression

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:44.940 align:middle line:84%
on a spiritual-frequency-based
level, just as you speak of.

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:46.945 align:middle line:84%
And it's this kind of
dual-Earth scenario.

00:45:46.945 --> 00:45:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And
metaphysically, what

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.810 align:middle line:84%
it would look like is,
this Earth is, like I said,

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:54.980 align:middle line:84%
is a replica of level
four of the astral.

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And on level four, you
get all of your growth

00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:58.790 align:middle line:90%
through friends and family.

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:01.880 align:middle line:84%
So Homo sapiens are the
most vicious, and yet

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.200 align:middle line:90%
the most social, animals.

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.990 align:middle line:90%
So we do this.

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:11.180 align:middle line:84%
So the next vibration up, we
won't do that to get growth.

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:13.240 align:middle line:90%
We'll just go, oh, who are you?

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Oh, wow, you just changed
me through curiosity.

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:20.565 align:middle line:84%
But it does mean moving
up the chakra system.

00:46:20.565 --> 00:46:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:22.730 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:24.380 align:middle line:90%
I want to go to the subject of--

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:26.860 align:middle line:84%
you brought it up earlier,
about females and orgasm--

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:30.080 align:middle line:84%
women and orgasms,
and the potential--

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:31.730 align:middle line:84%
looking at it,
your guides talking

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:35.150 align:middle line:84%
about this on a really
energetic level,

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:39.320 align:middle line:84%
about the potentials
that are available to us

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.420 align:middle line:90%
during human orgasms.

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:45.740 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, I think it's
important to stay in that

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:46.770 align:middle line:90%
field--

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:51.230 align:middle line:84%
in that orgasmically generated
energy field-- stay in there.

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:53.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't know what
other people's practices are,

00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:56.260 align:middle line:84%
if you just get it
done and get up.

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:58.702 align:middle line:84%
But lay in it, and even
use it with intention.

00:46:58.702 --> 00:46:59.660 align:middle line:90%
Just like when people--

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:01.159 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That was
my next question.

00:47:01.159 --> 00:47:02.196 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:47:02.196 --> 00:47:04.237 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, well, people
go to their yoga mats

00:47:04.237 --> 00:47:05.360 align:middle line:90%
with intention, you know?

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.690 align:middle line:84%
So I think, whether
you're with someone else

00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:11.600 align:middle line:84%
or whether you're just
generating the orgasmic energy

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.670 align:middle line:84%
yourself, do it
with mindfulness,

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:16.250 align:middle line:84%
just like a spiritual
person would do anything.

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:19.670 align:middle line:84%
But that energy, I'm telling
you, it can it can heal you.

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:21.010 align:middle line:90%
It can heal the world.

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, I-- years
ago, I was in Europe,

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:28.690 align:middle line:84%
in the mid-'80s,
doing a series on--

00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:31.180 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't called energy
medicine at the time,

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:33.550 align:middle line:84%
but it was on color
therapy acupuncture.

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:36.060 align:middle line:84%
I was going to the top people
in the world with my camera,

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:36.860 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:38.810 align:middle line:90%
My cameraman, doing this--

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:40.860 align:middle line:84%
of course, it was about
20, 30 years too early.

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:42.630 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, as
I was doing this,

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:44.700 align:middle line:84%
I came into contact
with an anthroposophist

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:50.460 align:middle line:84%
who had been connected with
Rudolf Steiner University named

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Theo Gimbel, a British
man, who handed me

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:56.010 align:middle line:84%
this little booklet on just
what you were speaking of,

00:47:56.010 --> 00:48:00.810 align:middle line:84%
about the incredible
creative potential of two

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:03.840 align:middle line:90%
partners having--

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:07.290 align:middle line:84%
setting a very clear
intention together for-- it

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:08.170 align:middle line:90%
could be anything.

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:10.830 align:middle line:84%
It could be for anything
in the world at all.

00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:13.064 align:middle line:84%
It could be for their own
self-healing or growth,

00:48:13.064 --> 00:48:14.730 align:middle line:84%
or for that of someone
else, or for that

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:17.670 align:middle line:84%
of a whole solar system,
during the process

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:19.009 align:middle line:90%
of having an orgasm.

00:48:19.009 --> 00:48:21.300 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And if the male and
female can have the orgasm

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:24.360 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, the
female energy erupts

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.730 align:middle line:84%
into the universe, and the
male energy drives right

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:27.680 align:middle line:90%
into the Earth--

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: --grounds it right in.

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:32.190 align:middle line:90%
So you know, as above is below.

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So it would be
well worth our time

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:38.640 align:middle line:84%
to spend more time studying
that and working that energy.

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet, at
this time in history,

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:43.450 align:middle line:84%
the boys have become
more and more withdrawn,

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:46.020 align:middle line:90%
more addicted to technology.

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:49.470 align:middle line:84%
The girls have become
more ambitious--

00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:53.310 align:middle line:84%
college rates, job entry,
everything is now skewed--

00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:55.740 align:middle line:84%
starting to skew pretty
heavily toward the female.

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And so what have your guides
had to say about that?

00:48:59.790 --> 00:49:03.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the boys are just
kind of lost right now.

00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:07.209 align:middle line:84%
There are no real models for
what it means to be a man.

00:49:07.209 --> 00:49:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I think that's
one reason why so many boys are

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:13.469 align:middle line:84%
raised by their mothers
now, because if you look

00:49:13.469 --> 00:49:15.510 align:middle line:84%
at the difference between
somebody raised by just

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:16.400 align:middle line:90%
a woman--

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.887 align:middle line:84%
a male-- versus somebody--
a male raised by--

00:49:19.887 --> 00:49:20.970 align:middle line:90%
they're totally different.

00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:22.370 align:middle line:90%
They're much more verbal--

00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:24.119 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they talk,
talk, talk, talk, talk.

00:49:24.119 --> 00:49:25.660 align:middle line:90%
They can express themselves.

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:27.250 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
it-- mothering.

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:28.875 align:middle line:84%
I think mothering
the next generation--

00:49:28.875 --> 00:49:30.900 align:middle line:90%
and it's already happening.

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So in other words, not
having any dominant influence

00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:37.650 align:middle line:84%
for this little
window of history,

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:40.770 align:middle line:84%
by the old patriarchal
view of masculinity,

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:44.190 align:middle line:84%
you believe, is actually
helping them grow new parts that

00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:47.110 align:middle line:84%
will be helpful in reintegrating
back with the girls

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:47.910 align:middle line:90%
again one day?

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Oh, absolutely,
because think of--

00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:53.910 align:middle line:84%
I heard this thing on
NPR about masculinity,

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and it said that a lot of the
post-World War II masculinity

00:49:58.170 --> 00:49:59.400 align:middle line:90%
was based on that war.

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:06.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And now, like, men
have more beauty products.

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:07.590 align:middle line:90%
Men wax their eyebrows.

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:10.590 align:middle line:84%
My brother asked me 10 years
ago-- hey, is that guy gay?

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:12.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, I can't tell.

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:15.000 align:middle line:90%
Gaydar is dead.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.320 align:middle line:84%
So I do think the youngest
generation of men-- you know,

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:19.527 align:middle line:90%
19 through 25--

00:50:19.527 --> 00:50:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Called
metrosexual a lot of times.

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Metrosexuals,
they are definitely

00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:27.660 align:middle line:84%
running a full set of
female energy, overlaid

00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:29.120 align:middle line:90%
to a male body.

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And that gets
really interesting.

00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:33.429 align:middle line:84%
That's why all the labels are
skewing, like we said before.

00:50:33.429 --> 00:50:35.095 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's I
wanted to talk about,

00:50:35.095 --> 00:50:37.770 align:middle line:84%
is, where do you see us going
from here, considering what

00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:40.380 align:middle line:84%
you've just said, where
the men are developing

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:45.420 align:middle line:84%
more feminine abilities,
access to the feminine-- more

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:47.400 align:middle line:84%
nurturing aspect of
themselves, for example,

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.074 align:middle line:90%
or more connected with beauty?

00:50:49.074 --> 00:50:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, I
think, socially--

00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:52.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, could you
imagine if everyone--

00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:55.830 align:middle line:84%
you really couldn't tell
what gender you were?

00:50:55.830 --> 00:50:59.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the
fashions, the makeup,

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.080 align:middle line:84%
unless somebody
was bulging really

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:03.990 align:middle line:84%
big in one part or the other,
you really couldn't tell?

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:07.650 align:middle line:84%
You were just interested in
how their energy overlaid

00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:09.600 align:middle line:90%
their body in some way.

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.666 align:middle line:84%
So that becomes so
much more interesting.

00:51:11.666 --> 00:51:13.290 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't even
know until the moment

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:15.570 align:middle line:84%
whether you could possibly
conceive with that person

00:51:15.570 --> 00:51:16.800 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.530 align:middle line:84%
So that really separates
out sexual attraction

00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:20.650 align:middle line:90%
from reproduction.

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:23.980 align:middle line:84%
It's completely separate--
separating out, yeah.

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're
talking about a finer

00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:28.590 align:middle line:84%
type of, if you want to
call it, soul attraction.

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Absolutely.

00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:31.657 align:middle line:90%
It's that huge mixing board.

00:51:31.657 --> 00:51:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And the mixing board
gets bigger and bigger.

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Before, it was two things--

00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:35.660 align:middle line:90%
male or female.

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And now-- and that's not nuanced
enough for people like you

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and I. I mean, you run
a lot of male energy.

00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:44.040 align:middle line:84%
You decide what to create,
and then you create it,

00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:46.260 align:middle line:84%
and that's really the
male and female energy--

00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:51.230 align:middle line:84%
the male energy directs, and
the female energy creates.

00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I decide what
I'm going to create.

00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:55.710 align:middle line:84%
I decide what I'm going
to create, and I do it.

00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:56.670 align:middle line:90%
And so do you.

00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:57.540 align:middle line:90%
And so do men--

00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:58.734 align:middle line:90%
biological men.

00:51:58.734 --> 00:52:00.150 align:middle line:84%
But I think, really,
understanding

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:03.060 align:middle line:84%
the energy of male and
female-- and it's not

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:04.610 align:middle line:90%
masculine and feminine.

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:06.080 align:middle line:90%
That is a social context.

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:07.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And how about-- we just
have a few minutes left.

00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:12.299 align:middle line:90%
How about yourself?

00:52:12.299 --> 00:52:14.340 align:middle line:84%
You've been through all
these incredible changes,

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and you're so disarmingly
and beautifully open,

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:20.700 align:middle line:84%
on all levels, in
talking with us.

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And what do you see
as your soul's mission

00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:26.190 align:middle line:90%
in this lifetime?

00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:27.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh, god.

00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What does that look
like from above, so to speak?

00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Well, like I
said, more of Lauren

00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:33.215 align:middle line:90%
is coming into this vessel.

00:52:33.215 --> 00:52:35.777 align:middle line:90%


00:52:35.777 --> 00:52:37.860 align:middle line:84%
It's grounded-- you know,
I come from electronics,

00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:41.230 align:middle line:84%
so my grounding-- my
ground was floating.

00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:45.290 align:middle line:84%
So when a signal isn't
grounded, it bops up and down,

00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:47.650 align:middle line:84%
and you don't-- you might
get a lot of static.

00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:50.840 align:middle line:84%
You really can't get it to
move in a predictable fashion--

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not
as cohesive, right.

00:52:52.590 --> 00:52:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Exactly.

00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:58.610 align:middle line:84%
So by shifting this form through
hormones-- and the surgery,

00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:02.169 align:middle line:84%
I think that was more for
my comfortability, you know?

00:53:02.169 --> 00:53:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Could you have done
this without the surgery,

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:07.570 align:middle line:84%
or would it have just had
that whole distraction

00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:09.262 align:middle line:84%
of that embarrassment
all the time?

00:53:09.262 --> 00:53:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Actually, it
was the top surgery

00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:11.960 align:middle line:90%
that got me down the path.

00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:13.668 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't sure I would
go on testosterone.

00:53:13.668 --> 00:53:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK, OK.

00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Yeah, but
actually, the way

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:17.896 align:middle line:84%
it was, it was much
easier to get testosterone

00:53:17.896 --> 00:53:20.340 align:middle line:84%
than it was to get top surgery,
through the medical thing,

00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:21.140 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:24.770 align:middle line:84%
But I think, when more
of me is in this vessel,

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:26.690 align:middle line:90%
then I think I'll know.

00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:30.170 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like how
we were talking before.

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:33.800 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have words
to describe a concept--

00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:36.020 align:middle line:84%
like, we were talking
about reading.

00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And like sometimes,
I read stuff--

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:39.020 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea what it is.

00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:40.520 align:middle line:90%
I have no context.

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:44.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's how I feel about
being in body at this time.

00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:47.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, a couple more years,
and I think, as much of me

00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:50.360 align:middle line:84%
can get into this
vessel as possible,

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:53.910 align:middle line:84%
and I still have some things
that get in the way of my work.

00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:55.000 align:middle line:90%
And I think those things--

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.890 align:middle line:84%
for one thing, I don't
type very fast, you know?

00:53:58.890 --> 00:54:02.240 align:middle line:84%
So I think, you know,
more of me will come in,

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:05.750 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll really
be cooking, to see

00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:07.660 align:middle line:90%
what I'm really here to do.

00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:09.410 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's about
freedom, don't you?

00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do, I do.

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Just like, to just
let everybody break down

00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:12.560 align:middle line:90%
those walls.

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:15.018 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let everyone define
themselves the way they wish.

00:54:15.018 --> 00:54:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Be it patriarchal,
masculine, you

00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:19.140 align:middle line:84%
know, uber-feminine,
it doesn't matter.

00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Exactly.

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:21.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or whether
it's anything in between,

00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:23.180 align:middle line:84%
to be free to express
what it is you

00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:25.340 align:middle line:84%
want to express in
this incarnation.

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: And to be loving and
communicative like how you feel

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:29.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm so open with the dialogue.

00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:34.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not scary-- it's
not scary in any way.

00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:35.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's very true.

00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:37.310 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little
bit, because we just

00:54:37.310 --> 00:54:39.140 align:middle line:90%
have a couple of minutes left--

00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:41.150 align:middle line:84%
your profession,
what you do is, you

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:43.680 align:middle line:84%
help people connect with
that deeply intuitive aspect

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:44.480 align:middle line:90%
of self.

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:46.563 align:middle line:84%
Talk about this a little
bit, and really, what you

00:54:46.563 --> 00:54:47.580 align:middle line:90%
have to offer people.

00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Oh, thanks.

00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Through
the Golden Rose.

00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CIELO: Right,
through Golden Rose.

00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, I teach
people to read energy.

00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's what people
call being psychic.

00:54:57.220 --> 00:55:01.080 align:middle line:90%
All of our chakras read energy.

00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that--
this is what I think.

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Once I learn to read
energy, I can read anything.

00:55:07.090 --> 00:55:09.250 align:middle line:84%
It's like if I teach
somebody to read a book,

00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:11.425 align:middle line:84%
they can read any-- on
any subject they want.

00:55:11.425 --> 00:55:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, the same is true
with energy, you know?

00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:17.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's a lot of
things that the training does.

00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:18.670 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to
read other people.

00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:22.240 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to know where
you end and other people begin.

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.480 align:middle line:90%
And that's the first step--

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a big one.

00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:24.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: --in reading someone.

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:26.440 align:middle line:84%
You've got to know,
wait, is this me or them?

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, whose thought
is this going through my head?

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:29.100 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Exactly.

00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And then once you know
how the universe works,

00:55:32.170 --> 00:55:34.284 align:middle line:84%
then you can change
how the universe works.

00:55:34.284 --> 00:55:35.200 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:38.230 align:middle line:84%
I took out all the
engineering information

00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:40.360 align:middle line:84%
that I had been raised
with and put in,

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:41.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm a professional psychic.

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:45.020 align:middle line:84%
So one morning, that
hit critical mass,

00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:47.020 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't get in my
car and fight the commute

00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:49.180 align:middle line:90%
to get to a high-tech company.

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:51.730 align:middle line:84%
I walked from my bedroom
into my meditation room

00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:53.230 align:middle line:90%
and started doing readings.

00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:54.760 align:middle line:90%
So it really can happen.

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:56.496 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do
is shift the energy.

00:55:56.496 --> 00:55:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But
you're also a being

00:55:57.870 --> 00:56:02.560 align:middle line:84%
that has an innate understanding
of the proper use of will

00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:03.700 align:middle line:90%
within this.

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:03.970 align:middle line:90%
Many people--

00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: You're right.

00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:05.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --do not.

00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:07.330 align:middle line:90%
This is the missing ingredient.

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:08.600 align:middle line:10%
>>CIELO: And I won't give up.

00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:09.590 align:middle line:10%
I won't.

00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:12.130 align:middle line:10%
But I'm also very
patient with myself.

00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:15.340 align:middle line:10%
I always think I'm healing
with every beat of my heart,

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:16.960 align:middle line:10%
so it's just a slow drip.

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, well,
healing beautifully.

00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:21.982 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's
just so delightful.

00:56:21.982 --> 00:56:23.440 align:middle line:84%
I'd heard that you
were delightful,

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:25.662 align:middle line:84%
and it is absolute delight
to sit here with you.

00:56:25.662 --> 00:56:27.370 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
coming on the show.

00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>>CIELO: Thank you, Regina.

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:29.170 align:middle line:90%
