>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Dr. Anoop Kumar

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.840 align:middle line:10%
was reading a book during
his time as a medical student

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.820 align:middle line:10%
when he was suddenly gone.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.010 align:middle line:84%
He was experiencing
himself suddenly

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.820 align:middle line:84%
at the center of the sun and the
warm saffron glow, everything

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.600 align:middle line:90%
in the universe made of light.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.890 align:middle line:84%
He had to make a choice to stay
there or come back and live

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.910 align:middle line:84%
as light, as a doctor
in the ER, ultimately.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's so wonderful
to have you here.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.720 align:middle line:90%
We've had some conversations.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.340 align:middle line:84%
The reason I think you came
back to life from that moment

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:84%
was to start transforming
the medical field.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the institutions
that just cannot continue as it

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.330 align:middle line:90%
is, right?

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.870 align:middle line:90%
>>ANOOP KUMAR: Yes.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.662 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, even
you're the first one

00:00:55.662 --> 00:00:58.640 align:middle line:84%
to say what we call allopathic
medicine or mainstream medicine

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.770 align:middle line:84%
should be termed
complementary medicine.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Yes.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.160 align:middle line:10%
Allopathy and modern
medicine, what

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.070 align:middle line:10%
I do in the ER, which is bread
and butter allopathy, right?

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.870 align:middle line:90%
It's trauma.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:09.720 align:middle line:90%
It's heart attacks.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.580 align:middle line:90%
It's strokes.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.430 align:middle line:90%
That is complementary medicine.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.880 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea that,
let's say, Ayurveda

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.480 align:middle line:84%
or Chinese medicine or yoga
is complementary medicine

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.802 align:middle line:90%
is completely wrong.

00:01:23.802 --> 00:01:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Complementary means it's
an addition to something.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And so when do you take pills,
or when do you take IV meds,

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.140 align:middle line:90%
or when do you have surgery?

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.370 align:middle line:84%
That's when the other
stuff doesn't work.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.730 align:middle line:90%
That's not a primary medicine.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: That's
complementary, right?

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.700 align:middle line:10%
And the other way you
know it's complementary

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.480 align:middle line:10%
is that if you take it
away, most people will still

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.130 align:middle line:10%
be OK, right?

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.830 align:middle line:84%
But if you take away primary
medicine-- nutrition, movement,

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.050 align:middle line:84%
connection, and rest,
which are the fundamentals

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.970 align:middle line:84%
of every system
around the world,

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.740 align:middle line:84%
humans can't live
without nutrition,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.032 align:middle line:90%
movement, connection, and rest.

00:01:54.032 --> 00:01:56.260 align:middle line:84%
So that is by definition
primary medicine.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.477 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: And allopathy, what
I do, I'm proud of what I do,

00:01:59.477 --> 00:02:00.277 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:02:00.277 --> 00:02:02.130 align:middle line:84%
This is not putting
down allopathy.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.340 align:middle line:84%
This is contextualizing and
saying exactly what it is.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.350 align:middle line:84%
It is the true
complementary medicine.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And when we see it that way,
our society will thrive.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is many,
many, many lives

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.760 align:middle line:84%
are saved every day
as a result of it.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.380 align:middle line:90%
We can't put that down.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.520 align:middle line:90%
There's a place for the ER.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.350 align:middle line:84%
I've been there
many times myself,

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.260 align:middle line:84%
and had my own life saved
because of modern medicine

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.460 align:middle line:90%
and allopathy.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.320 align:middle line:84%
But there were
upstream events that

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.557 align:middle line:90%
trickled down to that moment.

00:02:27.557 --> 00:02:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Absolutely.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a beautiful and
important and powerful point

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.052 align:middle line:84%
for everyone, for
allopaths, for everyone

00:02:35.052 --> 00:02:37.510 align:middle line:84%
who practices medicine, every
professional and every person

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.420 align:middle line:84%
to know that this is not
putting down anybody.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.760 align:middle line:84%
This is actually
raising allopathy.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.540 align:middle line:84%
This is raising modern medicine
to what it is destined to be,

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.310 align:middle line:84%
to what it can do better
than anything else, you know?

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: We have
to understand that.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.493 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we don't
understand everything else.

00:02:53.493 --> 00:02:54.310 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.870 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: That is the problem.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.953 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the doctors
aren't trained that way,

00:02:56.953 --> 00:02:59.170 align:middle line:84%
and they just see a person
with a few symptoms.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.940 align:middle line:84%
You get a couple
minutes with them.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.130 align:middle line:84%
You make a diagnosis, and
there's your treatment.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.930 align:middle line:90%
Gone.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.777 align:middle line:84%
And the person's still in the
same condition, more or less,

00:03:06.777 --> 00:03:08.360 align:middle line:84%
that brought them
there to begin with.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to go
back to your experience

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.210 align:middle line:84%
when you were reading
that book that day

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.700 align:middle line:90%
and what happened to you.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Now first of all, you were
running on no sleep, right?

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.570 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Yeah.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.865 align:middle line:84%
I was actually in medical
school at the time,

00:03:21.865 --> 00:03:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and I had come back
for a vacation,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.230 align:middle line:90%
and I was at my parents' place.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.640 align:middle line:90%
And yes, I was reading a book.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.200 align:middle line:90%
I was always into philosophy.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Since I was a child, I was
into philosophy and kind

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:84%
of playing with my
mind and experimenting.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.030 align:middle line:90%
And there I was, reading a book.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.217 align:middle line:84%
And next thing I know, it was
like an explosion went off.

00:03:40.217 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way
I can describe it.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.670 align:middle line:90%
Like, boom.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.350 align:middle line:90%
Everything went to smithereens.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And there I was in the
center of the sun, which

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.510 align:middle line:90%
is such an odd thing to say.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.000 align:middle line:84%
I can't imagine that I would
ever have said that otherwise,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.010 align:middle line:90%
but nothing else seems right.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And I was there, sitting
there in the center

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:03.010 align:middle line:84%
of the sun in this brilliant
orange saffron blaze.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.620 align:middle line:90%
Timeless, beautiful.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not hot.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Not hot.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.805 align:middle line:90%
Not burning, not scalding.

00:04:09.805 --> 00:04:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Just like the essence of
pleasantness and satisfaction.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.196 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And almost--
and life-giving force.

00:04:16.196 --> 00:04:17.529 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Absolutely life-giving.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.510 align:middle line:90%
I mean, deathlessness.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: You know,
absolute deathlessness.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.520 align:middle line:90%
Everything you can imagine--

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.190 align:middle line:84%
ease, beauty, perfection-- all
of these things kind of fall

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.330 align:middle line:90%
short.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.710 align:middle line:84%
But in that moment, it
was as if every question

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.103 align:middle line:90%
had dropped away.

00:04:35.103 --> 00:04:36.770 align:middle line:84%
All the restlessness--
I had experienced

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.770 align:middle line:90%
restlessness in my life.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.850 align:middle line:84%
I was very unsatisfied with
school and what I was learning,

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.000 align:middle line:84%
and it just seemed
so insufficient.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.630 align:middle line:90%
Everything just dropped away.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And then it was as if I
was going beyond that.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I could
feel that if I kept going,

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:56.930 align:middle line:90%
it would have been over.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.310 align:middle line:90%
There was no coming back.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.540 align:middle line:90%
It was just moving forward.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.340 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.548 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there was
nothing physically wrong with

00:05:03.548 --> 00:05:04.380 align:middle line:90%
your body--

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.760 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Oh, no.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --at the time.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.590 align:middle line:90%
You were a healthy young man.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Yeah.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.145 align:middle line:84%
In fact, now when I think
back, I often think about,

00:05:10.145 --> 00:05:12.990 align:middle line:84%
what would the media have
said had I actually gone?

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.408 align:middle line:84%
They would have said, medical
student did drugs and died,

00:05:15.408 --> 00:05:17.450 align:middle line:84%
or who knows what they
would have said, you know?

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have to
find an excuse.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:19.490 align:middle line:90%
Physical, of course.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.700 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Right.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.500 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.910 align:middle line:84%
But I was-- no, I was
perfectly healthy.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.520 align:middle line:90%
But I knew that this was it.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.720 align:middle line:90%
One more step, and that was it.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.960 align:middle line:90%
And I was literally--

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.960 align:middle line:84%
that foot metaphorically
was forward

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.340 align:middle line:84%
when another kind of blaze
came up and instilled

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.140 align:middle line:84%
this thought in my mind
that, this is not fair.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.310 align:middle line:90%
This wouldn't be fair.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.790 align:middle line:90%
There's more work to do.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.330 align:middle line:90%
Kind of like, not yet.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.130 align:middle line:90%
Not yet.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it
was tempting, right?

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: Like,
all my force was--

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHS] Wanting
to go that direction.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.573 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: All my force was
going in that direction.

00:05:54.573 --> 00:05:56.180 align:middle line:84%
But what I didn't
feel in that moment,

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.222 align:middle line:84%
I think because of the
beauty of that experience,

00:05:58.222 --> 00:06:00.770 align:middle line:84%
was there was the
responsibility,

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.660 align:middle line:90%
the obligations, you know?

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And now what I know is what I
had come here for, all of that

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.150 align:middle line:84%
was there, and I'm
so grateful for that.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that in a
sense is even more beautiful

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.120 align:middle line:84%
than that experience,
I have to say,

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.630 align:middle line:84%
because when this being
communicated this, it was like,

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.400 align:middle line:84%
I had that foot
forward, and I stopped

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.680 align:middle line:84%
before I put the foot
on the ground, kind of.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And then all those agreements,
those things to do,

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.310 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, snapped me
back like a slingshot.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.510 align:middle line:90%
Back I came.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.067 align:middle line:84%
And there I was, sitting not
too dissimilar to this room,

00:06:35.067 --> 00:06:36.400 align:middle line:90%
in a room like this, in a chair.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.200 align:middle line:90%
The book was in front of me.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.490 align:middle line:90%
But everything had changed.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Everything had
changed at that point.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this is something
you had-- your soul arranged

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.230 align:middle line:84%
for you so you could
have this experience

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and know how
conscious the choices,

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.380 align:middle line:84%
but also know the nature of
reality on the other side,

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.890 align:middle line:84%
that all of us are on
some level tapped into,

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.400 align:middle line:90%
but we don't remember.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Right.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I realized
then is that it's not just

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.060 align:middle line:84%
the nature of reality
on the other side.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.940 align:middle line:90%
It's actually--

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This is our reality.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:06.580 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.080 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: It's
actually what this is.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.960 align:middle line:90%
That spilled over into this.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.145 align:middle line:84%
And then all the
restlessness had gone.

00:07:14.145 --> 00:07:15.270 align:middle line:90%
All the questions had gone.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.610 align:middle line:90%
I was like, OK.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.450 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.990 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.470 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know
what you're here for.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.473 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: It was like drinking
and drinking and drinking,

00:07:21.473 --> 00:07:23.330 align:middle line:90%
and saying, I see, I see, I see.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.135 align:middle line:84%
And just a tremendous
fullness, you know?

00:07:27.135 --> 00:07:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how did it
work for you at that point?

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.510 align:middle line:90%
So you're still in med school.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to
go back, and you've

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.960 align:middle line:84%
got this grinding schedule
in your residency.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Right.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.860 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, so initially, you know,
I didn't really realize it

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.650 align:middle line:90%
as I came back into that room--

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:47.150 align:middle line:84%
you know, I was looking around
and I think just taking it in,

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:47.950 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.867 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You went to
the bathroom after that.

00:07:49.867 --> 00:07:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I remember that
part of the story.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.133 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: I did because I
mean, I felt like a newborn.

00:07:54.133 --> 00:07:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I felt like a toddler
who had learned to walk.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.660 align:middle line:84%
You know how they cruise, they
hold on to things and walk?

00:07:58.660 --> 00:07:59.500 align:middle line:90%
I felt like that's--

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.730 align:middle line:90%
I was kind of like--

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.500 align:middle line:84%
because space appeared
different to me.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.970 align:middle line:90%
Space appeared as a thing to me.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:05.770 align:middle line:90%
I could feel space.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:06.760 align:middle line:90%
I knew what space was.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.635 align:middle line:90%
It was very intimate.

00:08:07.635 --> 00:08:10.360 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like-- it wasn't just
something to put things into,

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.020 align:middle line:84%
It was-- so I was
kind of doing this.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.715 align:middle line:84%
And then I walked
into the bathroom

00:08:15.715 --> 00:08:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and looked in the mirror,
and I was like, who

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.770 align:middle line:90%
is this guy that seems so--

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.710 align:middle line:84%
that person was way too
peaceful to be me, you know?

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.470 align:middle line:90%
That person was way too content.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:26.470 align:middle line:90%
There were no questions.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.060 align:middle line:90%
There was no restlessness.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And then I remember moving
my face in different ways.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.789 align:middle line:84%
And then it was just
this kind of getting

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:37.990 align:middle line:84%
to know what I am, my body
and the thought process.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Like, seeing how thoughts came
in, seeing how feelings arose.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And then I didn't
say anything, I

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.170 align:middle line:84%
have to say, because
I had also been raised

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:51.190 align:middle line:84%
in this tradition of Advaita,
this philosophy that had always

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.130 align:middle line:84%
said, don't pay too much
attention to these things.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:55.540 align:middle line:90%
These things happen.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.980 align:middle line:90%
They're a part of the process.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:57.780 align:middle line:90%
Integrate.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:58.840 align:middle line:90%
Move forward, you know?

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't talk about this
for probably over 10 years,

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.670 align:middle line:84%
15 years because I
was always taught,

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.050 align:middle line:90%
don't get caught up in this.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
great advice for me.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Now I talk about it
because I think it's--

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.760 align:middle line:84%
I want to show people
what's possible.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.268 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: But I went
through a long period

00:09:13.268 --> 00:09:14.140 align:middle line:90%
of just integrating.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And like you said,
I went to residency.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:17.960 align:middle line:84%
I got married
shortly after that.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Then I started my residency
in emergency medicine

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.490 align:middle line:90%
in Philadelphia.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Gunshot wounds and stab wounds
and heart attacks and strokes,

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.920 align:middle line:84%
everything, up at all
hours of the night.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.020 align:middle line:84%
That's when it got
difficult. Until then--

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.603 align:middle line:84%
because I was at the
end of med school

00:09:30.603 --> 00:09:32.350 align:middle line:84%
before, kind of
coasted a little bit.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Things were kind of
integrating in their own way.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.320 align:middle line:84%
But when I got to the
hospital, and it was like,

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.630 align:middle line:84%
you have to do this,
this, this, this, this,

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.340 align:middle line:84%
and it became very specific,
that became very challenging.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're seeing
the most dire situations

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.867 align:middle line:84%
that humanity experiences
in the middle of the night.

00:09:48.867 --> 00:09:50.450 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: And I'm
feeling it intensely.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.705 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling what these
people are feeling intensely.

00:09:52.705 --> 00:09:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did it
get to the point

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.080 align:middle line:84%
where when these people came
in, whether it was a heart

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.750 align:middle line:84%
attack or a gunshot wound,
as you said, that you

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.480 align:middle line:84%
could see what had
precipitated it,

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.070 align:middle line:90%
you could see their journey?

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: In the sense that
I could see that this was

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.170 align:middle line:90%
a downstream event, you know?

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:10.310 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you this story.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:15.020 align:middle line:84%
There was one night in the ER
that was particularly nuts.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.288 align:middle line:84%
Usually Mondays and
Tuesdays evenings and nights

00:10:17.288 --> 00:10:19.205 align:middle line:84%
tend to be bad, and
especially in the summer--

00:10:19.205 --> 00:10:19.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Monday and Tuesday?

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:21.350 align:middle line:90%
You'd think Friday, Saturday.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.170 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: No, it's-- people stay
home on the weekend and they

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.030 align:middle line:84%
tend to get sicker, and then
on the Monday and Tuesday

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.830 align:middle line:90%
they'll come in.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:27.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: And especially in
the summer on a warm day,

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.300 align:middle line:84%
you can see a lot of trauma
when people-- when it's hot,

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.835 align:middle line:90%
people tend to get more active.

00:10:33.835 --> 00:10:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of
those evenings,

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:36.500 align:middle line:90%
one of those late nights.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was all kinds of gunshot
wounds and trauma and stab

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.420 align:middle line:84%
wounds, and all these
kinds of things.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And then I remember,
just when you

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:48.890 align:middle line:84%
thought it couldn't get worse,
a nurse ran in with a baby

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:50.540 align:middle line:90%
into the resuscitation bay.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.158 align:middle line:84%
And everybody went
around this baby.

00:10:53.158 --> 00:10:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
started doing everything.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a tornado,
everything whirling, all

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.670 align:middle line:84%
the diagnoses, everybody
doing everything,

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.170 align:middle line:90%
the different people coming in.

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And then something happened
where it was like--

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:10.130 align:middle line:84%
it was like someone pressed
Pause on everything,

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and it was as though
everything stood still.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was as though
I went and sat down

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:18.370 align:middle line:84%
in the corner of the
room with my legs folded

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.380 align:middle line:90%
into a meditative state.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.770 align:middle line:90%
That's what it felt like.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And kind of saw
everything that happened.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And what came to me is we
have no idea what health is.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, that stood out
to me in that moment.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.560 align:middle line:84%
After seeing all of
these things come in that

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.400 align:middle line:84%
were downstream events, far,
far, far downstream events.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.458 align:middle line:84%
But we have to look at what's
upstream, which is how we

00:11:41.458 --> 00:11:42.750 align:middle line:90%
are seeing ourselves, you know?

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.010 align:middle line:90%
That's the true emergency.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.000 align:middle line:84%
That's the origin
of the emergency.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, it's going
to take a complete revamping.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And I know health revolution,
that is why you came back.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.810 align:middle line:84%
You came back to help create
a revolution in health

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:03.450 align:middle line:84%
so that we do start with the
preceding factors on a soul

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.670 align:middle line:84%
level, all the
way trickling down

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.040 align:middle line:84%
to how we end up
with a stab wound

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.180 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the night.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:09.780 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Yes.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:10.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's really
a question of anatomy

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.200 align:middle line:84%
because when we
talk about anatomy,

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.770 align:middle line:84%
my anatomy atlas was called
"Atlas of Human Anatomy"

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.060 align:middle line:90%
in medical school, right?

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's not actually an
atlas of human anatomy.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:25.483 align:middle line:84%
It's an atlas of
human body anatomy.

00:12:25.483 --> 00:12:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Body anatomy, yes.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.192 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: And there's
a big difference

00:12:28.192 --> 00:12:31.030 align:middle line:84%
between complete human anatomy
and human body anatomy.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Again, like we said
about modern medicine

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.040 align:middle line:84%
being complementary
medicine, human body anatomy

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.380 align:middle line:84%
is extremely
important, but it has

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:42.520 align:middle line:84%
to be contextualized in complete
human anatomy, which includes

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.600 align:middle line:84%
mind, energy, soul,
spirit, information, all

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.080 align:middle line:84%
of these things that live
at the boundaries of science

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.590 align:middle line:84%
and philosophy and medicine
and our direct experience.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How are we going--

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.260 align:middle line:90%
OK, we'll get to that later.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.750 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to even
begin making this leap?

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.180 align:middle line:90%
Because you were already--

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.100 align:middle line:84%
you'd had your
spiritual experiences.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.770 align:middle line:84%
You were interested in
philosophy and the nature

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.850 align:middle line:90%
of being, mind, et cetera.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.210 align:middle line:84%
So you were already primed
to take this revolution

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:13.160 align:middle line:84%
on as an allopathic
complementary doctor.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:13.960 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Yes.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The others
aren't for the most part.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:17.770 align:middle line:90%
Very few are.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:18.935 align:middle line:90%
And I want to talk about--

00:13:18.935 --> 00:13:21.310 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to ask a little bit,
are you seeing a difference

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:24.070 align:middle line:84%
in the motivations of young
people coming into medicine

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.260 align:middle line:90%
today versus a while back?

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.730 align:middle line:84%
But we'll get to
that in a minute

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:28.990 align:middle line:90%
because one of the things--

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.690 align:middle line:84%
you were also experiencing
kind of multiple timelines

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:34.750 align:middle line:84%
at one point, and you see
these different-- talk to us

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:38.180 align:middle line:84%
about how these timelines
exist alongside another

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and one expresses and
plays out versus another.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: When we come
into this lifetime,

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.390 align:middle line:84%
we come in with almost
like a few seeds

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:50.500 align:middle line:84%
sprouting out of a whole
bag of seeds, you know?

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And so a few seeds--
so in this lifetime,

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.670 align:middle line:84%
we express in this
particular way.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.190 align:middle line:84%
In other lifetimes, we
expressed in other ways.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And the way I see
it, these lifetimes

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.990 align:middle line:90%
are not necessarily sequential.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.683 align:middle line:84%
It's not that one has
to finish and then

00:14:03.683 --> 00:14:05.350 align:middle line:84%
another one starts,
and then another one

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:09.430 align:middle line:84%
starts because again, as we move
towards complete human anatomy,

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:12.070 align:middle line:84%
we're not just a body, and
we're not just a local thinking

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:13.810 align:middle line:90%
mind and local emotions.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.490 align:middle line:84%
If we were, then it
would have to be,

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:16.750 align:middle line:90%
OK, I have to experience this.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:17.830 align:middle line:90%
Then I can experience that.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:18.955 align:middle line:90%
Then I can experience that.

00:14:18.955 --> 00:14:22.690 align:middle line:84%
But actually, this is a
projection of our deeper

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.060 align:middle line:90%
nature, of our deeper self.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And our deeper self is
not in this timeline.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.180 align:middle line:90%
It's not in this linear time.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And so it can be having other
experiences in other timelines

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.340 align:middle line:84%
as this part of our self
is having this experience

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.510 align:middle line:90%
in this timeline.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you felt at one
point that you had projected

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.510 align:middle line:84%
or you were on a
path, a timeline that

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.400 align:middle line:84%
was really far into the future
of humanity at one point.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Yes.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So this gets into the
nature of dimensions.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.950 align:middle line:84%
In one sense, we can talk--
we can say, we're in a place

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:53.250 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:54.375 align:middle line:90%
We're in Boulder, Colorado.

00:14:54.375 --> 00:14:56.340 align:middle line:84%
We're in a physical
studio, for example.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.550 align:middle line:84%
But when you look
beyond the physical,

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:02.100 align:middle line:84%
this is actually a
perceptual experience

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.770 align:middle line:84%
that we are cognitively
stitching together and saying,

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:06.932 align:middle line:84%
this is a hard physical
experience, right?

00:15:06.932 --> 00:15:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: An agreed
upon kind of reality.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Right.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.860 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like a consensus
reality that we have.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.950 align:middle line:84%
So when we zoom out a little
bit and step back a little bit,

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:18.360 align:middle line:84%
this is actually in a simpler
sense a dimensional experience.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.330 align:middle line:84%
This is a dimension that we are
co-creating and experiencing

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:23.130 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And what we call other
planets or other places

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.960 align:middle line:84%
are also other dimensions
because they're happening

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.340 align:middle line:90%
at different time scales.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Everything in this
dimension is vibrating

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.940 align:middle line:90%
at a particular frequency.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And so if you change
the frequency,

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.910 align:middle line:90%
it's a different dimension.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:40.210 align:middle line:84%
So what we think
about as civilizations

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:44.290 align:middle line:84%
on other planets, of which
there are numerous, innumerable,

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.730 align:middle line:84%
many of them are vibrating
at different frequencies

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.710 align:middle line:84%
so they don't experience
time the same way.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Just like a moth might
live a day or two,

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.160 align:middle line:84%
and that's a complete
lifetime for them, you know?

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Galapagos turtle might be
100 years or 200 years.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.210 align:middle line:90%
That's their timeline.

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:00.380 align:middle line:90%
And yet, they're all lifetimes.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And so when we change
our frequency--

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.320 align:middle line:84%
which, we are all
frequency machines and we

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.450 align:middle line:84%
all have that ability--
then we access

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.880 align:middle line:84%
what are called other
dimensions or other places.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And yes, one of those
was, I would say,

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.940 align:middle line:84%
something like a crystal city
in which the architecture

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.410 align:middle line:90%
is totally different.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:18.975 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
our world, the way

00:16:18.975 --> 00:16:20.350 align:middle line:84%
I think about our
world, if I had

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:22.910 align:middle line:84%
to say one thing about our
world, it's 90 degrees.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:23.840 align:middle line:90%
Look everywhere.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.740 align:middle line:90%
It's 90 degrees.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 90 degrees.

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: You know?

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:27.262 align:middle line:90%
Like, it's squares.

00:16:27.262 --> 00:16:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is true.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: And that represents
a way of thinking.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:35.350 align:middle line:84%
It represents if/and or
if/then, this or that thinking.

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Because you have a
straight line, and then

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.220 align:middle line:84%
you come to this way or that
way like the top of a pillar

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.240 align:middle line:90%
or the corner of a room.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.250 align:middle line:84%
You go down, and it's
this way or that way.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:46.670 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a
mentality that sees--

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:48.540 align:middle line:90%
it's either this or it's that.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.920 align:middle line:84%
But when you get into
spherical architecture, when

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.630 align:middle line:84%
you get to pyramidal
architecture

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:57.570 align:middle line:84%
where you have convergence
points, then what you have is,

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.530 align:middle line:84%
for example, a type of thinking
that says that all of this

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.687 align:middle line:90%
goes to the same place, right?

00:17:02.687 --> 00:17:05.270 align:middle line:84%
That understanding is there and
implicit in that architecture,

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.640 align:middle line:84%
or in curved,
spherical architecture

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.789 align:middle line:84%
where the rooms are more
curved rather than cornered.

00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:13.790 align:middle line:84%
It's that all of this
circulates within ourselves.

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.140 align:middle line:90%
This all comes back to us.

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.990 align:middle line:84%
That's the underlying thinking,
rather than it's either this

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.867 align:middle line:90%
or it's that.

00:17:18.867 --> 00:17:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, no,
that's interesting

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:25.319 align:middle line:84%
because when I've gone off
on trips into the deep past,

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:28.069 align:middle line:84%
I was in very spherical
environments that

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:30.810 align:middle line:84%
had no electricity
as we know it,

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:33.290 align:middle line:84%
but we were able-- they
glowed almost from the inside.

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And to crystal places,
crystal cities.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Many years ago I used
to go regularly to one,

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.450 align:middle line:84%
and it was a very different
kind of experience and thinking

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:42.570 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.075 align:middle line:90%
And so these can be anywhere.

00:17:45.075 --> 00:17:45.950 align:middle line:90%
They can be our past.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.480 align:middle line:90%
They can be our future.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.910 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, it all
collapses into now

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:51.620 align:middle line:84%
for the purposes of
what we're doing.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.210 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to
add this one thing

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.850 align:middle line:84%
because I love it so
much about Rudolf Steiner

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and the Waldorf system, is
that until the kids, I think,

00:17:58.850 --> 00:17:59.780 align:middle line:90%
are in 4th or--

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.840 align:middle line:84%
4th grade, all the
corners are cut off.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Every paper they
interface with has

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:09.357 align:middle line:84%
to have rounded corners to
keep the creativity alive

00:18:09.357 --> 00:18:10.190 align:middle line:90%
while they're young.

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Yes, absolutely.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:14.945 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, this to me
is so brilliant and critical.

00:18:14.945 --> 00:18:17.930 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: If we designed rooms
not radically differently,

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.300 align:middle line:84%
but just so the
corners are rounded--

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In hospitals--

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: --it would change.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.642 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It would
change everything.

00:18:23.642 --> 00:18:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: And the other
thing about time,

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.870 align:middle line:90%
you said it can be our past.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:30.220 align:middle line:90%
It can be our future.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.240 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:35.185 align:middle line:84%
Because all these experiences
come in as we attend to them.

00:18:35.185 --> 00:18:38.420 align:middle line:84%
So we consider this the
present, which it is.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as we go
deeply into an experience,

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.520 align:middle line:84%
that becomes our present
and this becomes the past.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:48.295 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: So rather than sticking
with some artificial timeline,

00:18:48.295 --> 00:18:49.550 align:middle line:90%
we came up with a number.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:52.780 align:middle line:84%
The Year 0 was 2,023
years ago, right?

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.385 align:middle line:90%
But it's rather arbitrary.

00:18:54.385 --> 00:18:56.260 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
seasons, they're cyclical.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.330 align:middle line:84%
If you look at January,
February, March, it's cyclical.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:59.740 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
weeks, it's cyclical.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.750 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the year, the
Earth going around the sun,

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:02.723 align:middle line:90%
it's cyclical.

00:19:02.723 --> 00:19:04.390 align:middle line:84%
So why do we have
years that are linear?

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:05.470 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense.

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:07.960 align:middle line:84%
What we should be
doing is labeling that

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.687 align:middle line:84%
based on how the
sun is revolving

00:19:09.687 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:90%
around the center of the galaxy.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Yeah.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.275 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:19:13.275 --> 00:19:14.530 align:middle line:90%
And I had a guest yesterday.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Christopher Bache who
wrote the book "LSD

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.300 align:middle line:84%
and the Mind of the Universe,"
and had these incredible

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.562 align:middle line:84%
experiences similar to what
you're sharing with me.

00:19:21.562 --> 00:19:24.020 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of hoping you two
would be here at the same time

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:24.490 align:middle line:90%
and could meet.

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:25.590 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work out.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:27.080 align:middle line:84%
But one thing he
was explaining is

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.030 align:middle line:84%
that when it was
all said and done,

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:32.810 align:middle line:84%
regardless of which dimension,
timeline you were in,

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:38.300 align:middle line:84%
nirvana equated to having
absolute full presence in where

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.330 align:middle line:84%
you are now, in the moment
and where you are now.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.230 align:middle line:90%
How do you relate to that?

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:47.220 align:middle line:10%
>>KUMAR: So what we can say
is the nature of things,

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.060 align:middle line:10%
let's say, is light, OK?

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.505 align:middle line:84%
And that is just not the
nature of physical things.

00:19:52.505 --> 00:19:53.630 align:middle line:90%
It's the nature of thought.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:54.755 align:middle line:90%
It's the nature of emotion.

00:19:54.755 --> 00:19:56.135 align:middle line:90%
It's the nature of space.

00:19:56.135 --> 00:20:00.580 align:middle line:90%
Light is what diffuses as space.

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And if that's true,
then no matter

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.745 align:middle line:84%
how far out we can think
or imagine or experience,

00:20:06.745 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:84%
some planet in
some other galaxy,

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.850 align:middle line:84%
way in the past, way in
the future, or right here,

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:14.840 align:middle line:84%
or what we said a
few moments ago,

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:19.930 align:middle line:84%
it's actually all constructed
from and structured in light.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And so nirvana then
is this experience

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:25.930 align:middle line:84%
of our nature as
light because that's

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:28.060 align:middle line:90%
what defines the word here.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.320 align:middle line:84%
When we say here, I am
here, what does that mean?

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.460 align:middle line:84%
That means my
identity is immovable.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:34.690 align:middle line:90%
It is here.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Everything else moves
and rotates and revolves

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:40.630 align:middle line:84%
like the sun around
the center of the Milky

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:42.340 align:middle line:90%
Way or all the galaxies.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.595 align:middle line:84%
All of that revolves
in my light.

00:20:44.595 --> 00:20:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: At this
point of light.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: Yes, where that my is
this infinite nature, right?

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:54.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's nirvana because
until that becomes clear,

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.290 align:middle line:84%
there's always
going to be wanting

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:58.410 align:middle line:84%
to explore other dimensions,
because it's cool.

00:20:58.410 --> 00:20:59.210 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:00.010 align:middle line:90%
It's fantastic.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:00.890 align:middle line:90%
And we should.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:01.690 align:middle line:90%
We can, right?

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.152 align:middle line:90%
That's our potential.

00:21:03.152 --> 00:21:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
there's a lot to be--

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: But that shouldn't
be from a place of lack.

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:08.240 align:middle line:84%
It should be from
a place of fullness

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.580 align:middle line:84%
and, how amazing
is this, you know?

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I agree.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:12.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:14.690 align:middle line:90%
So now, we had talked before.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.940 align:middle line:84%
There are so many ways we
can go in this conversation.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.000 align:middle line:84%
But one of them was about
these experiences people have

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.420 align:middle line:84%
and the notion of mental health
in the world of allopathy.

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.250 align:middle line:84%
What happens to people who
see things differently?

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:27.680 align:middle line:90%
You end up in a psych ward.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.240 align:middle line:90%
You end up on medications.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And a very large percentage
of our population

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.740 align:middle line:84%
is drugged right now,
including the kids.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:34.540 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Yes.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: People watching are
on various mood-altering drugs.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Yes.

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Their kids may be
on Ritalin, and so forth.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Yes.

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about that

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.620 align:middle line:84%
for a moment, the
notion of mind not

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.830 align:middle line:84%
fitting into a specific
model, behavior

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:51.680 align:middle line:84%
not fitting into a
specific model when

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.140 align:middle line:90%
so much is changing so rapidly.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.760 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: I mean, it's such
a huge and important topic.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.970 align:middle line:84%
I think it's one of the
most important topics

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:00.920 align:middle line:90%
today in the world.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.420 align:middle line:84%
I'll just start
with my experience.

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.610 align:middle line:84%
When my experience
started opening up,

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:09.530 align:middle line:84%
I was so fortunate to
have three anchor points.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:12.980 align:middle line:84%
One was I had studied this
philosophy for decades prior

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:16.380 align:middle line:84%
to that, for a couple decades,
or more than one decade easily.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.880 align:middle line:84%
I had been around people who
made this their life, who

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.860 align:middle line:84%
had been through this
and more, and who

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.950 align:middle line:90%
had been integrating this.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:25.750 align:middle line:84%
I also had the
perspective of a doctor.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:27.430 align:middle line:84%
I knew how-- I'd done
my psych rotation.

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:28.570 align:middle line:90%
I knew how doctors think.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.460 align:middle line:90%
I know the model, right?

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:33.152 align:middle line:84%
And I also had someone who
had been through it near me

00:22:33.152 --> 00:22:34.360 align:middle line:90%
who I could ask questions to.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:38.710 align:middle line:84%
So when this happened to
me, as difficult as it

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.860 align:middle line:84%
was-- and it was really hard the
first six months of residency

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.540 align:middle line:84%
when all the stuff
was happening.

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I was
outside the body.

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:46.300 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I was in the body.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I was
with the patient.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:50.350 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I was somewhere else.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And night and day started
to go up and down.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Things were so wild and
needed so much integration

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:02.267 align:middle line:84%
that I could have easily been
diagnosed with any range of--

00:23:02.267 --> 00:23:03.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Schizophrenia [LAUGHS]

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.933 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: Schizophrenia, bipolar
with psychotic features,

00:23:05.933 --> 00:23:06.840 align:middle line:90%
depression.

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you name it.

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:10.380 align:middle line:90%
It could be anything.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.900 align:middle line:84%
But I never thought
about it that way.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.450 align:middle line:84%
The way I thought
about it is, this

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:19.500 align:middle line:84%
is a really important sentinel
experience in this lifetime,

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.460 align:middle line:90%
and let me integrate this.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.330 align:middle line:84%
There was never any
negative-- there was never

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:25.380 align:middle line:90%
any thought of disease.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.963 align:middle line:84%
There were never any thought of
illness or anything like that.

00:23:27.963 --> 00:23:30.780 align:middle line:84%
It was just a difficult process
that I had to integrate.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: And that
is so critical.

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:36.150 align:middle line:90%
And I knew what to say to whom.

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:38.215 align:middle line:84%
I knew-- to this
person, don't say this.

00:23:38.215 --> 00:23:39.840 align:middle line:84%
It will terrify them
too much, and they

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.000 align:middle line:84%
have to start-- they have to
start thinking about illness,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:42.800 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.400 align:middle line:84%
This person will just think it's
crazy, so don't even bother.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.893 align:middle line:84%
So I started to develop a
language and a strategy--

00:23:47.893 --> 00:23:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
you had discernment.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: And I had discernment.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:51.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.950 align:middle line:90%
And I knew--

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:54.823 align:middle line:84%
I had my own story
for what was happening

00:23:54.823 --> 00:23:57.240 align:middle line:84%
that was really helpful, and
that's where that three minds

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.560 align:middle line:90%
framework came from.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.010 align:middle line:84%
But then I also saw with
a lot of my patients

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:05.190 align:middle line:84%
that they were going
through something like this.

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:08.250 align:middle line:84%
When you don't know the
nature of the mind, in my view

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.170 align:middle line:84%
you can't really talk
about mental illness.

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:11.370 align:middle line:90%
It's mental illness.

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:12.750 align:middle line:90%
Mind, illness.

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:15.885 align:middle line:84%
But in allopathy, we
don't know what mind is.

00:24:15.885 --> 00:24:18.060 align:middle line:90%
Mind is not a physical thing.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Our model of
anatomy is physical.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.950 align:middle line:90%
So what are we really--

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:84%
where's the knowledge
base for that?

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.100 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm
talking about now.

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.500 align:middle line:84%
There is a place for
medication, absolutely.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I've seen this
happen in my own family.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.770 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it with others.

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:35.010 align:middle line:84%
There is a place for
medication, but it

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:37.860 align:middle line:84%
has to be medication as
a temporizing measure

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.290 align:middle line:84%
while our own
knowledge base helps

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:43.650 align:middle line:84%
us bring this person
along and integrate this.

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Medication from a place of
ignorance where I don't even

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:51.000 align:middle line:84%
know what mind is is
basically suppressing a person

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.340 align:middle line:84%
and not allowing them
to integrate fully

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:54.490 align:middle line:90%
into their life.

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:57.542 align:middle line:84%
So there has to be a role for
medication with knowledge.

00:24:57.542 --> 00:24:58.342 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:24:58.342 --> 00:25:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And so some of the
things that land people

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.640 align:middle line:84%
in a situation where they're
given medication or put

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.907 align:middle line:84%
into a psychiatric ward are--
we have three little things

00:25:05.907 --> 00:25:07.240 align:middle line:90%
that we talked about off camera.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is people
who are actually seeing

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.350 align:middle line:84%
into other dimensions and very
confused at what's going on.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Yes.

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:13.950 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:16.420 align:middle line:84%
So this gets into hallucinations
versus what's not.

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I don't
know that there

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:25.462 align:middle line:84%
is a place or a need for
the word hallucination.

00:25:25.462 --> 00:25:27.170 align:middle line:84%
We have gotten to a
place in neuroscience

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:28.712 align:middle line:84%
where we understand
that the world is

00:25:28.712 --> 00:25:30.800 align:middle line:84%
a kind of collective
hallucination, where

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.960 align:middle line:84%
we are kind of co-constructing
what we see, you know?

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:39.770 align:middle line:84%
The brain basically has ion
signals, sodium and potassium

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:42.770 align:middle line:84%
channels, that are flowing
to the occipital cortex that

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:45.020 align:middle line:84%
takes in light and then
constructs the image.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not seeing what's here.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:49.230 align:middle line:84%
It's seeing interpretations
of reflections of light.

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:51.320 align:middle line:84%
So what is actually
here is up for grabs.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.970 align:middle line:90%
Nobody really knows, right?

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:56.960 align:middle line:84%
So for me to say that this
person is hallucinating I think

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.282 align:middle line:84%
takes a tremendous
amount of arrogance.

00:25:59.282 --> 00:26:00.740 align:middle line:84%
What I can say is
you're perceiving

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:01.948 align:middle line:90%
something I'm not perceiving.

00:26:01.948 --> 00:26:03.110 align:middle line:90%
That's fair.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:05.690 align:middle line:84%
The question is, what is the
meaning of that in your life?

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:06.990 align:middle line:90%
You're perceiving something--

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But these
aren't the questions

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.740 align:middle line:84%
that are asked when
they end up in the ER

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.930 align:middle line:84%
when a concerned
relative brings them in.

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: No, because we have a
paradigm based in the physical.

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is the
brain creates the mind.

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:19.070 align:middle line:84%
What everybody sees is
what you should see.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be like
me, so let me medicate

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.280 align:middle line:90%
you to be like me, you know?

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.783 align:middle line:90%
And that's the problem.

00:26:24.783 --> 00:26:26.700 align:middle line:84%
But we have to start
looking into these things

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.080 align:middle line:84%
where we get to the
point where we say,

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.038 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing different
things, but the question

00:26:30.038 --> 00:26:31.470 align:middle line:90%
is, is it working for you?

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:33.157 align:middle line:84%
What's the relevance
in your life?

00:26:33.157 --> 00:26:33.990 align:middle line:90%
If this perception--

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's tearing
your life apart--

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.490 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: --then let's
look at its meaning

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.050 align:middle line:84%
and find out how
to integrate that.

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:40.050 align:middle line:90%
Well, we're not there yet.

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:42.240 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of where
you're hoping we end up

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.560 align:middle line:90%
over the decades ahead.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Another area is when people
are seeing actual entities

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:48.660 align:middle line:84%
or beings or having
them talk to them

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.650 align:middle line:84%
from either other
dimensions or other places.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:51.450 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Yes.

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So this has happened to me
where if my frequency goes

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.350 align:middle line:84%
to a certain place, I
start accessing other,

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.420 align:middle line:84%
let's say, beings,
other entities.

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And they can talk, and
there's a strategy.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.810 align:middle line:90%
There's a way to deal with it.

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you don't
attend to it that much,

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:07.680 align:middle line:90%
then it's not a factor.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:11.540 align:middle line:84%
If you want to engage, then you
can consciously engage, right?

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:15.130 align:middle line:84%
These beings that are all
around us are, in a sense,

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:15.930 align:middle line:90%
just like people.

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:17.970 align:middle line:84%
They're quote, unquote
"good people," "bad people,"

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:18.927 align:middle line:90%
everything in between.

00:27:18.927 --> 00:27:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has their
biases, their interests,

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:21.900 align:middle line:90%
what they want to do.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's not just
true of us Homo sapiens.

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:25.410 align:middle line:84%
That's true of all
kinds of species.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:26.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From all dimensions.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:26.930 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: --across the spectrum.

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:27.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:29.880 align:middle line:84%
So just like we
learn how to deal

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.500 align:middle line:84%
with each other in
our social culture,

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.150 align:middle line:84%
we learn how to deal
with other beings.

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And we know how to open a
channel or close it off or say,

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.320 align:middle line:84%
no, I don't want that, or yes,
I would like this interaction.

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's all just
so normal, you know?

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It is normal,
until something happens

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:47.730 align:middle line:84%
that makes it very
abnormal where somebody

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:51.210 align:middle line:84%
is being interfered-- something
is going on in their own field.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:53.220 align:middle line:90%
They're very permeable and open.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:54.270 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Yes.

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Whatever
the setup emotionally,

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:58.600 align:middle line:84%
they're now being
told by some entity,

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.390 align:middle line:84%
you need to take out these kids
at that school, or whatever.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:02.190 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Yes.

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:06.300 align:middle line:84%
But a major reason why things
become dysfunctional like that

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.710 align:middle line:84%
is because of the
ignorance in our society.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So when you think this kind of
communication cannot happen,

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:15.780 align:middle line:84%
it's abnormal, it's
hallucination, it's illness,

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:18.455 align:middle line:84%
then what happens is you have
to veer off onto your own path.

00:28:18.455 --> 00:28:19.580 align:middle line:90%
You don't really have help.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.100 align:middle line:90%
You can't talk to anybody.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:21.360 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know you're
hearing something and being

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:25.110 align:middle line:84%
given instructions, and
no one believes you.

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Exactly.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like a kid who meets
a stranger that might

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.770 align:middle line:90%
want to take advantage of them.

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:29.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: What do strangers do?

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:31.545 align:middle line:90%
They kind of isolate you.

00:28:31.545 --> 00:28:32.958 align:middle line:90%
You can't talk to anybody.

00:28:32.958 --> 00:28:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And then you can kind
of fall prey to that.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's the same thing here.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.460 align:middle line:84%
If everybody's saying, that
doesn't happen, that's crazy,

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.335 align:middle line:84%
don't talk about that,
then you're all alone.

00:28:40.335 --> 00:28:42.085 align:middle line:84%
But if everybody says,
you know what? this

00:28:42.085 --> 00:28:44.460 align:middle line:84%
happens all the time, everybody
experiences this, now all

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.960 align:middle line:84%
of the sudden you
can talk to people

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.360 align:middle line:84%
and you're not so vulnerable
to these influences.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And again, I think having
the discernment-- well,

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:55.275 align:middle line:84%
in general a sense of
well-being enough to know,

00:28:55.275 --> 00:28:57.720 align:middle line:84%
you know, that's not a
productive message that I'm

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.300 align:middle line:90%
hearing from whomever this is.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:00.100 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Exactly.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think I'm going
to close the door on that one.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:02.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Right.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:03.810 align:middle line:90%
I have that ability.

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where does it
take you in your life?

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:08.448 align:middle line:84%
To a higher place
or to a lower place?

00:29:08.448 --> 00:29:09.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's really
simple when it comes

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.830 align:middle line:90%
to engaging with entities.

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:14.670 align:middle line:84%
But I think
recently, there was--

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:84%
in 2023, there was a
mass shooting event

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.700 align:middle line:84%
that was so sad because the
man knew he was troubled.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.380 align:middle line:90%
He was saying, I'm troubled.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.060 align:middle line:84%
He was saying, I
think I need help.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.980 align:middle line:90%
He was laying it all out.

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.240 align:middle line:90%
No one did a darn thing.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.540 align:middle line:84%
There were even laws in
place for that situation.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:31.950 align:middle line:90%
Everybody ignored it.

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And of course, a lot of
people died as a result.

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a failure
of every sys--

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.330 align:middle line:84%
we know we're having
failures of systems.

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:40.590 align:middle line:90%
Your comment on that?

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: My comment on that
is that the reason we are

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.990 align:middle line:84%
so terrible at dealing with
emotions-- that's basically

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.790 align:middle line:90%
an emotional thing.

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.305 align:middle line:84%
This person was having
emotional disturbances--

00:29:50.305 --> 00:29:51.513 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Extreme emotional--

00:29:51.513 --> 00:29:53.090 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: --trauma.

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:55.050 align:middle line:84%
We don't like to deal
with that in our society.

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:55.640 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.140 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's a downstream effect.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Once you say that we are
atomic creatures, that we

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.137 align:middle line:84%
are physical things,
that the brain comes

00:30:03.137 --> 00:30:04.970 align:middle line:84%
first and everything
else, then what happens

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:08.760 align:middle line:84%
is emotions and all that stuff
is stuff to be controlled.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:09.997 align:middle line:90%
It's not stuff to experience.

00:30:09.997 --> 00:30:11.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not stuff that enlivens us.

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:13.350 align:middle line:84%
It's to be controlled
and put in a corner.

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And so even for so
many professionals

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:17.090 align:middle line:90%
that's the case, right?

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Not coming to terms
with our emotions,

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.230 align:middle line:84%
not reaching that vast
place in ourselves

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:24.470 align:middle line:84%
contextualizes the physical
and gives us that ability

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.060 align:middle line:84%
to deal with all
of these things,

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:28.400 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to break down
the boundaries in ourselves

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.480 align:middle line:84%
because we see ourselves
as so much more,

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.480 align:middle line:84%
and then we can handle
all the trauma, you know?

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:33.980 align:middle line:84%
It's not so difficult.
Otherwise, we

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:35.847 align:middle line:84%
have to keep our
boundaries up so stiff.

00:30:35.847 --> 00:30:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And when somebody
else is experiencing

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:39.573 align:middle line:84%
something difficult,
I can't go near that.

00:30:39.573 --> 00:30:41.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And to be trained
to hold space for one another,

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:44.120 align:middle line:90%
and to know, it's OK.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.670 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you're
unsafe because somebody is

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:49.260 align:middle line:90%
having a meltdown or whatnot.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: That's exactly right
because we are capable enough

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:55.650 align:middle line:84%
of holding even that because we
are not just physical things,

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and emotions are not
supposed to be controlled.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.770 align:middle line:84%
They're supposed to be
experienced, processed as part

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:01.770 align:middle line:90%
of our human experience.

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, let's get
into this for just a moment

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.550 align:middle line:84%
because one of the final
areas was our own fears

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:08.730 align:middle line:84%
and emotions being projected
onto some future reality that

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:11.320 align:middle line:84%
hasn't happened, and
we start breaking down.

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So let's say that's
happening with someone.

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:15.300 align:middle line:84%
They become overwhelmed
by something,

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.760 align:middle line:84%
and they're starting
to appear mentally

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.220 align:middle line:90%
unstable to those around them.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.740 align:middle line:84%
In a case like that,
for every one of us,

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:28.720 align:middle line:84%
what would you say is probably
the most productive way

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.340 align:middle line:90%
to engage with them?

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:32.073 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's
all very different.

00:31:32.073 --> 00:31:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: Yeah, it is
all very different,

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:38.790 align:middle line:84%
but what comes to mind is space,
compassion, and curiosity.

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Inquiry.

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Listen.

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Yeah.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:41.860 align:middle line:90%
It's saying, I see you.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:43.330 align:middle line:90%
You're having an experience.

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:44.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm having an experience.

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening in
your experience, you know?

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:51.160 align:middle line:84%
Rather than putting a
value judgment on it.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or saying,
calm down, calm down.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:55.240 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to be afraid of.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: I'll give you a
story that happened in the ER

00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:58.780 align:middle line:90%
many years ago.

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:02.670 align:middle line:84%
There was a person that
came in who was suicidal.

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:04.980 align:middle line:84%
It was a gentleman, a
middle-aged gentleman.

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, I said,
hey, I'm Dr. Kumar.

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:09.723 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what's going on.

00:32:09.723 --> 00:32:10.890 align:middle line:90%
And then he started talking.

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know,
Doc, you know, I just--

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.300 align:middle line:90%
I feel like killing myself.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.250 align:middle line:90%
And you know, it's hard at home.

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:19.412 align:middle line:84%
And you know, my wife
is always hard on me.

00:32:19.412 --> 00:32:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, I'm trying, and
I'm trying to pay the bills.

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:24.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to hold it together,
but nothing is working.

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And at some point when he
started talking, maybe 20,

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:29.400 align:middle line:84%
30 seconds into it, I
got this kind of message,

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.370 align:middle line:84%
which was just like, just
let him talk and don't--

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:33.995 align:middle line:84%
there's no need to
say anything, right?

00:32:33.995 --> 00:32:35.745 align:middle line:84%
And now in the ER, you
have to understand,

00:32:35.745 --> 00:32:37.920 align:middle line:84%
at any moment you could get
called because something

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:38.970 align:middle line:90%
else just came in, right?

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:40.500 align:middle line:84%
So you never know
when you're going

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.530 align:middle line:84%
to have 12 seconds, 20
seconds, three minutes.

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:47.130 align:middle line:84%
But somehow I had maybe seven,
eight minutes with this person.

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:48.580 align:middle line:90%
And I just let him talk.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And he talked, and he cried,
and he talked, and he cried,

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:52.410 align:middle line:90%
and he talked, and he cried.

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And at the end,
there was a release.

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:56.610 align:middle line:90%
And then he said, thanks, Doc.

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't done anything
in terms of saying anything,

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.720 align:middle line:84%
but I had held space,
and that was healing.

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: And you asked
me what I would do.

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:09.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think that's the
biggest thing, is give people

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:11.587 align:middle line:90%
space because I think--

00:33:11.587 --> 00:33:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Don't be afraid.

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:14.378 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: --there is
an intelligence here.

00:33:14.378 --> 00:33:15.905 align:middle line:84%
There's an
intelligence in space.

00:33:15.905 --> 00:33:17.530 align:middle line:84%
There's an intelligence
in relationship

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:21.340 align:middle line:84%
that is so far deeper and more
powerful than conceptual and

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:23.350 align:middle line:90%
verbal intelligence.

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:25.900 align:middle line:84%
So I would say, allow
that to come in.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:26.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.520 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.640 align:middle line:90%
And so also, there was a woman--

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.810 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to get to that.

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Because of the way you see
things when you're in the ER

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:39.490 align:middle line:84%
and you can feel the kind of
preceding events in one's life

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:43.120 align:middle line:84%
that brought them there,
there was an old woman

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.490 align:middle line:84%
in delicate condition
that came in one time

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:47.200 align:middle line:84%
that we were talking
about a while back.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit
about that experience

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:52.600 align:middle line:84%
and who you were able
to show up as to her.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: It was such a
beautiful experience, Regina.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:56.900 align:middle line:90%
It was my intern year.

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.500 align:middle line:84%
So I had been dealing
with all of these things

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.110 align:middle line:84%
that I told you I was dealing
with, not knowing what is up

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:04.320 align:middle line:90%
and what is down.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I still remember, I had
a fresh white coat on.

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:08.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was starched.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.750 align:middle line:84%
It was crisp, to the
point where you're like,

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:12.000 align:middle line:90%
this person has no experience.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.620 align:middle line:84%
That coat is way
too clean, you know?

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And I went to see this
lady with abdominal pain.

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:17.409 align:middle line:90%
I think she was in her 80s.

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:18.820 align:middle line:90%
She was an elderly lady.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And she was in a
stretcher, laying back.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Her head-- the stretcher
was almost flat, I think.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.375 align:middle line:84%
Maybe just a little
bit of angle.

00:34:25.375 --> 00:34:29.169 align:middle line:84%
And I walked in, this
clumsy, like, fresh intern--

00:34:29.169 --> 00:34:29.969 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Kid.

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:30.900 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Yeah, a kid.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.370 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'm 20-something.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:33.270 align:middle line:90%
She's 80-something.

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Like, what am I going to
teach this person about life,

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:35.570 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:37.500 align:middle line:90%
And so I said--

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.038 align:middle line:84%
again, I said,
hello, I'm Dr. Kumar.

00:34:39.038 --> 00:34:40.080 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what's happening.

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:41.100 align:middle line:90%
And it was just quiet.

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Like, no response, you know?

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:46.168 align:middle line:84%
And then she slowly kind
of raised herself up,

00:34:46.168 --> 00:34:48.210 align:middle line:84%
and she was kind of
trembling, I remember, right?

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:50.125 align:middle line:90%
So her head's trembling.

00:34:50.125 --> 00:34:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Her body's trembling.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And then she starts to reach
out a trembling hand like this.

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:57.450 align:middle line:90%
And I had a clipboard then.

00:34:57.450 --> 00:35:00.420 align:middle line:84%
This was before we moved to
the electronic medical record.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.920 align:middle line:90%
I had a clipboard and a pen.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.890 align:middle line:90%
And she reached out for my hand.

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:05.740 align:middle line:90%
And so I gave her my hand.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.420 align:middle line:84%
She took my hand,
and she looked at me,

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:11.395 align:middle line:84%
and she's like,
you are so loving.

00:35:11.395 --> 00:35:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of the most
deep, beautiful, true moments,

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:21.040 align:middle line:84%
maybe the most of my
medical career so far.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.600 align:middle line:90%
In that moment--

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting goosebumps.

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:28.750 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, I knew
she was 100% right.

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:29.890 align:middle line:90%
100% right.

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:32.080 align:middle line:84%
Whereas some other
times, we might

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:34.900 align:middle line:84%
be tempted to say, oh, no,
you know, I'm not that loving.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.520 align:middle line:84%
But I felt the
falseness in that--

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.410 align:middle line:84%
in that kind of
response, and I just

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:40.310 align:middle line:90%
felt the truth in what she said.

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:41.410 align:middle line:90%
I was like, I knew.

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:44.170 align:middle line:84%
I was like, yes, I
am incredibly loving.

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And I also knew I
was incredibly loved.

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:47.670 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: You know?

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:49.030 align:middle line:90%
And I knew this person--

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: She could see you.

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:51.720 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: --was a messenger
of love also, right?

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: And so we stood
frozen in that moment,

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:58.088 align:middle line:84%
and then everything
went to light.

00:35:58.088 --> 00:35:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Everything went to light.

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:02.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember a single thing
after that, of that night,

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:04.140 align:middle line:90%
of anything else.

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:09.000 align:middle line:84%
But the amount of gratitude
and love I have for her

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.318 align:middle line:84%
is inexpressible because in a
sense, I needed that so badly.

00:36:13.318 --> 00:36:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You needed
to be recognized

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.122 align:middle line:90%
in the heat of the ER.

00:36:16.122 --> 00:36:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: I needed that.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.460 align:middle line:84%
With everything I was going
through in that moment,

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:20.380 align:middle line:90%
I needed that.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of showed
me how much I could do

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:26.050 align:middle line:90%
and what I could do.

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:28.075 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm-hmm.

00:36:28.075 --> 00:36:32.350 align:middle line:84%
So now we come to kind
of the big picture.

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Health revolution, systems
revolution has to happen.

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:39.760 align:middle line:90%
We all know that.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.980 align:middle line:90%
Where do we even begin?

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And are you seeing
any kind of change

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:50.110 align:middle line:84%
in the nature of the young
people coming into medicine

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:52.910 align:middle line:90%
today for better or worse?

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Yeah.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:54.955 align:middle line:90%
We definitely are seeing it.

00:36:54.955 --> 00:36:56.330 align:middle line:84%
We're definitely
seeing a change.

00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:57.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look at
the system today.

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.538 align:middle line:84%
You can't go to a
major medical center

00:36:59.538 --> 00:37:01.330 align:middle line:84%
without there being an
integrative medicine

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:03.670 align:middle line:84%
program or a complementary
medicine program.

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:05.650 align:middle line:84%
All the major medical
schools have it.

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:08.020 align:middle line:84%
That itself, there is a
seismic shift happening.

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, we don't fully
understand what that is.

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:13.247 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand the basis of
that science, which is actually

00:37:13.247 --> 00:37:14.455 align:middle line:90%
the primacy of consciousness.

00:37:14.455 --> 00:37:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, doesn't the
doctor usually say, well,

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.290 align:middle line:84%
you can go over and
get some-- you're

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:19.270 align:middle line:84%
covered for a few
acupuncture sessions,

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:20.770 align:middle line:90%
and let us know how it goes.

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:23.650 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: Because it's still a
materialist physical framework

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:26.230 align:middle line:84%
and they're trying to do
this as an addendum, right?

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:28.180 align:middle line:84%
But rather than
seeing consciousness

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:31.560 align:middle line:84%
as fundamental and primary
and physicality as expression,

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.070 align:middle line:84%
which then holds
all of medicine,

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:37.625 align:middle line:84%
all of healing, all systems
around the world beautifully.

00:37:37.625 --> 00:37:40.640 align:middle line:84%
So yes, it is changing, and
people now are changing.

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.260 align:middle line:84%
The people coming
in are changing.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:43.860 align:middle line:90%
They're open to more ideas.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.740 align:middle line:84%
I see it even in my
younger colleagues.

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:48.200 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
interested-- one of my books

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.930 align:middle line:84%
is called "Is This a Dream?" and
they're like, oh, interesting,

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:51.380 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And the other one's
"Michelangelo's Medicine."

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:53.860 align:middle line:90%
Oh, interesting.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:54.710 align:middle line:90%
What's that about?

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:57.360 align:middle line:84%
They're much more open-minded
and curious about what

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:58.160 align:middle line:90%
this means.

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And they know there's more
than this medical system,

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:04.070 align:middle line:84%
but not knowing yet
how to integrate it.

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:05.780 align:middle line:90%
So yes, I see a lot of hope.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:07.730 align:middle line:90%
I see a lot of change happening.

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:11.075 align:middle line:84%
The huge step now, which
is what I'm here for,

00:38:11.075 --> 00:38:15.230 align:middle line:84%
is now to shift from a model
of the primacy of the body

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and matter to a model where
consciousness is fundamental

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:21.045 align:middle line:90%
and expresses as the body.

00:38:21.045 --> 00:38:21.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.870 align:middle line:84%
You've talked with
Deepak Chopra about this,

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:26.180 align:middle line:84%
I know, on one of his
programs, and you're

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:29.300 align:middle line:84%
speaking to many people
through many venues about this.

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I see you as a voice
that's going to rise and rise

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:34.500 align:middle line:84%
because it's
absolutely necessary.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And you chose to come back from
taking that step into the light

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:39.900 align:middle line:90%
to do this very thing.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.770 align:middle line:84%
But there's another
thing that has to occur.

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes,
the negative side

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:49.220 align:middle line:84%
as a customer or client
of the medical industry, I

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:53.270 align:middle line:84%
become very frustrated at the
arrogance of thinking they

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:55.440 align:middle line:90%
know my body better than I do.

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And they have a few
minutes with me,

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:59.370 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
tell me what's needed.

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:02.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't like that, and
nor does anybody else

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:04.460 align:middle line:84%
where you feel you're
not being heard.

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Is there a step in here
somewhere where people

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.670 align:middle line:84%
can start making
themselves heard and known

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:12.440 align:middle line:84%
to their doctors,
or is it impossible

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.570 align:middle line:84%
because of the nature
of the HMO where you get

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:16.730 align:middle line:90%
five minutes with a patient?

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: At the level--

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.913 align:middle line:84%
so at the level
of being a human,

00:39:20.913 --> 00:39:22.580 align:middle line:84%
the doctor and the
patient are the same.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:23.810 align:middle line:90%
We're both humans.

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:27.710 align:middle line:84%
We both have emotions, feelings,
desires, strengths, weaknesses,

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:28.910 align:middle line:90%
everything, right?

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:31.775 align:middle line:84%
And then there's your
training on top of that.

00:39:31.775 --> 00:39:34.250 align:middle line:84%
So the patient is
actually a kind of role

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:35.520 align:middle line:90%
that a person takes on, right?

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.320 align:middle line:90%
The patient role.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.250 align:middle line:84%
When I have a
certain experience,

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.910 align:middle line:84%
and now that
experience is framed

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:44.520 align:middle line:84%
in the context of a symptom of
a disease, that's kind of a role

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:45.320 align:middle line:90%
the person takes.

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor then also
takes on a certain training

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:48.560 align:middle line:90%
to be a doctor.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.510 align:middle line:84%
So you have the human
beings and you have

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:51.920 align:middle line:90%
the roles that they're playing.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:55.650 align:middle line:84%
The role of the doctor
is grossly undereducated.

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: That's the problem.

00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:58.580 align:middle line:90%
And this gets back to anatomy.

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.530 align:middle line:84%
When you're
experiencing yourself,

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:03.180 align:middle line:84%
you don't experience
yourself as primarily a body.

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:03.980 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's a
multidimensional experience.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: How many people hearing
this right now are experiencing

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:08.580 align:middle line:90%
their left third toe?

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:11.505 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: Almost nobody,
unless you have pain there.

00:40:11.505 --> 00:40:14.000 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at an anatomy
textbook, it's right there.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.950 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the same anatomy
textbook, love is not there.

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:17.850 align:middle line:90%
Fear is not there.

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:18.690 align:middle line:90%
Hope is not there.

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:20.010 align:middle line:90%
Ambition is not there.

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:21.240 align:middle line:90%
Possibility is not there.

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:22.230 align:middle line:90%
Potential is not there.

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:23.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Soul is not there.

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Soul is not there.

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.467 align:middle line:84%
But the way we experience
ourselves, like,

00:40:26.467 --> 00:40:28.050 align:middle line:84%
what people are
experiencing right now

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:32.717 align:middle line:84%
is probably curiosity or
wonder or doubt or possibility.

00:40:32.717 --> 00:40:34.800 align:middle line:84%
That's what people are
experiencing as themselves.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Not the third toe, not the
liver, not the left nostril,

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:39.690 align:middle line:90%
not the right eyelid, right?

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:41.970 align:middle line:84%
So there's a huge
discrepancy between how

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:46.050 align:middle line:84%
the doctor is trained
to see us and how

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:47.860 align:middle line:90%
we are experiencing ourselves.

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's what needs to
be reconciled with a more

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:52.170 align:middle line:90%
complete model of anatomy.

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:55.080 align:middle line:84%
In terms of what
we can do now, it

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.930 align:middle line:84%
has to be a doctor who
is seeing themselves

00:40:57.930 --> 00:41:00.780 align:middle line:84%
primarily as a human
being, who has a training

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:03.060 align:middle line:84%
rather than strictly as a
doctor, because then you

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:05.580 align:middle line:84%
can associate with more
of what this person is.

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And also, the person
who's being seen, staying

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:12.510 align:middle line:84%
grounded in who they are
and not allowing themselves

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:14.970 align:middle line:90%
to be seen as only a body.

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:15.770 align:middle line:90%
Both are needed.

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:17.187 align:middle line:84%
That's what we can
do immediately,

00:41:17.187 --> 00:41:19.418 align:middle line:84%
and that's a challenge
because of the training today.

00:41:19.418 --> 00:41:21.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when you have--
you see the young docs in the ER

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:26.070 align:middle line:84%
now, are you able in
any kind of active way

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:30.345 align:middle line:84%
to subtly teach or
participate with them

00:41:30.345 --> 00:41:34.390 align:middle line:84%
to see the person in front
of them as more than a body?

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: So before the pandemic,
we were doing meditations

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:39.610 align:middle line:90%
when we would explore this.

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:40.410 align:middle line:90%
So there would be--

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In the hospital?

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:41.640 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: In the hospital.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:41.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>>KUMAR: I was
doing meditations.

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:44.370 align:middle line:90%
And we would talk about--

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:46.620 align:middle line:84%
we might pick a
topic like harmony

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:49.680 align:middle line:84%
and then talk about what
that's like in an ER, which

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:52.555 align:middle line:84%
seems to be so disharmonic
in many ways, right?

00:41:52.555 --> 00:41:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So chaotic.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Or even balance.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.800 align:middle line:90%
What does balance mean?

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.662 align:middle line:84%
And talk about that in
the context of an ER.

00:41:57.662 --> 00:41:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So we were doing those
kinds of sessions.

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Post-pandemic, we
have not done those,

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.100 align:middle line:84%
but I tend to have private
conversations with--

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.620 align:middle line:84%
when you're working
with a colleague about--

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.170 align:middle line:84%
and it generally takes
the form of wellness

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:11.550 align:middle line:90%
or it takes the form of--

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:13.050 align:middle line:90%
about meditation.

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:15.630 align:middle line:84%
But where all of this
is going ultimately

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:18.870 align:middle line:84%
is a deeper, more
complete model of anatomy

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:20.290 align:middle line:90%
and the nature of consciousness.

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:22.123 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how do you
see, in your biggest

00:42:22.123 --> 00:42:27.410 align:middle line:84%
dream and your life playing out,
your role in what you can do?

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:29.910 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: My role is twofold.

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:33.890 align:middle line:84%
One, to make it safe for
people to see consciousness

00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:35.780 align:middle line:84%
as fundamental,
because it's scary,

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and people think it's
irrational, and people think it

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:41.210 align:middle line:84%
contradicts science, all
of which are false, right?

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:44.450 align:middle line:10%
It actually enhances
science, and it actually

00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:47.060 align:middle line:10%
enhances our own potential
and possibility of healing

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:48.620 align:middle line:10%
and so much else.

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.470 align:middle line:84%
That's one, to give
people an off-ramp

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:54.590 align:middle line:84%
from the insanity of
the primacy of matter

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:56.190 align:middle line:90%
and the primacy of the body.

00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Second, having taken
that off-ramp to then

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:05.090 align:middle line:84%
start to experience this because
that's where I like to live.

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:06.420 align:middle line:90%
That's where I live.

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And so if you meet me
here, we can explore this

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:13.220 align:middle line:84%
and live in this together and
make this space for everyone.

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.570 align:middle line:90%
I love what you're doing.

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for coming back from
that glorious saffron light.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:19.998 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:19.998 --> 00:43:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And I know we're going to
have more conversations

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.960 align:middle line:84%
because you're building
a lot right now.

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:27.390 align:middle line:84%
So when we go to your website,
it's under your name, right?

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:28.420 align:middle line:90%
That's easy enough.

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Healthrevolution.org.

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, OK.

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:31.580 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:34.380 align:middle line:10%
>>KUMAR: Healthrevolution.org
is where I'm focused right now.

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:34.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very good.

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:36.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And then again, people can find
your books there and elsewhere.

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:43.152 align:middle line:84%
So thank you, Dr. Kumar, so
much for joining us today.

00:43:43.152 --> 00:43:45.360 align:middle line:84%
I've really been looking
forward to this conversation

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.040 align:middle line:84%
and to your newest
book coming out.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.300 align:middle line:90%
>>KUMAR: Thank you, Regina.

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:51.030 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: To follow Dr. Kumar,
you can go to his website

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:54.120 align:middle line:10%
at healthrevolution.org
where you can find his blogs

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.560 align:middle line:10%
on consciousness and healing.

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, we're going
to have Dr. Kumar back

00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:01.770 align:middle line:84%
to discuss the ideas for a true
health revolution, which we all

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:05.100 align:middle line:84%
need to be part of, one that
gives human beings the courage

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:09.210 align:middle line:84%
to have faith in the genius of
their own body, mind, heart,

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:10.020 align:middle line:90%
and soul.

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank
you for joining us here

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:13.980 align:middle line:90%
on "Open Minds."

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:17.330 align:middle line:90%
