more divisiveness

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.924 align:middle line:90%
in today's world than hunting.

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've all come a long
way in our ability to weigh

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.996 align:middle line:84%
in on the factors of
conservancy, animal rights

00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:31.766 align:middle line:84%
and human need, there're
still highly emotional charges

00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.701 align:middle line:90%

Tovar Cerulli has stepped right
into the center of the debate.

Once a vegan, he's now
what he refers to as a

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.343 align:middle line:84%
"Mindful Carnivore" and
he's here to share his story

00:00:42.343 --> 00:00:45.146 align:middle line:84%
which portions of it are
difficult for some people.

00:00:45.146 --> 00:00:47.615 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to come to grips
with this as you have.

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:52.086 align:middle line:84%
But as a man, your deep
tradition has been in the world

00:00:52.086 --> 00:00:55.723 align:middle line:84%
of fishing and hunting
before you became a vegan.

00:00:55.723 --> 00:00:57.958 align:middle line:84%
So I think we need to
start with the beginning

00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.928 align:middle line:84%
of your story 'cause it gets
more intense as we get into it.

00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:02.263 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:01:02.263 --> 00:01:04.532 align:middle line:84%
>> So how-- when you were a
little kid, you were fishing

00:01:04.532 --> 00:01:06.200 align:middle line:84%
with your dad's friend
name, Willie?

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.268 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-hmm.

00:01:07.268 --> 00:01:08.669 align:middle line:84%
>> And this was a big
part of your life.

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:11.939 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about how your
life started out and how organic

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.774 align:middle line:84%
that may have been
and how natural it may

00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:14.775 align:middle line:90%
or may not have been for you.

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:16.177 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-hmm.

00:01:16.177 --> 00:01:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you know, as a kid I spent
a lot of time in the outdoors,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.382 align:middle line:90%
in the summers in New England

00:01:21.382 --> 00:01:24.385 align:middle line:84%
and fishing was a
wonderful experience for me,

00:01:24.385 --> 00:01:27.521 align:middle line:84%
and Willie was a
wonderful mentor.

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:31.292 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't something that
I was reflective about as,

00:01:31.292 --> 00:01:34.461 align:middle line:84%
you know, a 4 or
6, 8, 10 year old.

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:35.796 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:01:35.796 --> 00:01:40.968 align:middle line:84%
>> But it felt quite, you know,
quite protocol and natural

00:01:40.968 --> 00:01:44.972 align:middle line:84%
and affirming for me to be
able to get food from the land,

00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:46.640 align:middle line:90%
from the water in that case.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.677 align:middle line:84%
So that was a-- was a
wonderful experience.

00:01:49.677 --> 00:01:55.683 align:middle line:84%
As a boy, I didn't do any
hunting except for, you know,

00:01:55.683 --> 00:01:57.518 align:middle line:90%
catching some frogs as a kid.

00:01:57.518 --> 00:02:00.888 align:middle line:84%
So it was-- it was pretty much
a fishing experience as a boy.

00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:04.592 align:middle line:84%
>> And then later on you came
across or were given a BB gun

00:02:04.592 --> 00:02:08.395 align:middle line:84%
and then it kind-- things kind
of accelerated a little bit

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:09.997 align:middle line:84%
from there in terms
of the breath

00:02:09.997 --> 00:02:12.800 align:middle line:84%
of which what you could connect
with or what you could hunt.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.569 align:middle line:84%
How did-- how did the
BB figure into it?

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.605 align:middle line:84%
>> You know what,
what it primary is,

00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:20.808 align:middle line:84%
it changed the possibilities
in terms of a--

00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:23.010 align:middle line:84%
well, my occasional
outing is to catch frogs.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.846 align:middle line:84%
Mostly I just planked the tin
can or something like that.

00:02:25.846 --> 00:02:31.619 align:middle line:84%
But it did change, rather
than having to swim around

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:35.356 align:middle line:84%
and catch a kind of
weary bullfrog by hand,

00:02:35.356 --> 00:02:39.059 align:middle line:84%
I have the option
of using a BB gun

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:42.997 align:middle line:84%
and being five yards
away and taking a shot.

00:02:42.997 --> 00:02:44.865 align:middle line:84%
And so it changed
technologically.

00:02:44.865 --> 00:02:48.302 align:middle line:84%
It changed that process
quite a bit.

00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:51.205 align:middle line:84%
>> But as a kid that you were
so pretty comfortable with that.

00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:53.407 align:middle line:84%
I mean every boy had
BB guns around their--

00:02:53.407 --> 00:02:54.808 align:middle line:90%
at the time I assumed.

00:02:54.808 --> 00:02:58.279 align:middle line:84%
I remember I was shot right here
with a BB gun when I was little.

00:02:58.279 --> 00:02:59.146 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah [laughs].

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:00.014 align:middle line:84%
>> [Laughs] With
my neighbor boy.

00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:02.016 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, yeah, I was--

00:03:02.016 --> 00:03:03.584 align:middle line:84%
I didn't, again,
it was reflective--

00:03:03.584 --> 00:03:04.418 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:04.418 --> 00:03:05.486 align:middle line:90%
>> -- about that process either.

00:03:05.486 --> 00:03:07.354 align:middle line:84%
It was, you know,
part of getting food.

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:11.225 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really
think much more about it.

00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:13.727 align:middle line:84%
>> And didn't you and
Willie kind of once you--

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:16.664 align:middle line:84%
once you caught your fish,
you'd had a nice little fry

00:03:16.664 --> 00:03:18.465 align:middle line:90%
out then you have fresh fish?

00:03:18.465 --> 00:03:19.733 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh sure, sure, you know.

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:21.068 align:middle line:90%
>> So.

00:03:21.068 --> 00:03:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>> It was, you know, minutes
or you know, it took me less

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.140 align:middle line:84%
than an hour from
water to plate,

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.576 align:middle line:84%
and so we enjoyed the
eating as well, yeah.

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think I have
ever experienced the taste

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.181 align:middle line:90%
of a fresh fish.

00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:39.019 align:middle line:84%
But my understanding is it's a--
it's a different octave in terms

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:44.425 align:middle line:84%
of the flavor and the-- just the
aliveness of the fish itself.

00:03:44.425 --> 00:03:47.895 align:middle line:84%
When you-- have you ever
eaten cultivated fish

00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:50.230 align:middle line:90%
from a grocery store?

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.198 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I have.

00:03:51.198 --> 00:03:52.299 align:middle line:90%
I think there is a difference.

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.134 align:middle line:84%
It depends a lot on
the kind of fish.

00:03:54.134 --> 00:03:55.469 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-hmm.

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:58.372 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether they're oily or
not, how well they keep or not.

00:03:58.372 --> 00:04:01.275 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, fresh fish is a
different I think altogether.

00:04:01.275 --> 00:04:02.943 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, altogether.

00:04:02.943 --> 00:04:05.512 align:middle line:84%
[laughs] Well, it's interesting
because as time went on,

00:04:05.512 --> 00:04:08.215 align:middle line:84%
as you became a young
man and then went

00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:11.018 align:middle line:84%
into your collage years, you
start being exposed to a lot

00:04:11.018 --> 00:04:12.319 align:middle line:90%
of other philosophies.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.254 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was
vegetarianism,

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:17.757 align:middle line:84%
the philosophy of, you know,
do no harm and so forth.

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:21.261 align:middle line:84%
So now, give us an idea of
what happened in that part

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.396 align:middle line:90%
of the journey for you.

00:04:22.396 --> 00:04:24.598 align:middle line:84%
Who you were exposed to,
what you are exposed to

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:26.700 align:middle line:84%
and how you took
that information on?

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.802 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, first I
started just getting

00:04:28.802 --> 00:04:30.003 align:middle line:90%
to know vegetarians.

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:31.372 align:middle line:90%
I haven't known that many.

00:04:31.372 --> 00:04:35.442 align:middle line:84%
I mean my parents
were part of the sort

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:39.113 align:middle line:90%
of 60s, 70s counterculture.

00:04:39.113 --> 00:04:40.114 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-hmm.

00:04:40.114 --> 00:04:41.348 align:middle line:84%
>> So I knew vegetarians
and, you know,

00:04:41.348 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:90%
I ate tofu on occasions.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.821 align:middle line:84%
But my girlfriend late
in high school she

00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:49.523 align:middle line:84%
and her family were
all vegetarian.

00:04:49.523 --> 00:04:50.624 align:middle line:90%
That was fine with me.

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I enjoyed the food that
we shared together.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:01.268 align:middle line:84%
And yet for me, the shift
didn't come until I was 20

00:05:01.268 --> 00:05:03.470 align:middle line:90%
and it was back to fishing.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:09.176 align:middle line:84%
I had been at a week long
retreat with Thich Nhat Hanh

00:05:09.176 --> 00:05:12.312 align:middle line:84%
and really doing mindfulness
meditation including related

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.648 align:middle line:84%
to food and they were
certain vegetarian food

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:16.984 align:middle line:84%
and he talked about
vegetarianism.

00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:21.021 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes shortly
thereafter I went fishing

00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:25.325 align:middle line:84%
as I had done many times as
a kid and caught this trout

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:30.564 align:middle line:84%
and brought it to, you know,
to the cutting board and it was

00:05:30.564 --> 00:05:33.634 align:middle line:84%
in that moment and that's how I
opened the book, is that scene

00:05:33.634 --> 00:05:39.907 align:middle line:84%
of pausing and realizing, you
know, I don't need to do this.

00:05:39.907 --> 00:05:42.076 align:middle line:84%
And the fish is already out
in the water and already dying

00:05:42.076 --> 00:05:46.814 align:middle line:84%
and I did kill it, but I felt
a lot of regret in that moment

00:05:46.814 --> 00:05:48.215 align:middle line:84%
and realized I could
have had rice,

00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:49.116 align:middle line:90%
I could have had vegetables.

00:05:49.116 --> 00:05:50.484 align:middle line:90%
I could have had something else.

00:05:50.484 --> 00:05:54.588 align:middle line:84%
This fish did not need to die
or experience being caught.

00:05:54.588 --> 00:05:57.758 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided then
that was, you know,

00:05:57.758 --> 00:06:01.128 align:middle line:84%
the end of eating other
creatures, flesh, you know.

00:06:01.128 --> 00:06:05.332 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't take too long to
get to veganism, thereafter.

00:06:05.332 --> 00:06:06.700 align:middle line:90%
>> And from there.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.971 align:middle line:84%
>> From a place of compassion
and animal welfare concerns

00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:13.440 align:middle line:84%
of then extended to
environmental impacts

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.276 align:middle line:84%
of the meat industry and, you
know, other places as well.

00:06:16.276 --> 00:06:20.113 align:middle line:84%
>> So, through education it
seemed like a logical step

00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:22.015 align:middle line:84%
for you at that time
and I understand that.

00:06:22.015 --> 00:06:25.319 align:middle line:84%
I did it in the blinding flash
for the exact same reason.

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:28.689 align:middle line:84%
And it had more to do with,
you have a quote in your book

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:31.291 align:middle line:84%
from Gandhi, "The life of
a lamb is no less precious

00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:34.761 align:middle line:84%
than the life of a human,"
right, and it goes on from there

00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:38.265 align:middle line:84%
and that is what the experience
I had besides a couple

00:06:38.265 --> 00:06:39.366 align:middle line:90%
of strange ones.

00:06:39.366 --> 00:06:42.936 align:middle line:84%
[laughs] It was just
kind of embarrassing.

00:06:42.936 --> 00:06:45.239 align:middle line:90%
Frying chicken, one time

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:48.442 align:middle line:84%
and in fact I would say I was
smoking pot when I was cooking

00:06:48.442 --> 00:06:53.080 align:middle line:84%
so at that time I heard the
chicken legs screaming at me

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.883 align:middle line:84%
when I put them in the frying
pan and I couldn't get rid

00:06:55.883 --> 00:06:59.486 align:middle line:84%
of that sense that
these legs were walking

00:06:59.486 --> 00:07:01.889 align:middle line:84%
around just a short
time before that.

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:03.991 align:middle line:84%
And that was kind
of the beginning

00:07:03.991 --> 00:07:06.493 align:middle line:84%
and for me the understanding
of the [inaudible] industry

00:07:06.493 --> 00:07:09.229 align:middle line:84%
and how they were
raising these little cubs.

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:13.500 align:middle line:84%
So, when it culminated like
you I just quit overnight

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.371 align:middle line:84%
which was not an easy thing
to do in the day because you--

00:07:17.371 --> 00:07:21.341 align:middle line:84%
it's a big learning curve
for your body, for your mind

00:07:21.341 --> 00:07:24.344 align:middle line:84%
to gather your foods, and
what was that like for you

00:07:24.344 --> 00:07:26.847 align:middle line:84%
when you did that, when
you just cut it off?

00:07:26.847 --> 00:07:29.082 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I didn't find
it that difficult partly

00:07:29.082 --> 00:07:32.185 align:middle line:84%
because I'd already been
exposed to vegetarian food

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:34.021 align:middle line:84%
of various kinds and,
you know, a large part

00:07:34.021 --> 00:07:36.023 align:middle line:84%
of my diet did not
include, you know,

00:07:36.023 --> 00:07:38.625 align:middle line:90%
meat and fish and so on already.

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:42.763 align:middle line:84%
So, I didn't really have much
difficulty with that process

00:07:42.763 --> 00:07:44.097 align:middle line:84%
of just changing
the diet and coping.

00:07:44.097 --> 00:07:45.198 align:middle line:90%
>> What year was that roughly?

00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:46.433 align:middle line:90%
>> It was 91.

00:07:46.433 --> 00:07:47.166 align:middle line:90%
>> Okay.

00:07:47.166 --> 00:07:49.436 align:middle line:90%
>> 1991 early 90s so.

00:07:49.436 --> 00:07:52.339 align:middle line:84%
>> So vegetarianism was already
well underway by that time

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:53.307 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah, oh yeah, absolutely.

00:07:53.307 --> 00:07:53.874 align:middle line:84%
>> So there were
cookbooks, I mean--

00:07:53.874 --> 00:07:55.275 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:07:55.275 --> 00:07:56.543 align:middle line:84%
>> That makes a lot easier once
you have some guides out there.

00:07:56.543 --> 00:07:58.845 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. I had tradition
behind me, you know?

00:07:58.845 --> 00:08:05.452 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes. [laughs] And so, it
wasn't a small leap then largely

00:08:05.452 --> 00:08:08.288 align:middle line:84%
for you to decide that if
you're going to take this on

00:08:08.288 --> 00:08:11.758 align:middle line:84%
and embrace it then you needed
to go with your own gardening

00:08:11.758 --> 00:08:14.027 align:middle line:84%
and taking responsibility
for your own food.

00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:15.896 align:middle line:90%
It's a very conscious journey.

00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:17.497 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
what happened from there

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:21.602 align:middle line:84%
when you decided to unplug from
the industrial agribusiness.

00:08:21.602 --> 00:08:26.473 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean I think that
I would be sort of arrogant

00:08:26.473 --> 00:08:28.575 align:middle line:84%
or maybe a lot of foods
[inaudible] say that I unplugged

00:08:28.575 --> 00:08:31.111 align:middle line:84%
from industry agribusiness
is very hard thing to do.

00:08:31.111 --> 00:08:36.782 align:middle line:84%
And I actually in my early
20s, my last year of college,

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:37.851 align:middle line:84%
I was living in New
York City and,

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:38.785 align:middle line:90%
you know, I wasn't gardening.

00:08:38.785 --> 00:08:39.619 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:40.988 align:middle line:90%
>> I could be occasionally at--

00:08:40.988 --> 00:08:43.056 align:middle line:84%
to a Farmer's Market in Union
Square, but you know, I was,

00:08:43.056 --> 00:08:45.626 align:middle line:84%
you know, getting organic
produce when I could

00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:49.496 align:middle line:84%
and it was still I
think fairly industrial.

00:08:49.496 --> 00:08:53.567 align:middle line:84%
But when I left the city
and when my current wife

00:08:53.567 --> 00:08:56.570 align:middle line:84%
and I got together, she'd
been gardening for a long time

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.939 align:middle line:84%
and I had some experience
as a kid gardening.

00:08:58.939 --> 00:09:03.610 align:middle line:84%
But for her making a home in
Great Park meant making a garden

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.847 align:middle line:84%
and so we embark
on that together

00:09:06.847 --> 00:09:09.850 align:middle line:84%
and it was a great experience
to have that direct connection

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:15.856 align:middle line:84%
with the earth and the planting
and harvesting our vegetables.

00:09:15.856 --> 00:09:18.625 align:middle line:84%
It'd be some portion of
them right from, you know,

00:09:18.625 --> 00:09:21.595 align:middle line:84%
from our front yard and
so I certainly enjoyed

00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:23.630 align:middle line:90%
that experience.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.898 align:middle line:90%
>> What about the notion

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:29.803 align:middle line:84%
of the commercial
slaughter house industries?

00:09:29.803 --> 00:09:31.838 align:middle line:90%
Where did that figure in?

00:09:31.838 --> 00:09:35.742 align:middle line:84%
I mean one is, thou shall do no
harm or whatnot in your mind,

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:38.578 align:middle line:84%
you know, to unplug from
the notion of the need

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:41.748 align:middle line:84%
to eat animals when there
are other things available.

00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:46.553 align:middle line:84%
But what about the commercial
aspect of anima, not we--

00:09:46.553 --> 00:09:49.756 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't even call it
husbandry, but slaughter house.

00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:52.159 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, and
slaughter house is the end

00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:53.794 align:middle line:84%
but it's the whole
factory farming process.

00:09:53.794 --> 00:09:54.928 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:56.463 align:middle line:84%
>> And the whole life if
one can call it that--

00:09:56.463 --> 00:09:57.664 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:57.664 --> 00:09:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>> A life of, you know,
confinement and suffering.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.770 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, that was
I guess in my mind

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.640 align:middle line:84%
and in some ways still
remains in my mind

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:10.610 align:middle line:90%
with the ultimate disrespect

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.581 align:middle line:84%
and what the philosopher
Val Plumwood, she called it,

00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:17.317 align:middle line:84%
sort of the reduction of
animal lives to living to meat,

00:10:17.317 --> 00:10:19.619 align:middle line:84%
you know, treating
them in that way.

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:24.291 align:middle line:84%
So that was the thing I
am most wanted to avoid.

00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:25.826 align:middle line:90%
I was also avoiding fishing

00:10:25.826 --> 00:10:28.595 align:middle line:84%
and also avoiding even
things I did myself--

00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:29.296 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:29.296 --> 00:10:30.363 align:middle line:90%
>> -- as a vegetarian.

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:34.234 align:middle line:84%
But sure, I mean that
sort of processing

00:10:34.234 --> 00:10:38.805 align:middle line:84%
of lives was what I
wanted to avoid the most.

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:41.742 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. And as your
explorations went on,

00:10:41.742 --> 00:10:46.713 align:middle line:84%
it became really more complex
because now, you're gardening

00:10:46.713 --> 00:10:50.617 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking at the use of
say an herbicide or a pesticide

00:10:50.617 --> 00:10:52.085 align:middle line:90%
or something like this.

00:10:52.085 --> 00:10:55.021 align:middle line:84%
And then you started looking
at the notion of well,

00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:57.324 align:middle line:84%
if you're not going to
kill, what does this mean.

00:10:57.324 --> 00:11:01.094 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm killing the insects
or whatever that are involved,

00:11:01.094 --> 00:11:05.198 align:middle line:84%
that are ravaging my garden and
the protective element comes up.

00:11:05.198 --> 00:11:08.869 align:middle line:84%
So talk about where you
went in all of that.

00:11:08.869 --> 00:11:10.303 align:middle line:90%
>> My first recognitions

00:11:10.303 --> 00:11:17.844 align:middle line:84%
about vegetarianism perhaps not
being quite what I thought it

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:23.750 align:middle line:84%
was-- was reading about
the impacts of agriculture

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.652 align:middle line:84%
in a broad sense not
just my personal garden

00:11:25.652 --> 00:11:27.521 align:middle line:84%
that my wife and
I were attending.

00:11:27.521 --> 00:11:33.059 align:middle line:84%
But the industrial
landscape changed like being

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:34.361 align:middle line:90%
out wild like habitats.

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:35.695 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:36.696 align:middle line:84%
>> You know talk about the
ultimate disrespect of animals.

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.064 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:39.966 align:middle line:84%
>> You've not only wipe them
out but you wiped up their home.

00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:41.468 align:middle line:84%
You potentially wiped
out their species

00:11:41.468 --> 00:11:43.703 align:middle line:90%
if you do it widely enough.

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:48.909 align:middle line:84%
And realizing that large
industrial machinery going

00:11:48.909 --> 00:11:52.112 align:middle line:84%
across farm field, just you
know, chopping up creatures

00:11:52.112 --> 00:11:54.815 align:middle line:84%
and nests and driving
them out of the fields

00:11:54.815 --> 00:11:58.518 align:middle line:84%
where they had settled and
adapted to that habitat.

00:11:58.518 --> 00:12:02.989 align:middle line:84%
I also found leading
that white-tailed deer

00:12:02.989 --> 00:12:06.092 align:middle line:84%
which are the most
common big animal, well,

00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:07.627 align:middle line:84%
cattle too I guess
are more common.

00:12:07.627 --> 00:12:08.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:09.462 align:middle line:90%
>> But just a wide animal

00:12:09.462 --> 00:12:11.631 align:middle line:84%
so that the most common
wild large animal,

00:12:11.631 --> 00:12:16.803 align:middle line:84%
they have rebounded incredibly
over the past century and all

00:12:16.803 --> 00:12:20.974 align:middle line:84%
across the country,
they are shot constantly

00:12:20.974 --> 00:12:26.046 align:middle line:84%
to protect soybean fields,
to protect all kinds of crops

00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:30.050 align:middle line:84%
and that was disturbing, but
I could still distance it

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.185 align:middle line:84%
in some way 'cause like,
well that's somewhere else.

00:12:32.185 --> 00:12:38.391 align:middle line:84%
That's industrial far
away Midwest, you know.

00:12:38.391 --> 00:12:42.729 align:middle line:84%
Then I discovered that well,
the farmer down the road,

00:12:42.729 --> 00:12:44.064 align:middle line:84%
little organic farm
where my wife

00:12:44.064 --> 00:12:46.233 align:middle line:84%
and I would go pick
organic strawberries.

00:12:46.233 --> 00:12:50.003 align:middle line:84%
They shoot deer too and they
smoke bomb woodchuck burrows all

00:12:50.003 --> 00:12:54.574 align:middle line:84%
the time so we can get berries
and kale and whatever else.

00:12:54.574 --> 00:12:56.810 align:middle line:90%
And then the lasts stage,

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.546 align:middle line:84%
the closes to home was
the garden was realizing

00:12:59.546 --> 00:13:02.349 align:middle line:84%
that here the cucumber beetles
wiping up the squash plants.

00:13:02.349 --> 00:13:04.084 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not going
to use pesticides.

00:13:04.084 --> 00:13:05.886 align:middle line:84%
I have to go out there in
the morning when it's cold

00:13:05.886 --> 00:13:08.388 align:middle line:84%
and they are moving kind
of slow and crash them.

00:13:08.388 --> 00:13:09.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:09.222 --> 00:13:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Otherwise they wipe it out.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:10.957 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:15.729 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the sort
of a final encounter

00:13:15.729 --> 00:13:19.532 align:middle line:84%
in that regard was
woodchucks getting

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:21.868 align:middle line:84%
into our garden despite
the fence and everything

00:13:21.868 --> 00:13:25.839 align:middle line:84%
and realizing-- either
I actually take this on

00:13:25.839 --> 00:13:30.844 align:middle line:84%
and kill a woodchuck, or
I keep buying more greens

00:13:30.844 --> 00:13:33.213 align:middle line:84%
from the local farmer
who's killing woodchucks.

00:13:33.213 --> 00:13:37.651 align:middle line:84%
So, I can choose whether I do
it by proxy or do it firsthand

00:13:37.651 --> 00:13:39.986 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to happen,
one way or the other.

00:13:39.986 --> 00:13:42.489 align:middle line:90%
That was uncomfortable.

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:48.828 align:middle line:84%
And in that phase, my wife
and I were still vegetarian.

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:49.763 align:middle line:90%
We're still vegan.

00:13:49.763 --> 00:13:51.031 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-hmm.

00:13:51.031 --> 00:13:54.501 align:middle line:84%
>> But those recognitions
as well as the recognition

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:59.005 align:middle line:84%
that we were fertilizing
our garden with manure

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:04.177 align:middle line:84%
from local cows and
chickens and other animals,

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:06.012 align:middle line:90%
we were definitely involved.

00:14:06.012 --> 00:14:09.082 align:middle line:84%
This is what our
vegetables were eating.

00:14:09.082 --> 00:14:13.186 align:middle line:84%
We'd find a chuck of bone in the
composed, you know, the manure--

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:14.454 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:14.454 --> 00:14:17.624 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like, okay, you know,
we are intimately linked

00:14:17.624 --> 00:14:19.559 align:middle line:90%
with animal life and death.

00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:22.329 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't change
our diet at the point.

00:14:22.329 --> 00:14:27.133 align:middle line:84%
But our ideas are rigid
black and white notions

00:14:27.133 --> 00:14:31.604 align:middle line:84%
about what food ethics meant
and how pure we could be

00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:34.908 align:middle line:84%
and how disconnected we could
be from animal life and death,

00:14:34.908 --> 00:14:37.344 align:middle line:84%
that shifted and
softened at that point.

00:14:37.344 --> 00:14:39.279 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a very complex
web of life.

00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:40.613 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-hmm.

00:14:40.613 --> 00:14:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're right you can't
separate the animal life.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:47.253 align:middle line:84%
And having, I've gone the
distance a few times too

00:14:47.253 --> 00:14:50.156 align:middle line:84%
and when impossible
and had my own garden,

00:14:50.156 --> 00:14:53.760 align:middle line:84%
and one of the things
we did to try to avoid

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.763 align:middle line:84%
that issue is you
do a couple of--

00:14:56.763 --> 00:14:59.933 align:middle line:84%
dig a couple feet
deep and then lined

00:14:59.933 --> 00:15:02.902 align:middle line:90%
up with very fined wire mesh

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:05.472 align:middle line:84%
so that the larger ones
couldn't come up underneath.

00:15:05.472 --> 00:15:06.606 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:15:06.606 --> 00:15:09.009 align:middle line:84%
>> And then depending
on what was in the air,

00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:12.579 align:middle line:84%
maybe even put a little like a
little cage over the top of it.

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:15.281 align:middle line:84%
But the depths and
lengths you have to go to,

00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:18.952 align:middle line:84%
to get a garden growing without
a lot of critters chewing

00:15:18.952 --> 00:15:20.387 align:middle line:90%
on it is pretty extreme.

00:15:20.387 --> 00:15:22.422 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. And our fence
was about a foot or so

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:26.059 align:middle line:84%
down to prevent the easy,
you know, under burrowing.

00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:27.594 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, the gophers
and all that.

00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:31.398 align:middle line:84%
>> But we have very sandy
soil so it's easy digging.

00:15:31.398 --> 00:15:32.866 align:middle line:84%
And so when this
woodchuck burrow popped

00:15:32.866 --> 00:15:35.602 align:middle line:84%
up not near the fence but like
in the middle of the garden.

00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:36.436 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>> You know, I didn't even know

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:38.705 align:middle line:84%
where the other end
of the burrow was.

00:15:38.705 --> 00:15:41.074 align:middle line:84%
They could go deep and long
and they have good aim.

00:15:41.074 --> 00:15:42.275 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah [laughs].

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're here, in
the middle of the garden.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.814 align:middle line:84%
>> And so, as-- so you were
contemplating all of this

00:15:47.814 --> 00:15:52.852 align:middle line:84%
and looking at where do animals
and plants and humans end

00:15:52.852 --> 00:15:55.922 align:middle line:84%
and the other begin and you
realized this a complex.

00:15:55.922 --> 00:15:59.025 align:middle line:84%
But something else was going
on in addition to that,

00:15:59.025 --> 00:16:02.095 align:middle line:84%
you were starting to
really crave animal protein.

00:16:02.095 --> 00:16:03.963 align:middle line:84%
What was going on now
with you and your wife

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:05.598 align:middle line:84%
and your bodies during
this time?

00:16:05.598 --> 00:16:06.399 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-hmm.

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:07.801 align:middle line:90%
>> This is a really big one.

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:10.070 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people watching this
are vegans, even raw foodists

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.073 align:middle line:84%
or vegetarians and I've been
through this whole journey

00:16:13.073 --> 00:16:15.842 align:middle line:84%
over the course of 30 years
that you have as well.

00:16:15.842 --> 00:16:16.476 align:middle line:90%
It's hard.

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.579 align:middle line:84%
>> When you have
philosophical issues at stake.

00:16:19.579 --> 00:16:20.713 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it is.

00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:25.919 align:middle line:84%
I had some health
compelled issues,

00:16:25.919 --> 00:16:28.988 align:middle line:84%
nothing really frightening,
nothing life threatening.

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:34.127 align:middle line:84%
But my energy was low, my immune
system wasn't doing superbly,

00:16:34.127 --> 00:16:36.896 align:middle line:90%
my allergies were more active

00:16:36.896 --> 00:16:39.165 align:middle line:84%
than they had been
some years before.

00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:42.702 align:middle line:84%
And at the time my wife was
studying holistic nutrition

00:16:42.702 --> 00:16:44.804 align:middle line:90%
and herbal medicine and so on.

00:16:44.804 --> 00:16:50.243 align:middle line:84%
And one or two of the
instructors that she had talked

00:16:50.243 --> 00:16:54.747 align:middle line:84%
about the vegans that
they were seeing who had,

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:57.917 align:middle line:84%
not had been vegan for a
little while but had been vegan

00:16:57.917 --> 00:17:02.021 align:middle line:84%
for 20 years or so
and were coming

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:05.992 align:middle line:84%
in with some real depletions in
their bodies, some real lacks

00:17:05.992 --> 00:17:07.894 align:middle line:90%
of that particular nutrients.

00:17:07.894 --> 00:17:12.298 align:middle line:84%
And so she encouraged
this instructor

00:17:12.298 --> 00:17:16.402 align:middle line:84%
and particularly encouraged
her students including my wife

00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:19.973 align:middle line:84%
to think about these
things, whatever their diet.

00:17:19.973 --> 00:17:22.242 align:middle line:84%
And so my wife suggested
to me, you know,

00:17:22.242 --> 00:17:26.346 align:middle line:84%
maybe it will be worth
considering to making a shift.

00:17:26.346 --> 00:17:30.250 align:middle line:84%
We also at the time our doctor
was a Buddhist naturopath.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.186 align:middle line:84%
You know, not a supporter
of meeting potatoes diet--

00:17:33.186 --> 00:17:34.187 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:34.187 --> 00:17:35.121 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, standard
American diet

00:17:35.121 --> 00:17:36.222 align:middle line:84%
by any stretch of
the imagination.

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:39.492 align:middle line:84%
But she too looking
at my blood chemistry

00:17:39.492 --> 00:17:43.797 align:middle line:84%
and how my health was going
said, "You know, you might want

00:17:43.797 --> 00:17:46.199 align:middle line:84%
to think about doing something a
little different with your diet.

00:17:46.199 --> 00:17:47.233 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:50.403 align:middle line:84%
>> I think because
we had already gone

00:17:50.403 --> 00:17:53.139 align:middle line:90%
through that previous evolution

00:17:53.139 --> 00:17:56.042 align:middle line:84%
of recognizing the
interconnections,

00:17:56.042 --> 00:17:59.412 align:middle line:84%
recognizing that the life and
death of animals was connected

00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:06.619 align:middle line:84%
to our vegetables in a variety
of ways that helped us be ready

00:18:06.619 --> 00:18:08.755 align:middle line:84%
because our attitudes
had already softened

00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:11.891 align:middle line:90%
around the issues.

00:18:11.891 --> 00:18:15.461 align:middle line:84%
So we took that radical step of
having the first bowl of yogurt,

00:18:15.461 --> 00:18:17.463 align:middle line:84%
you know [laughter] which
is-- if you've been vegan.

00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:19.866 align:middle line:84%
>> If you've been vegan
that's a radical step.

00:18:19.866 --> 00:18:21.534 align:middle line:84%
>> You've been a vegan
for a decade, you know,

00:18:21.534 --> 00:18:25.572 align:middle line:84%
I've been vegan for about a
decade that feels strange.

00:18:25.572 --> 00:18:31.144 align:middle line:84%
And then when we also added in
a bit of wild fish and a bit

00:18:31.144 --> 00:18:33.379 align:middle line:84%
of local chicken, it was
a very strange experience.

00:18:33.379 --> 00:18:35.982 align:middle line:84%
The flavor, the texture,
the idea,

00:18:35.982 --> 00:18:41.454 align:middle line:84%
the philosophical emotional idea
of this was a living creature

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:46.059 align:middle line:84%
that I'm consuming
now was uncomfortable.

00:18:46.059 --> 00:18:48.194 align:middle line:90%
It was certainly strange.

00:18:48.194 --> 00:18:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>> When I went through
the same thing, it was--

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.098 align:middle line:90%
I was losing some strength.

00:18:52.098 --> 00:18:54.300 align:middle line:90%
I was having internal issues.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.103 align:middle line:84%
I mean my whole digestive
elimination tract seemed

00:18:57.103 --> 00:18:59.272 align:middle line:84%
like it was just kind
of shutting down.

00:18:59.272 --> 00:19:01.841 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't vital any longer
and I was having other signs

00:19:01.841 --> 00:19:03.943 align:middle line:84%
of protein depletion
which I was ignoring

00:19:03.943 --> 00:19:05.979 align:middle line:90%
for years as a matter of fact.

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:09.949 align:middle line:84%
And I finally went to a
doctor, British fellow

00:19:09.949 --> 00:19:11.584 align:middle line:90%
who was well known in the area.

00:19:11.584 --> 00:19:15.922 align:middle line:84%
He was an MD but he was
also highly intuitive.

00:19:15.922 --> 00:19:17.790 align:middle line:84%
So I meditated on
at that morning.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.259 align:middle line:84%
Before I went in, I
thought, "Oh my God.

00:19:19.259 --> 00:19:20.226 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?"

00:19:20.226 --> 00:19:21.561 align:middle line:90%
I need to do something.

00:19:21.561 --> 00:19:25.164 align:middle line:84%
And what I saw in the
meditation was a red steak,

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:28.935 align:middle line:84%
medium rare steak and a big
glass of red wine and I thought,

00:19:28.935 --> 00:19:31.771 align:middle line:90%
"No, no, I don't think so."

00:19:31.771 --> 00:19:34.407 align:middle line:84%
So I went in and I thought
he'll give me some other news

00:19:34.407 --> 00:19:35.441 align:middle line:90%
that I can really use.

00:19:35.441 --> 00:19:36.776 align:middle line:90%
This isn't an option.

00:19:36.776 --> 00:19:38.578 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Well I have to
tell you Regina [phonetic],

00:19:38.578 --> 00:19:41.547 align:middle line:84%
what I'm seeing is you
really need red meat."

00:19:41.547 --> 00:19:43.716 align:middle line:84%
And so after that
validation I thought,

00:19:43.716 --> 00:19:45.184 align:middle line:90%
"Okay, I'll take it on."

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:48.955 align:middle line:84%
And so at the time I had a
friend who was really good

00:19:48.955 --> 00:19:52.525 align:middle line:84%
at barbecuing, so we--
and my son was there.

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:55.028 align:middle line:84%
They knew this was
a very big deal.

00:19:55.028 --> 00:19:57.363 align:middle line:84%
No one was talking about it,
they're making small chat,

00:19:57.363 --> 00:20:00.400 align:middle line:84%
and finally, the
barbecue was done.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.102 align:middle line:84%
I ate all the vegetables on
the plate and this little piece

00:20:03.102 --> 00:20:05.438 align:middle line:84%
of steak was sitting there
in the middle of the plate

00:20:05.438 --> 00:20:06.806 align:middle line:90%
and I remember I started crying

00:20:06.806 --> 00:20:10.176 align:middle line:84%
and I just had salty tears
running down onto the plate.

00:20:10.176 --> 00:20:15.081 align:middle line:84%
And I took a bite, you know, it
was odd, it'd been many years,

00:20:15.081 --> 00:20:17.450 align:middle line:90%
it was odd, then I took another,

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.819 align:middle line:84%
and then I gabbled
the rest of up.

00:20:19.819 --> 00:20:24.824 align:middle line:84%
I had been going by Sizzler
billboard, the cheapest worst,

00:20:24.824 --> 00:20:26.292 align:middle line:84%
well, I shouldn't
say it but, you know,

00:20:26.292 --> 00:20:28.494 align:middle line:90%
not super high quality meat.

00:20:28.494 --> 00:20:32.732 align:middle line:84%
And I was practically salivating
driving by the sizzler billboard

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:36.669 align:middle line:84%
between Sedona and
[inaudible] something is off.

00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:38.972 align:middle line:84%
And when I ate it
I felt fabulous.

00:20:38.972 --> 00:20:40.073 align:middle line:90%
I felt fabulous.

00:20:40.073 --> 00:20:42.608 align:middle line:84%
It was no rejection
of it and everything.

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:44.110 align:middle line:84%
So I did it a couple
of times a week

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:48.214 align:middle line:84%
and my body started regaining
strength and recovering.

00:20:48.214 --> 00:20:52.919 align:middle line:84%
It was a very big deal
to do that, but it's--

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:54.687 align:middle line:84%
if you have to choose
a philosophy

00:20:54.687 --> 00:20:57.790 align:middle line:84%
or your physical health
and body and on life

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:00.460 align:middle line:90%
that becomes another dilemma.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.829 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. And I didn't
experience the--

00:21:02.829 --> 00:21:07.467 align:middle line:84%
that visceral craving of like
the billboard experience.

00:21:07.467 --> 00:21:11.437 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] But once I did
start eating, you know,

00:21:11.437 --> 00:21:16.743 align:middle line:84%
just like yogurt or some eggs,
you know, and then some chicken

00:21:16.743 --> 00:21:21.781 align:middle line:84%
and fish, my body also
seemed to welcome it.

00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:23.149 align:middle line:90%
My body felt just fine with it.

00:21:23.149 --> 00:21:24.917 align:middle line:84%
There was no, as
you say rejection.

00:21:24.917 --> 00:21:27.253 align:middle line:84%
There was never a
flavor I missed.

00:21:27.253 --> 00:21:30.656 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like I pined away for
10 years for the flavor of--

00:21:30.656 --> 00:21:32.225 align:middle line:90%
the flavor actually felt very--

00:21:32.225 --> 00:21:33.893 align:middle line:84%
tasted very strange
and the experience--

00:21:33.893 --> 00:21:35.027 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:35.027 --> 00:21:38.031 align:middle line:84%
>> -- are very strange,
but my body, you know,

00:21:38.031 --> 00:21:43.102 align:middle line:84%
my physical being seem quite
happy to have that back in diet,

00:21:43.102 --> 00:21:44.404 align:middle line:90%
even though it wasn't a major.

00:21:44.404 --> 00:21:46.205 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't returned into a
steak and potatoes family--

00:21:46.205 --> 00:21:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.007 align:middle line:90%
>> -- at all, but just having--

00:21:48.007 --> 00:21:49.108 align:middle line:84%
>> Just start adding
some of that.

00:21:49.108 --> 00:21:50.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of that, just
having some of that,

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:51.778 align:middle line:90%
my body was quite happy.

00:21:51.778 --> 00:21:53.045 align:middle line:84%
>> Now at this time
did you go back

00:21:53.045 --> 00:21:55.715 align:middle line:90%
to fishing for your own food?

00:21:55.715 --> 00:21:59.519 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, at that point, you
know, we were eating fish

00:21:59.519 --> 00:22:01.788 align:middle line:84%
and some local chicken
and I said, "Okay,

00:22:01.788 --> 00:22:03.756 align:middle line:90%
I want to be involved in this."

00:22:03.756 --> 00:22:07.660 align:middle line:84%
I want to-- just like
gardening I want to be involved,

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.962 align:middle line:84%
but unlike gardening
with the exception

00:22:09.962 --> 00:22:14.434 align:middle line:84%
of occasional woodchuck and, you
know, depredations by insects,

00:22:14.434 --> 00:22:18.704 align:middle line:84%
you know, fishing is about
killing and eating, you know,

00:22:18.704 --> 00:22:22.708 align:middle line:84%
flashes about killing for
the specific purpose not

00:22:22.708 --> 00:22:26.145 align:middle line:84%
as a side effect, not as
an unattended consequence

00:22:26.145 --> 00:22:30.082 align:middle line:84%
of agriculture but as an
intentional, this is food.

00:22:30.082 --> 00:22:32.752 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, I went back to fishing.

00:22:32.752 --> 00:22:36.923 align:middle line:84%
I reconnected with Willie, who
was my mentor when I was a kid

00:22:36.923 --> 00:22:41.594 align:middle line:84%
and he still have the fillet
knife that I had sent to him

00:22:41.594 --> 00:22:44.163 align:middle line:84%
when I went vegan, after few
years I sent him this fillet

00:22:44.163 --> 00:22:45.465 align:middle line:84%
knife and said, "I'm
done with this,"

00:22:45.465 --> 00:22:46.833 align:middle line:90%
but it has a good memories.

00:22:46.833 --> 00:22:50.436 align:middle line:84%
We used it together when I
was a kid and he held onto it.

00:22:50.436 --> 00:22:52.138 align:middle line:84%
And when I told him I was
thinking about fishing

00:22:52.138 --> 00:22:55.541 align:middle line:84%
and I have the scene in the
book where he says, you know,

00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:56.609 align:middle line:90%
"You want that knife back?"

00:22:56.609 --> 00:22:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was [inaudible]
type thing.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:59.612 align:middle line:84%
>> And he asked it like in his
bedside table, he like-- new.

00:22:59.612 --> 00:23:01.481 align:middle line:84%
He was-- he wouldn't throw
in some box somewhere.

00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:02.849 align:middle line:90%
>> He was waiting for you.

00:23:02.849 --> 00:23:05.885 align:middle line:84%
>> He was waiting for me to
return to the water in that way.

00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:13.392 align:middle line:84%
>> In this mix, you also started
examining the nature of forest

00:23:13.392 --> 00:23:18.331 align:middle line:84%
and forestry and logging,
a very big part of the web

00:23:18.331 --> 00:23:20.132 align:middle line:90%
of life on this planet.

00:23:20.132 --> 00:23:23.136 align:middle line:84%
Why did you do that and
what was your experience?

00:23:23.136 --> 00:23:27.106 align:middle line:84%
How long are you involve
and what did it teach you?

00:23:27.106 --> 00:23:32.278 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, my main reason was that
I wanted to know the landscape

00:23:32.278 --> 00:23:34.180 align:middle line:84%
that I lived in, the
forested landscape

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.748 align:middle line:84%
in Northern New England,
in Vermont.

00:23:35.748 --> 00:23:39.385 align:middle line:84%
I want to understand it better,
particularly in the sense

00:23:39.385 --> 00:23:43.089 align:middle line:84%
that we heat our house
with firewood primarily.

00:23:43.089 --> 00:23:45.992 align:middle line:84%
And I had worked as a
carpenter for a number of years

00:23:45.992 --> 00:23:48.661 align:middle line:90%
and had handled lumber.

00:23:48.661 --> 00:23:53.132 align:middle line:84%
And yet I had no connection
to where it came from

00:23:53.132 --> 00:23:55.801 align:middle line:84%
and I still have a real
discomfort with logging trucks,

00:23:55.801 --> 00:23:57.169 align:middle line:90%
rolling by and it was--

00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:59.805 align:middle line:84%
>> I know it looked like a truck
of bed full of dead bodies.

00:23:59.805 --> 00:24:02.842 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you know, the sound of
chain saw was in the distance,

00:24:02.842 --> 00:24:06.178 align:middle line:84%
you know, all those
things still bothered me,

00:24:06.178 --> 00:24:09.215 align:middle line:84%
and yet here I am constantly
using wood for a variety.

00:24:09.215 --> 00:24:10.149 align:middle line:90%
I live in a wooden house.

00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.917 align:middle line:90%
I heat it with wood.

00:24:10.917 --> 00:24:12.418 align:middle line:90%
I build with wood.

00:24:12.418 --> 00:24:14.587 align:middle line:84%
I use paper, all
of these things.

00:24:14.587 --> 00:24:18.157 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know, I
know it can be done badly.

00:24:18.157 --> 00:24:21.394 align:middle line:84%
I know there's logging that
is very rough on the land

00:24:21.394 --> 00:24:23.930 align:middle line:90%
and very rough on ecosystems.

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:27.500 align:middle line:84%
But I also believe
it can be done well.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.302 align:middle line:84%
I read I bit about
sustainable forestry

00:24:29.302 --> 00:24:31.204 align:middle line:90%
so how is that done, you know?

00:24:31.204 --> 00:24:36.275 align:middle line:84%
So, pinned this to a local guy
who was a forester and a logger,

00:24:36.275 --> 00:24:40.880 align:middle line:84%
so he had, you know, he knew
ecology and forest systems

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.915 align:middle line:84%
and he went out there
and implemented it

00:24:42.915 --> 00:24:46.319 align:middle line:84%
and run his own little
logging operation.

00:24:46.319 --> 00:24:49.055 align:middle line:84%
He was going to take me on
to work with him and learn

00:24:49.055 --> 00:24:51.257 align:middle line:90%
with him, and it was great.

00:24:51.257 --> 00:24:56.429 align:middle line:84%
It was a great experience
and the first time

00:24:56.429 --> 00:24:59.031 align:middle line:84%
of not just cutting
trees already down,

00:24:59.031 --> 00:25:01.067 align:middle line:84%
but cutting a living
tree, a big, you know.

00:25:01.067 --> 00:25:02.468 align:middle line:90%
>> How was that for you?

00:25:02.468 --> 00:25:07.139 align:middle line:84%
>> It was strange, you know, I
wanted to apologize to the tree.

00:25:07.139 --> 00:25:08.774 align:middle line:90%
>> I would feel that way, yes.

00:25:08.774 --> 00:25:10.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Before I felt it.

00:25:10.643 --> 00:25:11.777 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:11.777 --> 00:25:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>> 'Cause this is, you
know, a living being.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.082 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been around for
usually kind of long time.

00:25:16.082 --> 00:25:18.117 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is one, you know,
it's not a giant tree, but,

00:25:18.117 --> 00:25:20.353 align:middle line:84%
you know, maybe a 50
foot tall pine tree.

00:25:20.353 --> 00:25:24.890 align:middle line:84%
It's been around for,
you know, maybe 40 years.

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:31.831 align:middle line:84%
And I had to pause and really
kind of bite that moment.

00:25:32.932 --> 00:25:36.268 align:middle line:84%
Once I started doing
it, I started to realize

00:25:36.268 --> 00:25:41.941 align:middle line:84%
that I had always been pretty
comfortable with farm fields.

00:25:41.941 --> 00:25:47.413 align:middle line:84%
And I'm comfortable with
stumps in the woods.

00:25:47.413 --> 00:25:51.617 align:middle line:84%
I realized, one is tidier like
the farm field is kind of tidy

00:25:51.617 --> 00:25:54.220 align:middle line:84%
at least what I usually
see of it driving by,

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.188 align:middle line:90%
not all the nitty-gritty maybe

00:25:56.188 --> 00:26:00.760 align:middle line:84%
but the log forest
looks kind of messy.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:05.231 align:middle line:84%
But trees grow back in a
forest that's been gently

00:26:05.231 --> 00:26:07.733 align:middle line:84%
or well logged, you
know, maybe generate.

00:26:07.733 --> 00:26:10.236 align:middle line:84%
They never regenerate
in the farm field.

00:26:10.236 --> 00:26:10.903 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:26:10.903 --> 00:26:11.837 align:middle line:90%
>> That's ex-forest.

00:26:11.837 --> 00:26:12.605 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:12.605 --> 00:26:13.706 align:middle line:90%
>> And I start to realize

00:26:13.706 --> 00:26:15.941 align:middle line:84%
that there was a certain
aesthetic prejudice

00:26:15.941 --> 00:26:20.713 align:middle line:84%
that I had toward logging
or against logging.

00:26:20.713 --> 00:26:24.717 align:middle line:84%
And it became a very good
experience, you know,

00:26:24.717 --> 00:26:26.152 align:middle line:90%
to bring home fire wood.

00:26:26.152 --> 00:26:27.820 align:middle line:90%
I knew where it came from.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:32.525 align:middle line:84%
I knew what we had done
and how we had done it.

00:26:32.525 --> 00:26:37.963 align:middle line:84%
And for me all of this journey
has remain connected to some

00:26:37.963 --> 00:26:41.634 align:middle line:84%
of Thich Nhat Hanh's
teachings and mindfulness,

00:26:41.634 --> 00:26:44.303 align:middle line:84%
and particularly this
phrase interbeing

00:26:44.303 --> 00:26:46.906 align:middle line:84%
by which he means
understanding the complexities.

00:26:46.906 --> 00:26:51.811 align:middle line:84%
And he has this wonderful line,
paragraph in one of his books,

00:26:51.811 --> 00:26:54.380 align:middle line:84%
where he talks about
the book itself

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.549 align:middle line:84%
that you're reading
and the paper.

00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:59.385 align:middle line:84%
And he says, "There is
sunshine and there is land,

00:26:59.385 --> 00:27:03.022 align:middle line:84%
and there is rain in this
book, in this paper."

00:27:03.022 --> 00:27:05.758 align:middle line:84%
And he also says,
"And there's a logger,

00:27:05.758 --> 00:27:07.259 align:middle line:90%
and there's a mill somewhere."

00:27:07.259 --> 00:27:13.399 align:middle line:84%
So he acknowledges that maybe
darker side that sense that--

00:27:13.399 --> 00:27:14.233 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, the reality.

00:27:14.233 --> 00:27:15.101 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:15.101 --> 00:27:16.469 align:middle line:90%
>> The reality.

00:27:16.469 --> 00:27:20.005 align:middle line:84%
And collectively agreed upon
reality that this is acceptable

00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:22.808 align:middle line:90%
to promote this, so to speak.

00:27:22.808 --> 00:27:25.878 align:middle line:84%
And really-- and again,
everything you're talking

00:27:25.878 --> 00:27:28.047 align:middle line:84%
about has the same thing in
mind which is in the title

00:27:28.047 --> 00:27:30.683 align:middle line:84%
of your book which is being
mindful of each of these things.

00:27:30.683 --> 00:27:34.019 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean we necessarily
need to make a different choice,

00:27:34.019 --> 00:27:36.188 align:middle line:84%
but we have to be mindful
of the consequences

00:27:36.188 --> 00:27:39.358 align:middle line:84%
in what we are choosing, and
the whole subject of forestry

00:27:39.358 --> 00:27:41.527 align:middle line:90%
which I too find fascinating

00:27:41.527 --> 00:27:45.498 align:middle line:84%
and the exploitation
that has occurred.

00:27:45.498 --> 00:27:47.032 align:middle line:84%
That's something
that I think each

00:27:47.032 --> 00:27:48.534 align:middle line:90%
of us need to be mindful of now.

00:27:48.534 --> 00:27:51.337 align:middle line:84%
Even when you talk to
forestry, I did a documentary

00:27:51.337 --> 00:27:55.474 align:middle line:84%
on the forest one time, and I
remember sitting with someone

00:27:55.474 --> 00:27:57.743 align:middle line:84%
from the forest department,
the California Department

00:27:57.743 --> 00:28:01.046 align:middle line:84%
of Forestry, and saying,
"But look around here,

00:28:01.046 --> 00:28:03.549 align:middle line:90%
you don't have the debris

00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:06.886 align:middle line:84%
that is a real firehouse
tagged for removal.

00:28:06.886 --> 00:28:13.058 align:middle line:84%
You have this beautiful sugar
pine, large, you know, very old,

00:28:13.058 --> 00:28:16.162 align:middle line:84%
sugar pine tag to be
logged, what's up with that?

00:28:16.162 --> 00:28:17.963 align:middle line:84%
She was very uncomfortable
in answering,

00:28:17.963 --> 00:28:21.667 align:middle line:84%
but she said, "We
need the money."

00:28:21.667 --> 00:28:26.539 align:middle line:84%
So it was-- she was a very I
think vulnerable moment for her

00:28:26.539 --> 00:28:29.842 align:middle line:84%
on a career level and one of
the most honest I had heard

00:28:29.842 --> 00:28:34.480 align:middle line:84%
from any official participant
in the logging industry.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.683 align:middle line:84%
The fact was to maintain
another portion of the forest,

00:28:37.683 --> 00:28:41.287 align:middle line:84%
they needed money, and so they
were coaling the beautiful trees

00:28:41.287 --> 00:28:42.955 align:middle line:84%
that should not have
been coaled.

00:28:42.955 --> 00:28:45.991 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is the
opposite of what you're talking

00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:48.861 align:middle line:84%
about in the kind of forestry
that you were involved with.

00:28:48.861 --> 00:28:51.597 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. I mean we
were primarily thinning

00:28:51.597 --> 00:28:56.402 align:middle line:84%
to promote forest health and
healthy bigger trees that later,

00:28:56.402 --> 00:28:58.437 align:middle line:90%
more mature wood get logged.

00:28:58.437 --> 00:28:59.572 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:59.572 --> 00:29:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And would be replaced
by other as [inaudible].

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.109 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean they're starting in
a serious decline end, yeah

00:29:04.109 --> 00:29:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>> So we learned a lot together.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.281 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:29:09.281 --> 00:29:10.883 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, and I enjoyed
the process of learning

00:29:10.883 --> 00:29:12.151 align:middle line:90%
about the woods in that way.

00:29:12.151 --> 00:29:13.552 align:middle line:90%
>> And it is interesting too,

00:29:13.552 --> 00:29:16.789 align:middle line:84%
many years ago I had the
experience of hearing

00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:19.625 align:middle line:84%
from someone I have a great deal
of respect for about the nature

00:29:19.625 --> 00:29:22.061 align:middle line:84%
of forest and the
intelligence of forest and doing

00:29:22.061 --> 00:29:25.764 align:middle line:84%
at the way you're talking about
is so much more appropriate or--

00:29:25.764 --> 00:29:30.502 align:middle line:84%
and even more so just a natural
forest that takes care of itself

00:29:30.502 --> 00:29:33.005 align:middle line:84%
through fire and so forth which
you can't like range anymore

00:29:33.005 --> 00:29:34.273 align:middle line:84%
because with houses
built in them.

00:29:34.273 --> 00:29:35.274 align:middle line:90%
>> True.

00:29:35.274 --> 00:29:36.542 align:middle line:84%
>> But it was talking
about the fact

00:29:36.542 --> 00:29:40.846 align:middle line:84%
that forest have intelligence
as families, as clans,

00:29:40.846 --> 00:29:44.550 align:middle line:84%
that the information and
knowledge of the process

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:46.986 align:middle line:84%
of living and growth and
regeneration is passed

00:29:46.986 --> 00:29:49.488 align:middle line:84%
on from one generation
to another.

00:29:49.488 --> 00:29:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And we don't tend to think
of static objects as living

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.796 align:middle line:84%
with a large degree of
consciousness and connectedness,

00:29:57.796 --> 00:29:59.298 align:middle line:90%
but that's our mistake.

00:29:59.298 --> 00:30:03.068 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, there are many cultures
that have an understanding

00:30:03.068 --> 00:30:08.274 align:middle line:84%
of plants including trees as
being fairly high, you know,

00:30:08.274 --> 00:30:10.075 align:middle line:84%
fairly highly evolved
creatures and beings.

00:30:10.075 --> 00:30:11.043 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:11.043 --> 00:30:13.078 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, perhaps
smarter than us.

00:30:13.078 --> 00:30:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>> In many ways.

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.781 align:middle line:84%
>> That there's-- there are
African traditions I read

00:30:15.781 --> 00:30:18.951 align:middle line:84%
where they say, you
know, they don't need

00:30:18.951 --> 00:30:20.719 align:middle line:90%
to make noise to communicate.

00:30:20.719 --> 00:30:21.687 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:21.687 --> 00:30:22.788 align:middle line:84%
>> And then animals
they make noise,

00:30:22.788 --> 00:30:24.189 align:middle line:90%
they don't need the language.

00:30:24.189 --> 00:30:26.091 align:middle line:84%
And we're kind of lame,
because we need lame.

00:30:26.091 --> 00:30:29.295 align:middle line:84%
>> We need a lot of noise
and language to communicate.

00:30:29.295 --> 00:30:31.196 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was kind of
interesting the reversal

00:30:31.196 --> 00:30:33.799 align:middle line:90%
of our typical thinking.

00:30:33.799 --> 00:30:36.435 align:middle line:84%
>> Another area you went
into and this is leading

00:30:36.435 --> 00:30:40.372 align:middle line:84%
up to the fact that you
ultimately ended up in the world

00:30:40.372 --> 00:30:44.143 align:middle line:84%
of hunting which was a
giant leap forward for you.

00:30:44.143 --> 00:30:46.312 align:middle line:84%
But you were asking
some questions and one

00:30:46.312 --> 00:30:48.113 align:middle line:90%
of them was how do we reconcile

00:30:48.113 --> 00:30:52.551 align:middle line:84%
that animals naturally
kill other animals.

00:30:52.551 --> 00:30:56.188 align:middle line:84%
And we separate ourselves
out as something different

00:30:56.188 --> 00:30:59.024 align:middle line:90%
that we are part animal.

00:30:59.024 --> 00:31:02.161 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about that debate
you went through in your mind

00:31:02.161 --> 00:31:03.896 align:middle line:90%
and your views of that.

00:31:03.896 --> 00:31:08.934 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah. One of the arguments
that often made for hunting,

00:31:08.934 --> 00:31:10.936 align:middle line:84%
you know, in defense
of hunting is

00:31:10.936 --> 00:31:13.806 align:middle line:84%
that well animals
prey on each other.

00:31:13.806 --> 00:31:14.907 align:middle line:90%
It's natural.

00:31:14.907 --> 00:31:17.876 align:middle line:84%
Predation is natural
and absolutely it is.

00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:24.616 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we have made
some real mistakes in thinking

00:31:24.616 --> 00:31:28.454 align:middle line:84%
about human life as
being a certain length

00:31:28.454 --> 00:31:30.856 align:middle line:84%
and a certain way
of dying as natural.

00:31:30.856 --> 00:31:33.826 align:middle line:84%
So like natural causes
and natural life span.

00:31:33.826 --> 00:31:36.228 align:middle line:84%
So we think, okay, I'm
going to live to be 70, 80,

00:31:36.228 --> 00:31:38.530 align:middle line:90%
90, that's what I expect.

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:42.835 align:middle line:84%
And if I die in this way
that's natural causes.

00:31:42.835 --> 00:31:45.604 align:middle line:84%
But if I get taken down
by a mountain lion,

00:31:45.604 --> 00:31:48.040 align:middle line:84%
that's not natural causes,
that's something else.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.274 align:middle line:90%
We're not part of that system

00:31:49.274 --> 00:31:52.745 align:middle line:84%
and we think ourselves
as food, as prey.

00:31:52.745 --> 00:31:57.116 align:middle line:84%
But when we think about the
animal world and predation

00:31:57.116 --> 00:32:04.156 align:middle line:84%
of the animal world, we often
project that I think and say,

00:32:04.156 --> 00:32:10.162 align:middle line:84%
predation we know it's natural,
but it cut short a life.

00:32:10.162 --> 00:32:15.534 align:middle line:84%
It cuts bird that could
technically live to 5

00:32:15.534 --> 00:32:21.173 align:middle line:84%
or 8 years, only lives
to 6 weeks or a year.

00:32:21.173 --> 00:32:28.647 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a mistake for
us to make that kind of leap

00:32:28.647 --> 00:32:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and project our moral notions
onto the natural world.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:38.357 align:middle line:84%
But I also think it's a mistake
in that defense of hunting

00:32:38.357 --> 00:32:42.528 align:middle line:84%
to say, well animals do
it, why shouldn't we do it.

00:32:42.528 --> 00:32:49.234 align:middle line:84%
Because, yes we're animal of
course, but we also have a moral

00:32:49.234 --> 00:32:52.638 align:middle line:84%
and compassionate, you
know, a moral logic

00:32:52.638 --> 00:32:59.545 align:middle line:84%
and ideally a compassionate
heart which is allows us

00:32:59.545 --> 00:33:01.346 align:middle line:90%
to make choices about that.

00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And so, I wrestled
with the recognition

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.956 align:middle line:84%
of just how much life
and death is going

00:33:10.956 --> 00:33:12.491 align:middle line:90%
on all the time around me.

00:33:12.491 --> 00:33:15.094 align:middle line:84%
It's something that I
didn't see very often,

00:33:15.094 --> 00:33:19.164 align:middle line:84%
but when I saw it reminded me,
"Oh, yeah, this is constant.

00:33:19.164 --> 00:33:23.335 align:middle line:84%
This is how most
creatures live and die."

00:33:23.335 --> 00:33:27.806 align:middle line:84%
Predation is perhaps the
most natural way to go

00:33:27.806 --> 00:33:33.512 align:middle line:84%
for most species--
carnivores ,predators,

00:33:33.512 --> 00:33:35.948 align:middle line:84%
even though there's a lot
of gray area, you know,

00:33:35.948 --> 00:33:37.216 align:middle line:84%
chicken will attack
and eat mouse.

00:33:37.216 --> 00:33:38.550 align:middle line:90%
So, you know--

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:40.285 align:middle line:84%
>> Chicken hawks
will eat the chicken.

00:33:40.285 --> 00:33:40.919 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:33:40.919 --> 00:33:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>> And on and on.

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.289 align:middle line:84%
>> There are some
large carnivores

00:33:44.289 --> 00:33:49.661 align:middle line:84%
that are never really prey,
but they're relatively few,

00:33:49.661 --> 00:33:52.931 align:middle line:84%
you know, and they
eventually get eaten too.

00:33:52.931 --> 00:33:55.167 align:middle line:84%
They decompose and
smaller creatures eat them,

00:33:55.167 --> 00:33:57.136 align:middle line:84%
they get them, make it
scavenge and actually gets

00:33:57.136 --> 00:34:00.806 align:middle line:84%
down to the microbes,
you know, we're all food.

00:34:00.806 --> 00:34:03.475 align:middle line:84%
And the philosopher Val
Plumwood who I mentioned

00:34:03.475 --> 00:34:06.378 align:middle line:84%
in this wonderful message,
she wrote about the experience

00:34:06.378 --> 00:34:10.082 align:middle line:84%
of being attack by a crocodile
which I mentioned in the book.

00:34:10.082 --> 00:34:17.289 align:middle line:84%
She talks about both the
shock of being reduced to prey

00:34:17.289 --> 00:34:20.092 align:middle line:90%
and narrowly surviving it.

00:34:20.092 --> 00:34:24.129 align:middle line:84%
She also talks about the
western culture illusion

00:34:24.129 --> 00:34:26.932 align:middle line:84%
that we aren't part
of the food system,

00:34:26.932 --> 00:34:31.436 align:middle line:84%
that we aren't positioned
in this web of food.

00:34:31.436 --> 00:34:37.575 align:middle line:84%
So I over time started to become
more comfortable with that.

00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:41.313 align:middle line:84%
Both myself as a potential
predators as I begin to think

00:34:41.313 --> 00:34:46.118 align:middle line:84%
about the possibility of
hunting and myself as,

00:34:46.118 --> 00:34:47.718 align:middle line:90%
you know, part of the system.

00:34:47.718 --> 00:34:50.956 align:middle line:84%
And I get buried in
the pine box, you know.

00:34:50.956 --> 00:34:54.293 align:middle line:84%
I'll be part of that tree
and maybe part of that trout

00:34:54.293 --> 00:34:56.728 align:middle line:84%
and maybe part of
that deer someday.

00:34:56.728 --> 00:34:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Right. It sounds to me,

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:01.466 align:middle line:84%
I mean really what you've done
is you were taking the hypocrisy

00:35:01.466 --> 00:35:02.901 align:middle line:90%
out of your life experience.

00:35:02.901 --> 00:35:04.603 align:middle line:84%
I mean there is a lot of
hypocrisy, and you say,

00:35:04.603 --> 00:35:07.673 align:middle line:84%
"Oh I'm so against killing," and
then you go to the grocery store

00:35:07.673 --> 00:35:13.078 align:middle line:84%
and buy a neatly plastic wrapped
pound of sirloin or a trout

00:35:13.078 --> 00:35:16.949 align:middle line:84%
or whatever and you were
essentially saying I'm not going

00:35:16.949 --> 00:35:18.283 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:35:18.283 --> 00:35:19.618 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to play that game.

00:35:19.618 --> 00:35:21.486 align:middle line:84%
If I'm going to do it I'm
going to look at in the eye

00:35:21.486 --> 00:35:24.890 align:middle line:84%
and take full responsibility
for what I'm doing.

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:29.494 align:middle line:84%
Now, the other part of
this debate comes down to--

00:35:29.494 --> 00:35:33.198 align:middle line:84%
yes, if you need to hunt and
this is part of your sustenance

00:35:33.198 --> 00:35:37.502 align:middle line:84%
and as you said when you
became a vegan, you didn't need

00:35:37.502 --> 00:35:39.371 align:middle line:90%
to eat that fish that day.

00:35:39.371 --> 00:35:44.042 align:middle line:84%
Now, how did you bridge
that gap into hunting

00:35:44.042 --> 00:35:50.015 align:middle line:84%
which is I don't need
to, but I'm going to?

00:35:50.015 --> 00:35:53.018 align:middle line:84%
What was that debate
in your mind?

00:35:53.018 --> 00:35:55.454 align:middle line:84%
>> There were a couple of
things that drew me to hunting.

00:35:55.454 --> 00:35:57.623 align:middle line:84%
One was that ethical
confrontation,

00:35:57.623 --> 00:36:00.225 align:middle line:90%
that taking responsibility.

00:36:01.793 --> 00:36:07.666 align:middle line:84%
Another was hunting as a
different way of like forestry,

00:36:07.666 --> 00:36:09.501 align:middle line:90%
a different way of interacting

00:36:09.501 --> 00:36:11.403 align:middle line:84%
with the landscape
that I live in.

00:36:11.403 --> 00:36:15.173 align:middle line:84%
I'm part of this
natural community here.

00:36:15.173 --> 00:36:21.613 align:middle line:84%
And when I started to hunt and
pay attention to animal sign,

00:36:21.613 --> 00:36:23.949 align:middle line:84%
I learned things that I
didn't learn as a hiker

00:36:23.949 --> 00:36:25.083 align:middle line:90%
or as a bird watcher

00:36:25.083 --> 00:36:27.986 align:middle line:84%
as a canoeist you know,
the things like this.

00:36:27.986 --> 00:36:31.556 align:middle line:84%
But that's central debate,
that central question

00:36:31.556 --> 00:36:34.793 align:middle line:90%
of I don't need to hunt.

00:36:34.793 --> 00:36:39.231 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to take of that
particular animal's life.

00:36:39.231 --> 00:36:42.067 align:middle line:90%
I can let that animal walk away.

00:36:42.067 --> 00:36:49.341 align:middle line:84%
That remained and it didn't
just get resolved for me,

00:36:49.341 --> 00:36:56.782 align:middle line:84%
because that question is
one, I think that all hunters

00:36:56.782 --> 00:36:59.484 align:middle line:90%
to some extent live with.

00:36:59.484 --> 00:37:04.456 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard many stories
from hunter who have seen animal

00:37:04.456 --> 00:37:07.225 align:middle line:84%
that is legal to take
and perhaps the kind

00:37:07.225 --> 00:37:12.864 align:middle line:84%
of animal very specifically they
went out to take the life of,

00:37:12.864 --> 00:37:14.733 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes it just
doesn't feel right

00:37:14.733 --> 00:37:17.336 align:middle line:90%
and that you choose not to.

00:37:17.336 --> 00:37:19.504 align:middle line:84%
You know, that moment
is not right.

00:37:19.504 --> 00:37:21.273 align:middle line:90%
What the reasons are?

00:37:21.273 --> 00:37:25.344 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they can't even explain,
but for whatever reason.

00:37:25.344 --> 00:37:30.182 align:middle line:84%
So I remained ambivalent
as I stepped into the woods

00:37:30.182 --> 00:37:34.086 align:middle line:84%
for the first time and then
the second time, the third time

00:37:34.086 --> 00:37:37.089 align:middle line:84%
and it took quite a while before
I even had to really face it,

00:37:37.089 --> 00:37:38.790 align:middle line:84%
because hunting is
actually quite difficult.

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:39.424 align:middle line:90%
>> You're right.

00:37:39.424 --> 00:37:39.958 align:middle line:90%
>> In many cases.

00:37:39.958 --> 00:37:41.093 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:37:41.093 --> 00:37:44.429 align:middle line:84%
>> But it was one I was
constantly living with.

00:37:44.429 --> 00:37:46.832 align:middle line:90%
Would I kill?

00:37:46.832 --> 00:37:50.135 align:middle line:90%
And if so, how would that feel

00:37:50.135 --> 00:37:54.473 align:middle line:84%
and what would that
choice be like?

00:37:54.473 --> 00:37:56.408 align:middle line:90%
>> That is that I can--

00:37:56.408 --> 00:37:59.344 align:middle line:84%
I can only imagine how
difficult it is not having been

00:37:59.344 --> 00:38:01.313 align:middle line:84%
in that position, not that
many women don't hunt.

00:38:01.313 --> 00:38:03.048 align:middle line:90%
There are women who do hunt.

00:38:03.048 --> 00:38:06.852 align:middle line:84%
But this was something that was
really driven home in a movie

00:38:06.852 --> 00:38:08.687 align:middle line:90%
which I adore this movie.

00:38:08.687 --> 00:38:15.394 align:middle line:84%
1995, the movie Powder, about
unusual young man who lived

00:38:15.394 --> 00:38:19.364 align:middle line:84%
in a community that was based
on living close to the land

00:38:19.364 --> 00:38:22.768 align:middle line:84%
and hunting, and we're going
to show a little clip of it.

00:38:22.768 --> 00:38:26.338 align:middle line:84%
This is what happened when
one of his family friends,

00:38:26.338 --> 00:38:29.975 align:middle line:84%
one of the older men went out
hunting and the boy was able

00:38:29.975 --> 00:38:35.414 align:middle line:84%
to bridge the intelligence's
information between the deer

00:38:35.414 --> 00:38:38.350 align:middle line:90%
and the man who had hunted him.

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:39.618 align:middle line:90%

that particular one that's very

And the thing that
he was pointing out,

00:40:59.457 --> 00:41:01.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean he transferred all
the feelings of the animal

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.696 align:middle line:84%
into the man and
then of course he--

00:41:04.696 --> 00:41:07.265 align:middle line:84%
after he felt, he would be quit
hunting, but the reality is

00:41:07.265 --> 00:41:12.704 align:middle line:84%
that animal is maimed and
there is very big part of this

00:41:12.704 --> 00:41:16.741 align:middle line:84%
that requires not just, you
know, the social responsibility

00:41:16.741 --> 00:41:19.277 align:middle line:84%
that you're talking about,
environmental responsibility,

00:41:19.277 --> 00:41:22.347 align:middle line:84%
but also the skill to
be able to do this well.

a scene like this.

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:27.419 align:middle line:84%
>> And so let's talk about
that, how did that go for you

00:41:27.419 --> 00:41:31.022 align:middle line:84%
and the whole motion of maiming
versus killing and what happens

00:41:31.022 --> 00:41:35.493 align:middle line:84%
when you go to kill but you end
up accidentally maiming maybe

00:41:35.493 --> 00:41:38.697 align:middle line:84%
because of a lack of
skill or what not.

00:41:38.697 --> 00:41:41.333 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, a couple
thoughts come to mind,

00:41:41.333 --> 00:41:45.470 align:middle line:84%
one is that many cultures
and actually including sort

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:52.143 align:middle line:84%
of European hunter traditions
have stories and rituals

00:41:52.143 --> 00:41:55.046 align:middle line:84%
in which the hunter and
the hunted reverse roles

00:41:55.046 --> 00:41:57.349 align:middle line:84%
and the hunter becomes
the hunted.

00:41:57.349 --> 00:42:01.052 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that that
there's a lot of wisdom in that,

00:42:01.052 --> 00:42:04.556 align:middle line:84%
it's not unlike the scene in
some ways, deeply imbedded

00:42:04.556 --> 00:42:08.026 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of hunting
cultures traditions.

00:42:09.127 --> 00:42:17.002 align:middle line:84%
And for me the fear
of maiming an animal,

00:42:17.002 --> 00:42:19.604 align:middle line:84%
the fear of not having
an instant

00:42:19.604 --> 00:42:24.442 align:middle line:84%
or nearly instant
kill was a deep one

00:42:24.442 --> 00:42:29.848 align:middle line:84%
and I've interviewed a lot
of hunters who particularly

00:42:29.848 --> 00:42:32.584 align:middle line:84%
who came to hunting as adults,
I did some graduate research

00:42:32.584 --> 00:42:37.589 align:middle line:84%
on this, and it's a
very common deep fear.

00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:41.059 align:middle line:84%
That is the last thing that
people want to experience.

00:42:41.059 --> 00:42:43.561 align:middle line:84%
And frankly it's true for a
lot of lifelong hunters too.

You know, my uncle has
been hunting since he was

00:42:45.597 --> 00:42:52.003 align:middle line:84%
in his teens and he has had the
experience of wounding an animal

00:42:52.003 --> 00:42:54.873 align:middle line:84%
and not finding it, and not
knowing whether it survived

00:42:54.873 --> 00:42:56.307 align:middle line:90%
or not.

Despite being a very
disciplined, very skilled hunter

00:43:00.979 --> 00:43:06.017 align:middle line:84%
and he has come close in his
mind to not doing it again

00:43:06.017 --> 00:43:11.256 align:middle line:84%
because it such a painful
emotional experience to-- -

00:43:11.256 --> 00:43:13.158 align:middle line:84%
>> I would think you'd
take that home with you.

00:43:13.158 --> 00:43:14.492 align:middle line:90%
>> Very much so.

00:43:14.492 --> 00:43:16.861 align:middle line:84%
And any hunter I've
talked to who has had

00:43:16.861 --> 00:43:24.536 align:middle line:84%
that experience has expressed
a lot of regret and some doubts

00:43:24.536 --> 00:43:27.372 align:middle line:84%
about what they would
do next time.

00:43:27.372 --> 00:43:28.373 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:43:28.373 --> 00:43:29.307 align:middle line:84%
>> And certainly
perhaps about the choice

00:43:29.307 --> 00:43:30.675 align:middle line:90%
that they made in that moment.

00:43:30.675 --> 00:43:36.881 align:middle line:84%
So, for me learning marksmanship
and being disciplined

00:43:36.881 --> 00:43:39.384 align:middle line:84%
about the choices that I
made in terms of the shots

00:43:39.384 --> 00:43:43.455 align:middle line:84%
that I'd be willing to
take was quite important.

00:43:43.455 --> 00:43:48.426 align:middle line:84%
I also had a very humbling
experience when I was

00:43:48.426 --> 00:43:50.895 align:middle line:84%
out there I think in
my second or third--

00:43:50.895 --> 00:43:54.466 align:middle line:84%
my second season
of hunting deer.

00:43:54.466 --> 00:43:57.635 align:middle line:84%
When I took a shot
and completely missed

00:43:57.635 --> 00:44:00.505 align:middle line:84%
as with the bow and
I mostly it's hunting

00:44:00.505 --> 00:44:02.741 align:middle line:84%
with a firearm 'cause for me
I feel much more confident

00:44:02.741 --> 00:44:06.111 align:middle line:84%
to be able to make that
quick instant kill,

00:44:06.111 --> 00:44:08.046 align:middle line:84%
but at that time I
was hunting with a bow

00:44:08.046 --> 00:44:10.949 align:middle line:90%
and I completely missed.

00:44:10.949 --> 00:44:16.287 align:middle line:84%
What came over me was a
deep shame that I have made

00:44:16.287 --> 00:44:18.623 align:middle line:84%
such a bad choice
because that could

00:44:18.623 --> 00:44:20.158 align:middle line:90%
so easily have been a wound,

00:44:20.158 --> 00:44:24.963 align:middle line:84%
if I had that little
control over, over that shot.

00:44:24.963 --> 00:44:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And even though the range
was good and I had practiced

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:33.171 align:middle line:84%
and all that, it was-- the
conditions were such that I--

00:44:33.171 --> 00:44:35.740 align:middle line:84%
that I made, you
know, quite a missed.

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:41.479 align:middle line:84%
And that already
enforced my commitment

00:44:41.479 --> 00:44:43.214 align:middle line:90%
to making better choices.

00:44:43.214 --> 00:44:45.617 align:middle line:84%
And then I went-- made
another mistake just like it.

00:44:45.617 --> 00:44:47.218 align:middle line:84%
[laughs] It was, you know,
deeply humbling to realize

00:44:47.218 --> 00:44:49.754 align:middle line:84%
that whatever your
marksmanship skills

00:44:49.754 --> 00:44:53.024 align:middle line:84%
and whatever your
good intentions

00:44:53.024 --> 00:44:57.662 align:middle line:84%
and whatever your ethics, you
can still have bad judgment

00:44:57.662 --> 00:45:00.965 align:middle line:84%
and make a poor choice
in the moment.

00:45:00.965 --> 00:45:03.868 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
something we all hunters lived

00:45:03.868 --> 00:45:06.438 align:middle line:90%
with as a potential.

00:45:06.438 --> 00:45:08.907 align:middle line:84%
The better they get, the
better their discipline

00:45:08.907 --> 00:45:13.778 align:middle line:84%
and the better their,
you know, their judgment,

00:45:13.778 --> 00:45:17.682 align:middle line:84%
the less likely I think
that is to happen.

00:45:17.682 --> 00:45:18.883 align:middle line:90%
And thankfully for me it has--

00:45:18.883 --> 00:45:22.987 align:middle line:84%
I've never actually
wounded an animal and the--

00:45:22.987 --> 00:45:26.157 align:middle line:84%
but the fear of doing
it remains with me.

00:45:26.157 --> 00:45:30.261 align:middle line:84%
>> What about-- I know that
in your book you stated that,

00:45:30.261 --> 00:45:33.865 align:middle line:84%
"It's not as though
there's a joy in killing."

00:45:33.865 --> 00:45:38.136 align:middle line:84%
But for some of the hunters
there is a joy in killing.

00:45:38.136 --> 00:45:41.773 align:middle line:84%
This is a different
mindset, you know?

00:45:41.773 --> 00:45:42.907 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:45:42.907 --> 00:45:46.177 align:middle line:84%
>> To go out and there's
an actual joy or thrill

00:45:46.177 --> 00:45:49.013 align:middle line:84%
that takes place in
having taken another life.

00:45:49.013 --> 00:45:53.184 align:middle line:84%
And I would think it's a fine
line between being grateful

00:45:53.184 --> 00:45:57.388 align:middle line:84%
that you did it well
and having that thrill

00:45:57.388 --> 00:45:59.157 align:middle line:90%
of taking another life.

00:45:59.157 --> 00:46:00.692 align:middle line:90%
How is that defined to you

00:46:00.692 --> 00:46:03.995 align:middle line:84%
and among the people
that you see as well?

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:12.437 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a difficult and
tricky terrain to navigate.

00:46:12.437 --> 00:46:17.709 align:middle line:84%
Are there people out there
who genuinely enjoy doing harm

00:46:17.709 --> 00:46:20.545 align:middle line:84%
and inflicting pain
and inflicting death?

00:46:20.545 --> 00:46:25.750 align:middle line:84%
Sure. Some of them are hunters;
some of them are not hunters,

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:29.821 align:middle line:84%
whether those people are
more common among hunters

00:46:29.821 --> 00:46:32.257 align:middle line:84%
than among the general
population,

00:46:32.257 --> 00:46:35.159 align:middle line:90%
I don't know, I'm not sure.

00:46:36.361 --> 00:46:39.130 align:middle line:90%

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:41.933 align:middle line:84%

sadism essentially exist

whether it's afflicted on humans

00:46:44.435 --> 00:46:46.604 align:middle line:90%
or animals, or whatever.

00:46:48.072 --> 00:46:51.876 align:middle line:84%

lot of gray area and a lot

00:46:51.876 --> 00:46:57.649 align:middle line:84%
of misinterpretation
of the joy in the hunt.

00:46:57.649 --> 00:47:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And I have essay coming
out later this year about--

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:06.591 align:middle line:84%
I call it, "Killing and
Grinning and smiling,

00:47:06.591 --> 00:47:08.059 align:middle line:90%
the ethics of emotion."

00:47:08.059 --> 00:47:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we see a
picture of a hunter

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:14.432 align:middle line:90%
with a dead animal who's--

00:47:14.432 --> 00:47:18.436 align:middle line:84%
and the hunter is
smiling into the camera.

00:47:18.436 --> 00:47:23.207 align:middle line:84%
That symbol, that image
evokes very different sorts

00:47:23.207 --> 00:47:28.513 align:middle line:84%
of responses in us depending
on our feelings about hunting

00:47:28.513 --> 00:47:31.282 align:middle line:84%
and our experiences,
and a lot of this,

00:47:31.282 --> 00:47:33.284 align:middle line:90%

00:47:33.284 --> 00:47:34.419 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:47:34.419 --> 00:47:40.625 align:middle line:84%
Is it pride in having
accomplished something,

00:47:40.625 --> 00:47:45.863 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps a still-- a charge
of energy from the hunt,

00:47:45.863 --> 00:47:49.300 align:middle line:84%
you know, that, you
know, it's intense.

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:52.870 align:middle line:84%
There's energy in it and that
can come out in the smile.

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:55.773 align:middle line:84%
And there can be joy in having
done something well especially

00:47:55.773 --> 00:47:57.508 align:middle line:90%
who is difficult.

00:47:57.508 --> 00:48:00.144 align:middle line:84%
That's very different
interpretation

00:48:00.144 --> 00:48:03.681 align:middle line:84%
from the way I used to
interpret those pictures

00:48:03.681 --> 00:48:07.952 align:middle line:84%
which is this is sadism,
this is joy in death,

00:48:07.952 --> 00:48:10.822 align:middle line:84%
this is joy in the act of
killing in that precise act not

00:48:10.822 --> 00:48:13.458 align:middle line:90%
in the whole process of the hunt

00:48:13.458 --> 00:48:16.594 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps some
pride and success.

00:48:16.594 --> 00:48:24.035 align:middle line:84%
So, I find myself needing
to not judge too quickly

00:48:24.035 --> 00:48:25.870 align:middle line:90%
and to really try to understand.

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:28.539 align:middle line:84%
You know, there are people
I don't want to hunt with,

00:48:28.539 --> 00:48:31.476 align:middle line:84%
there are plenty of people that
I'd be happy to hang out with,

00:48:31.476 --> 00:48:34.645 align:middle line:84%
but I would not hunt with just
through the emotion, attitude,

00:48:34.645 --> 00:48:36.781 align:middle line:84%
ethics, philosophy,
it doesn't match mine

00:48:36.781 --> 00:48:40.218 align:middle line:84%
so I won't hunt with
that person.

00:48:40.218 --> 00:48:43.955 align:middle line:84%
But I also want to remain
open to the possibility

00:48:43.955 --> 00:48:50.762 align:middle line:84%
that their attitude or their
emotion doesn't carry necessary

00:48:50.762 --> 00:48:54.399 align:middle line:84%
the negative moral conditions
that I might suspect.

00:48:54.399 --> 00:48:56.701 align:middle line:84%
So, there's-- it's tricky--
a tricky [inaudible].

00:48:56.701 --> 00:49:00.471 align:middle line:84%
>> It has been and thank you for
explaining your feelings on that

00:49:00.471 --> 00:49:03.875 align:middle line:84%
and how you've gone through
that that transformation

00:49:03.875 --> 00:49:06.911 align:middle line:84%
of viewing it from
way into another.

00:49:06.911 --> 00:49:10.048 align:middle line:84%
And it-- you bring up
another really big point

00:49:10.048 --> 00:49:14.118 align:middle line:84%
and that is we are part
animals, we are competitive

00:49:14.118 --> 00:49:15.820 align:middle line:84%
with each other, you
can get into a lot

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:19.524 align:middle line:84%
of different philosophical
debates on why that is,

00:49:19.524 --> 00:49:23.761 align:middle line:84%
and yet we separate ourselves
out as being other than the rest

00:49:23.761 --> 00:49:27.298 align:middle line:84%
of the animal kingdom and
that there is natural prey

00:49:27.298 --> 00:49:29.400 align:middle line:90%
and there is a natural affinity

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.936 align:middle line:84%
for hunting among
the animal kingdom,

00:49:31.936 --> 00:49:37.675 align:middle line:84%
why are humans not
considered natural predators?

00:49:37.675 --> 00:49:39.777 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think
it's good question.

00:49:39.777 --> 00:49:41.846 align:middle line:84%
There's, you know,
archeological evidence

00:49:41.846 --> 00:49:44.415 align:middle line:84%
that we were both hunting
and scavenging as, you know,

00:49:44.415 --> 00:49:47.585 align:middle line:84%
hominids or pre-humans
millions of years ago,

00:49:47.585 --> 00:49:49.420 align:middle line:84%
a million to two
million years ago.

00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:53.257 align:middle line:84%
So and chimpanzees
also hunt monkeys.

00:49:53.257 --> 00:49:55.426 align:middle line:84%
You know, it doesn't-- that's
not the bulk of their diet

00:49:55.426 --> 00:50:01.165 align:middle line:84%
but it's part of the
primate experience, you know?

00:50:01.165 --> 00:50:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.903 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think the argument
is that though we might

00:50:05.903 --> 00:50:10.007 align:middle line:84%
in some sense be natural
predators we're also very

00:50:10.007 --> 00:50:11.809 align:middle line:90%
cultural predators.

00:50:11.809 --> 00:50:15.279 align:middle line:84%
If we are predators it's
very culturally constructed

00:50:15.279 --> 00:50:18.116 align:middle line:84%
and framed in very
different ways, in, you know,

00:50:18.116 --> 00:50:19.750 align:middle line:84%
in different cultures
around the world.

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:25.156 align:middle line:84%
So, some cultures values will
say, "We hunt in this way

00:50:25.156 --> 00:50:29.026 align:middle line:84%
but we don't hunt at all or
we hunt in this other ways."

00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:33.998 align:middle line:84%
And so it is certainly not
just nature expressing itself,

00:50:33.998 --> 00:50:37.902 align:middle line:84%
it's perhaps some kind of
nature expressing itself and lot

00:50:37.902 --> 00:50:40.872 align:middle line:84%
of cultural and culture
expressing themselves as well.

00:50:40.872 --> 00:50:46.210 align:middle line:84%
>> On that note let's talk
about the Africans and the kudu.

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:48.846 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that
and I also want to get

00:50:48.846 --> 00:50:53.651 align:middle line:84%
into the Tibetan path for
consuming animal flesh

00:50:53.651 --> 00:50:56.254 align:middle line:84%
which is what quite
convoluted and interesting.

00:50:56.254 --> 00:50:58.523 align:middle line:84%
So, we see how we
each deal with this,

00:50:58.523 --> 00:51:01.292 align:middle line:84%
how different cultures deal with
it, let's talk about the kudu.

00:51:01.292 --> 00:51:06.063 align:middle line:84%
>> Sure. So, in one of David
Attenborough's nature series I

00:51:06.063 --> 00:51:11.435 align:middle line:84%
believe in it's in the series
Mammals, the last section

00:51:11.435 --> 00:51:13.771 align:middle line:84%
of that is about
the human mammal

00:51:13.771 --> 00:51:20.244 align:middle line:90%
and he has a wonderful scene

00:51:20.244 --> 00:51:26.551 align:middle line:84%
where several Kalahari san
Bushmen are hunting a kudu

00:51:26.551 --> 00:51:28.019 align:middle line:90%
and this is this ancient form

00:51:28.019 --> 00:51:29.854 align:middle line:84%
of hunting called
the persistence hunt

00:51:29.854 --> 00:51:34.926 align:middle line:84%
which means they chase it down,
they run for hours tracking

00:51:34.926 --> 00:51:40.765 align:middle line:84%
with incredible skill until the
animal basically falls over.

00:51:40.765 --> 00:51:48.005 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that before I
started hunting, in the end one

00:51:48.005 --> 00:51:53.144 align:middle line:84%
of the hunters kills, kills
the kudu and then kneels

00:51:53.144 --> 00:51:59.417 align:middle line:84%
down beside it and
sprinkled sand on it,

00:51:59.417 --> 00:52:01.519 align:middle line:84%
and just like holy water,
the way he does it it's

00:52:01.519 --> 00:52:04.889 align:middle line:84%
like a priest, you know,
sprinkling holy water

00:52:04.889 --> 00:52:08.259 align:middle line:84%
and he take some saliva
from the corner of his mouth

00:52:08.259 --> 00:52:10.695 align:middle line:84%
and rubs his own legs which
are aching after eight hours

00:52:10.695 --> 00:52:13.164 align:middle line:90%
or something of running.

00:52:13.164 --> 00:52:15.132 align:middle line:84%
>> The warrior rubs--
the hunter rubs--

00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:16.267 align:middle line:90%
>> On his own legs.

00:52:16.267 --> 00:52:18.002 align:middle line:84%
>> -- his legs with the
saliva from the kudu?

00:52:18.002 --> 00:52:21.305 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, to ease the
pain and he sits there

00:52:21.305 --> 00:52:24.141 align:middle line:84%
and strokes it and, you
know, basically, it says,

00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:26.911 align:middle line:84%
a prayer of thanksgiving for
the food that will feed him,

00:52:26.911 --> 00:52:29.647 align:middle line:84%
and his family, and
his village and such.

00:52:29.647 --> 00:52:37.288 align:middle line:84%
And there was something terrible
and also beautiful about that

00:52:37.288 --> 00:52:42.426 align:middle line:84%
and it's hard to explain but it
really resonated with me in ways

00:52:42.426 --> 00:52:47.598 align:middle line:84%
that we're both sort of
heart opening and kind

00:52:47.598 --> 00:52:50.234 align:middle line:90%
of overwhelming, is awesome

00:52:50.234 --> 00:52:54.972 align:middle line:84%
in literal sense of--
the old sense of awe.

00:52:54.972 --> 00:52:59.477 align:middle line:84%
It was something that informed
the spirit of my notion

00:52:59.477 --> 00:53:02.546 align:middle line:84%
about hunting not that I'm
going to mimic the way they hunt

00:53:02.546 --> 00:53:05.283 align:middle line:84%
or their rituals per se
but the spirit of it,

00:53:05.283 --> 00:53:07.551 align:middle line:84%
something that made
a lot of sense

00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:09.053 align:middle line:84%
at a emotional or
spiritual level.

00:53:09.053 --> 00:53:11.889 align:middle line:84%
>> When there is a very
large level of investment,

00:53:11.889 --> 00:53:16.160 align:middle line:84%
and stamina, and it sounds
as though skill and heart

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.329 align:middle line:90%
on behalf of the hunters.

00:53:18.329 --> 00:53:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.697 align:middle line:90%
>> The Kalahari hunters.

00:53:19.697 --> 00:53:20.931 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:24.235 align:middle line:84%
>> Wasn't an easy, it wasn't
an easy catch for them.

00:53:24.235 --> 00:53:25.369 align:middle line:90%
>> No, not at all.

00:53:25.369 --> 00:53:28.172 align:middle line:84%
>> And then also let's
talk about the Tibetans.

00:53:28.172 --> 00:53:29.173 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:29.173 --> 00:53:30.441 align:middle line:84%
>> I-- feel this
fascinating reading this

00:53:30.441 --> 00:53:32.176 align:middle line:84%
in your book I thought,
"Well okay."

00:53:32.176 --> 00:53:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:34.045 align:middle line:90%
>> There tends to be a bit of,

00:53:34.045 --> 00:53:37.281 align:middle line:84%
it seems almost hypocrisy
in it, okay.

00:53:37.281 --> 00:53:42.286 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, [inaudible] of Dalai
Lama is not a vegetarian.

00:53:42.286 --> 00:53:48.159 align:middle line:84%
So he became vegetarian after
witnessing the slaughter

00:53:48.159 --> 00:53:52.697 align:middle line:84%
of a chicken and he writes
about this in his autobiography.

00:53:52.697 --> 00:53:55.099 align:middle line:84%
And then he-- I believe
he had hepatitis.

00:53:55.099 --> 00:53:56.701 align:middle line:84%
He has a particular
health condition

00:53:56.701 --> 00:53:58.569 align:middle line:84%
where his health
decline very quickly.

00:53:58.569 --> 00:54:01.138 align:middle line:84%
Even on a vegetarian diet I
think he may have still been

00:54:01.138 --> 00:54:04.075 align:middle line:84%
eating dairy or something but
his doctors said, "No, no,

00:54:04.075 --> 00:54:07.812 align:middle line:84%
no you have to continue to
eat some meat and flesh."

00:54:07.812 --> 00:54:10.715 align:middle line:84%
So, he relates his
own experience a bit

00:54:10.715 --> 00:54:15.052 align:middle line:84%
but he also talks about
the Tibetan Buddhist ethic,

00:54:15.052 --> 00:54:18.622 align:middle line:84%
this is back in the
1960s or '70s at least,

00:54:18.622 --> 00:54:23.094 align:middle line:84%
the Tibetan Buddhist ethic
of eating meat which is

00:54:23.094 --> 00:54:30.201 align:middle line:84%
that you can eat meat
but you can't kill

00:54:30.201 --> 00:54:33.270 align:middle line:90%
and you can't go and order it.

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:36.741 align:middle line:84%
The only-- so you can't
essentially directly trigger the

00:54:36.741 --> 00:54:37.742 align:middle line:90%
killing of an animal.

00:54:37.742 --> 00:54:39.043 align:middle line:84%
>> Or order the killing
of the animal.

00:54:39.043 --> 00:54:40.578 align:middle line:84%
>> You can't order it because
then it might be killed

00:54:40.578 --> 00:54:43.581 align:middle line:84%
specifically for
you and bad karma.

00:54:43.581 --> 00:54:44.682 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:54:44.682 --> 00:54:49.186 align:middle line:84%
>> So, the dilemma is
how do we eat them?

00:54:49.186 --> 00:54:50.488 align:middle line:90%
It was a staple local diet.

00:54:50.488 --> 00:54:52.957 align:middle line:84%
They had barley bread, and
meat, and some other things

00:54:52.957 --> 00:54:54.825 align:middle line:90%
but it was real staple.

00:54:54.825 --> 00:54:58.262 align:middle line:84%
So, they would have
local Muslims do it.

00:54:58.262 --> 00:55:02.933 align:middle line:84%
So, they would farm it out just
like we do in the supermarket.

00:55:02.933 --> 00:55:04.769 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't that ordering
it so to speak?

00:55:04.769 --> 00:55:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but I don't know
exactly what you meant

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:09.673 align:middle line:84%
by ordering, but you know,
you could go to a like I think

00:55:09.673 --> 00:55:12.943 align:middle line:84%
like a, you know, say a butcher
shop where there was meat

00:55:12.943 --> 00:55:14.879 align:middle line:84%
but you couldn't say, "I
don't see any meat here,

00:55:14.879 --> 00:55:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I'd like some meat and
then [inaudible] come

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:18.416 align:middle line:90%
up back," you know?

00:55:18.416 --> 00:55:20.484 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] You know, so
it's a very convoluted.

00:55:20.484 --> 00:55:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>> But that's not terribly
different from what we all do

00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:24.889 align:middle line:84%
when we go to the
supermarket, really.

00:55:24.889 --> 00:55:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly and that's--

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:30.161 align:middle line:84%
that's what I realized that
it was not that different.

00:55:30.161 --> 00:55:32.630 align:middle line:90%
But my sense of it was, "Gosh,

00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:34.598 align:middle line:84%
why should that be
less bad karma?"

00:55:34.598 --> 00:55:35.433 align:middle line:90%
>> You're right.

00:55:35.433 --> 00:55:36.467 align:middle line:90%
>> Should not be more bad karma?

00:55:36.467 --> 00:55:37.902 align:middle line:84%
It's like willful
ignorance [laughs].

00:55:37.902 --> 00:55:40.504 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, a will-- yes
a willful ignorance.

00:55:40.504 --> 00:55:43.007 align:middle line:84%
Was there-- you know, I've
interviewed so many people

00:55:43.007 --> 00:55:45.709 align:middle line:84%
from many different
backgrounds philosophically,

00:55:45.709 --> 00:55:48.879 align:middle line:84%
religious in terms of
religions and so forth.

00:55:48.879 --> 00:55:54.418 align:middle line:84%
And one thought that has come up
or one philosophy that has come

00:55:54.418 --> 00:55:59.223 align:middle line:84%
up a few times has been that on
a very deep and ancient level

00:55:59.223 --> 00:56:03.294 align:middle line:84%
that there has been an agreement
between the plant kingdom

00:56:03.294 --> 00:56:05.729 align:middle line:84%
and the animal kingdom,
and the animal kingdom

00:56:05.729 --> 00:56:10.401 align:middle line:84%
and the human kingdom as well
in terms of permissions to be

00:56:10.401 --> 00:56:13.137 align:middle line:84%
of service and to
give sustenance.

00:56:13.137 --> 00:56:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know that that
particularly resonates for you

00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:20.845 align:middle line:84%
but on a really deep level,
give-- just share as--

00:56:20.845 --> 00:56:24.381 align:middle line:84%
a kind of a final thought, we
only have a couple minutes left

00:56:24.381 --> 00:56:26.217 align:middle line:90%
on what this has brought back

00:56:26.217 --> 00:56:29.620 align:middle line:84%
to your life besides personal
accountability obviously.

00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:34.258 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you know, many cultural
traditions do tell these stories

00:56:34.258 --> 00:56:39.196 align:middle line:84%
about permission and about an
agreement between the hunter

00:56:39.196 --> 00:56:41.098 align:middle line:90%
and the hunted in such.

00:56:41.098 --> 00:56:43.434 align:middle line:84%
And I don't personally
have that word view.

00:56:43.434 --> 00:56:44.568 align:middle line:90%
I didn't grow up in it.

00:56:44.568 --> 00:56:47.271 align:middle line:84%
It makes sense to me in
a way but I'm not sure.

00:56:47.271 --> 00:56:52.176 align:middle line:84%
For me when I finally
took the life of a deer,

00:56:52.176 --> 00:56:56.680 align:middle line:84%
when I finally did do that in
my fourth year as a hunter,

00:56:56.680 --> 00:57:00.417 align:middle line:84%
it was devastating and I wasn't
sure I would ever do it again,

00:57:00.417 --> 00:57:04.855 align:middle line:84%
but it was the process of
doing the whole butchering,

00:57:04.855 --> 00:57:08.325 align:middle line:84%
the whole disassembly
of this animal

00:57:08.325 --> 00:57:11.962 align:middle line:84%
that though I wasn't looking
forward to it and it was sort

00:57:11.962 --> 00:57:17.434 align:middle line:84%
of unpleasant, it in itself
became a kind of ritual

00:57:17.434 --> 00:57:21.972 align:middle line:84%
through which I came to
a place, sort of a piece

00:57:21.972 --> 00:57:25.209 align:middle line:84%
with this is somehow
appropriate,

00:57:25.209 --> 00:57:29.480 align:middle line:84%
this is somehow fitting whether
the deer gave me permission

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:30.714 align:middle line:90%
or not, is another question

00:57:30.714 --> 00:57:34.218 align:middle line:84%
but somehow this is an
appropriate way of me

00:57:34.218 --> 00:57:38.489 align:middle line:84%
and the deer part of
this place on the land.

00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:43.227 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting, the whole thing.

00:57:43.227 --> 00:57:46.196 align:middle line:84%
I applaud you and
your courage to go

00:57:46.196 --> 00:57:48.299 align:middle line:84%
through that entire
journey all the way,

00:57:48.299 --> 00:57:49.466 align:middle line:90%
taking it all the way through.

00:57:49.466 --> 00:57:52.603 align:middle line:84%
I don't think most of
us would have the--

00:57:52.603 --> 00:57:55.039 align:middle line:84%
maybe a mental or
emotional stamina

00:57:55.039 --> 00:57:57.374 align:middle line:84%
to see it all the way
through, and you've done that,

00:57:57.374 --> 00:57:59.143 align:middle line:84%
and you've chronicle
it beautifully.

00:57:59.143 --> 00:57:59.710 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:00.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:58:00.945 --> 00:58:01.946 align:middle line:84%
>> -- thank you for writing
the Mindful Carnivore.

00:58:01.946 --> 00:58:04.148 align:middle line:90%
We're all in varying stages

00:58:04.148 --> 00:58:07.751 align:middle line:84%
of questioning our place
in this whole system.

00:58:07.751 --> 00:58:08.452 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:58:08.452 --> 00:58:09.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, thank you.

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.089 align:middle line:84%
>> Tovar's story is
very personal and rich

00:58:12.089 --> 00:58:14.592 align:middle line:84%
with emotional dilemma, it
certainly strikes to the heart

00:58:14.592 --> 00:58:18.128 align:middle line:84%
of what many mindful consumers
are forced to consider.

00:58:18.128 --> 00:58:20.764 align:middle line:84%
The book is titled; The Mindful
Carnivore and you can find it
