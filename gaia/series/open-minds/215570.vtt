>> REGINA MEREDITH: There's been
one consistent message about how

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.960 align:middle line:10%
to contend with these
chaotic and, for some,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.300 align:middle line:10%
even frightening times,
to return to nature.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.480 align:middle line:84%
We have a very special
guest with us today

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.110 align:middle line:84%
whose lineage is to live in
harmony with Mother Earth, which

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.950 align:middle line:84%
we all need to
start considering.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Chase Iron Eyes is a
member of the Sioux tribe.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.110 align:middle line:84%
He's here to tell
us all about how

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.030 align:middle line:84%
nature will heal our
ailing people and cultures

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.290 align:middle line:90%
and so much more.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.538 align:middle line:84%
Chase, it's wonderful to
be here with you today.

00:00:45.538 --> 00:00:47.580 align:middle line:84%
>> CHASE IRON EYES: Man,
thank you for having me.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I get
your newsletter,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.000 align:middle line:90%
so I follow what you're doing.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it having to
do with Dakota pipeline.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.420 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get
into all of that.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.020 align:middle line:84%
But first, many people
don't know your culture.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they've seen movies,
maybe read a book or two.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.450 align:middle line:84%
But to really
understand your culture

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.570 align:middle line:84%
and the modern
implications of what

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.700 align:middle line:84%
happened, even starting
with your mother

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.530 align:middle line:90%
when things started going awry.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.810 align:middle line:84%
So shall we begin talking
about your mother?

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And you're from Standing Rock
Reservation, which many people

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.880 align:middle line:84%
have heard of the Standing Rock
Reservation in North Dakota.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.680 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Yes.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.480 align:middle line:10%
>> IRON EYES: I was born in the
Black Hills of South Dakota,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.980 align:middle line:10%
what is now called South Dakota.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:40.260 align:middle line:10%
And [SPEAKING LAKOTA] is what we
call the Black Hills, the heart

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.020 align:middle line:10%
of everything that is.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And my mother, she
had a long story,

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.660 align:middle line:90%
a long, controverted history.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.120 align:middle line:84%
She was taken to a boarding
school in South Dakota,

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.440 align:middle line:90%
along with my uncle.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- since the inception
of the reservation era,

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.285 align:middle line:84%
Native people have
been through a lot.

00:02:09.285 --> 00:02:14.760 align:middle line:84%
We're still navigating an
ongoing colonial experience.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.410 align:middle line:90%
For us, it's not post-colonial.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, not at all.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.555 align:middle line:90%
You're--

00:02:19.555 --> 00:02:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Not at all.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.780 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --living in it.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: And you saw
that at Standing Rock,

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.400 align:middle line:90%
at the pipeline ordeal.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.160 align:middle line:90%
And so we lost a lot.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.960 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of--

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.043 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Can you go back
a little bit and tell--

00:02:32.043 --> 00:02:35.600 align:middle line:84%
how was your mother living,
what was her life like, and then

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.030 align:middle line:84%
the reservation
life, and then being

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.060 align:middle line:84%
taken into this
boarding system where--

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.400 align:middle line:84%
boarding school system where
tradition was encouraged

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.317 align:middle line:90%
to be forgotten about.

00:02:47.317 --> 00:02:48.117 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Yeah.

00:02:48.117 --> 00:02:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: [LAUGHS]
To say it politely.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: Before the United
States Army Corps of Engineers

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.590 align:middle line:84%
flooded the Standing
Rock reservation,

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.150 align:middle line:84%
they flooded seven different
reservations for hydropower

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:90%
for its own reasons.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.850 align:middle line:90%
They did not get our consent.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And my mother was
living off and on

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.310 align:middle line:84%
between her mother and
father's house, which

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.590 align:middle line:84%
was a square house,
American style

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.080 align:middle line:84%
house, and her grandmother,
who was a medicine woman, who

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.880 align:middle line:84%
practiced her art
and her healing ways

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.170 align:middle line:84%
on the riverbed,
which was a very--

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.220 align:middle line:84%
the most fertile
ground that we had.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.130 align:middle line:84%
We could make an
economic life from there.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.640 align:middle line:84%
All of our foods, medicines,
all of the habitats,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.730 align:middle line:84%
the riparian
habitats, everything

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.220 align:middle line:90%
that is good about heavily--

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.370 align:middle line:90%
about the ecosystems.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.680 align:middle line:90%
They're heavily wooded.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.010 align:middle line:90%
We depended on that.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And my mom spent a lot of time
with her grandmother there.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And I never got a chance to
meet my mother's grandmother,

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.420 align:middle line:84%
but I was pretty much raised
by four different grandmothers

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.980 align:middle line:90%
in my lifetime.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And she had a very
good life there,

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.810 align:middle line:84%
but she could never make
sense of the contrast of why

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.290 align:middle line:84%
does my grandmother,
who I cherish very much

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.840 align:middle line:84%
and who helps the
community, why is she living

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.310 align:middle line:84%
in this one-room shack
with a dirt floor

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.940 align:middle line:84%
in a wood stove in
relative discomforts

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:84%
compared to what her dad, who
worked for the Bureau of Indian

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.530 align:middle line:84%
Affairs, had a
nice house and was

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:40.390 align:middle line:84%
upwardly mobile in the oncoming
new political economic reality.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.930 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather, who I'm talking
about, was born in 1900.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.710 align:middle line:84%
So when we think
of Native people,

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.780 align:middle line:84%
sometimes we think
of ancient history.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.980 align:middle line:84%
But that's because of how we've
been typecast by Western media.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This
is modern history.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: It's
modern history.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.700 align:middle line:84%
This is my grandfather
that we're talking about,

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.380 align:middle line:84%
who's 10 years younger than
the state of South Dakota

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.100 align:middle line:90%
or the state of North Dakota.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:14.220 align:middle line:84%
But think of those as the
spiritual buffalo economy days

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.460 align:middle line:84%
that we had come from and
from the 1870s onward, say,

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.940 align:middle line:84%
after the Battle of Little
Bighorn, Custer's Last Stand,

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.290 align:middle line:84%
then we start learning
to speak English.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Not voluntarily at first,
but sometimes voluntarily.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.900 align:middle line:84%
But the United States, in
conjunction with the churches,

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.790 align:middle line:84%
imposed this boarding
school or residential school

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:84%
era, which that is a
euphemism for that era.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.560 align:middle line:84%
That is an era of
cultural genocide.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.348 align:middle line:90%
It's an era complete--

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:53.250 align:middle line:84%
the erasure and the degradation
of our internal dignity

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.510 align:middle line:84%
that we're born
with and that we can

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.720 align:middle line:84%
avail ourselves with
in different aspects.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.520 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us learn the
English language first now.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.300 align:middle line:84%
But for my mom and
for my grandparents,

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.320 align:middle line:90%
that wasn't the case.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
people alive today--

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.750 align:middle line:84%
and that number is
going down, but they

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.280 align:middle line:84%
learn Lakota first,
Lakhótiya Wóglaka, which

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.690 align:middle line:90%
is another software, another--

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:21.930 align:middle line:90%
it's another software.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Think of it like a
technology through which

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:30.890 align:middle line:84%
we can access different
elemental universal powers

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.520 align:middle line:90%
and relationships.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And yes, you can also get there
through the English language,

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.210 align:middle line:84%
but all of our rituals,
our ceremonies, our songs,

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.580 align:middle line:84%
our knowledge systems, all of
those are also available to us

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.220 align:middle line:84%
in our language, in
the Lakota language.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:51.450 align:middle line:84%
But she goes to boarding
school, and it's horror stories.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:56.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the stuff of
torture, humiliation.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.610 align:middle line:84%
You get caught speaking
your Native language,

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.550 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
put-- you're going

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.650 align:middle line:84%
to kneel in the
corner on a broomstick

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.930 align:middle line:84%
until they determine that
you've suffered long enough.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.860 align:middle line:90%
We've gone through that.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:16.600 align:middle line:84%
That resulted in a loss of
identity, cultural identity,

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:28.810 align:middle line:84%
pride, dignity, a working
metaphysics or a system

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:34.450 align:middle line:84%
of knowing whatever
the self is, one self,

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:40.030 align:middle line:84%
your personalized experience,
your personalized consciousness.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:84%
We were recreated through the
lens of the European imagination

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.260 align:middle line:90%
in those places.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.220 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sitting here

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: These
are not compatible.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: These are not--

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.930 align:middle line:84%
we've had to make them
compatible, because most of us

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.570 align:middle line:84%
don't speak our Lakota or
traditional Indigenous language.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.870 align:middle line:84%
There's more than
probably 300 languages

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.960 align:middle line:84%
still in what is now
called the United States.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:90%
But the times have shifted.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer termination
of tribal nations

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:18.860 align:middle line:84%
and a degradation of spiritual
and political degradation

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.250 align:middle line:90%
of Indigenous peoples.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:24.810 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to turn that
around and say, hey, look at--

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.010 align:middle line:84%
we've all been
through some trauma.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:34.820 align:middle line:84%
We've all been separated from
a natural, mystic, spiritual

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.140 align:middle line:90%
relationship with the universe.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.860 align:middle line:84%
We've all suffered that,
no matter what color

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.039 align:middle line:90%
our skin is or what our--

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, that is true.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.712 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense, that
extends to everyone.

00:08:46.712 --> 00:08:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And we've made
choices that-- where

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.420 align:middle line:84%
we've done it to
ourselves, and it's also

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.890 align:middle line:84%
been perpetuated upon
humanity by others

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.018 align:middle line:90%
as well, as we well know.

00:08:56.018 --> 00:08:58.060 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back to your
language, for a moment.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you set a simple
sentence like, I am a member--

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.430 align:middle line:84%
would you say Sioux of
the Sioux tribe then?

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:04.230 align:middle line:90%
I am a member--

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: In the legal
documents, yes, Sioux Nation.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.453 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So if you would
say, I am a member of the Sioux

00:09:09.453 --> 00:09:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Nation, what would that
sound like in your language?

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.420 align:middle line:90%
I want to feel it.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Yeah.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.055 align:middle line:84%
You would say,
[SPEAKING LAKOTA].

00:09:18.055 --> 00:09:29.130 align:middle line:90%


00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:33.270 align:middle line:84%
I belong to the
Lakota people or the--

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Oceti Sakowin is--
we were called Sioux

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.720 align:middle line:90%
because of a misinterpretation.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So your
language itself--

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.820 align:middle line:90%
thank you for that.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.400 align:middle line:84%
The language itself, I just
wanted to hear a little,

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.310 align:middle line:90%
feel a little.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.470 align:middle line:84%
The language itself clearly
isn't Germanic or Latin-based.

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:56.980 align:middle line:84%
So your language, doing
the historical study

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:90%
of the roots of language--

00:09:59.020 --> 00:09:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Yes.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:01.765 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --etymology
and some of the other.

00:10:01.765 --> 00:10:03.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I remember
reading some--

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle line:84%
a couple of books I read had to
do with their Iroquois language

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.810 align:middle line:84%
being at the root of
very, very ancient--

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.940 align:middle line:84%
other places in the languages
in other parts of the world.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:90%
What is your language?

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.870 align:middle line:84%
What do you know
about your language

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.380 align:middle line:90%
and where it stemmed from?

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a completely
different vibration.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.537 align:middle line:84%
And to have to cut that off
and go into a Germanic language

00:10:24.537 --> 00:10:27.550 align:middle line:84%
no less, thinking and
acting, just the language

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.330 align:middle line:90%
itself would change everything.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.942 align:middle line:90%


00:10:31.942 --> 00:10:33.317 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES:
Language, Lakolya--

00:10:33.317 --> 00:10:36.059 align:middle line:90%


00:10:36.059 --> 00:10:43.930 align:middle line:84%
the [LAKOTA], the [LAKOTA],
the teachings and the language

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:47.738 align:middle line:90%
itself has otherworldly origins.

00:10:47.738 --> 00:10:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what I'm wondering.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.780 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: This is a long
story, and that's a long story.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:58.290 align:middle line:84%
But it involves the
creation of the universe

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:05.070 align:middle line:84%
and the order of creation,
divine creation, sometimes

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.730 align:middle line:84%
self-determined creation because
these gods or these spirits

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.440 align:middle line:90%
have their own ambitions.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.680 align:middle line:90%
They have their own intentions.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And one particular-- he's not
a god or he's not really a he,

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.790 align:middle line:90%
but it is not a god.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:28.110 align:middle line:84%
It is a servant, a role
player, this entity that

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:33.630 align:middle line:84%
served the good spirits and even
the bad spirit, you might say.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:34.870 align:middle line:90%
They're all one.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And this particular entity
named Kssa served these gods.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And there was a time
when he would serve--

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:47.130 align:middle line:84%
they would serve these
gods even white foods

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.760 align:middle line:90%
underneath the earth.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And this particular person,
entity was ashamed of his form.

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And so these negative
forces capitalized

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:58.700 align:middle line:90%
on that, exploited that.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.200 align:middle line:90%
They like to cause mischief.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.180 align:middle line:84%
They like to embarrass
the good gods.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And they convinced
this particular entity

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:11.620 align:middle line:84%
to go along with their
schemes, and this-- so he

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.620 align:middle line:84%
participated in embarrassing
the gods, and he was punished,

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.550 align:middle line:84%
or it was punished and
stripped of his title,

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.940 align:middle line:90%
and he became the trickster.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And it is said that
this entity taught--

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.870 align:middle line:84%
before he became the trickster,
he taught the language.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.240 align:middle line:90%
He taught Lakota.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.240 align:middle line:84%
This entity named
things in the universe.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where our
language comes from.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So is it fair to say,
you know how the world is today

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:44.030 align:middle line:84%
and all the subjects
we do here on Gaia,

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:48.020 align:middle line:84%
that this trickster was an off--
from an off planet culture,

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:52.590 align:middle line:84%
from another planetary system as
a physical being who came here

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.430 align:middle line:90%
among other physical beings?

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Yeah.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.060 align:middle line:84%
I never thought of
it in that context,

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.920 align:middle line:90%
but he's certainly otherworldly.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.150 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: And you
could even say that this--

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:06.707 align:middle line:84%
and this trickster was
banished here, this--

00:13:06.707 --> 00:13:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: To Earth.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: --Gaia, mama
Gaia [SPEAKING LAKOTA].

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, was
that a punishment?

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: Yeah,
it was a punishment.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.250 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just him.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:19.150 align:middle line:84%
It was those who convinced
him and those who helped him.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.820 align:middle line:90%
And they have names.

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And they're real forces,
you know what I'm saying.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:23.500 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And are these real
forces still present today?

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Absolutely.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Are they present
beyond just the influence

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.730 align:middle line:84%
of your tribe, but
greater influence?

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: The
two-legged being, that's us.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:41.110 align:middle line:84%
The [LAKOTA], the-- we used
to be the [LAKOTA] or the--

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.805 align:middle line:84%
we were a different form,
maybe, under the earth.

00:13:43.805 --> 00:13:46.380 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
we had this same--

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.560 align:middle line:90%
we had the same bones.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:56.300 align:middle line:84%
The bones that are in US, the
organs, the flesh and blood,

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:03.230 align:middle line:84%
the water that is in us,
those are ancient powers.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:09.040 align:middle line:84%
The water that is inside of us
and the divine composition that

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.845 align:middle line:84%
generates consciousness
and allows us to navigate.

00:14:13.845 --> 00:14:17.260 align:middle line:84%
For the longest time,
maybe Western philosophy

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.330 align:middle line:84%
thought that
consciousness might have

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:20.750 align:middle line:90%
been generated from the brain.

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:22.420 align:middle line:84%
But we're finding
out more and more--

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.170 align:middle line:84%
the brain does have a
very important role.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:26.628 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're just now
getting around to understanding

00:14:26.628 --> 00:14:28.278 align:middle line:90%
that that's not where it lives.

00:14:28.278 --> 00:14:29.570 align:middle line:90%
We're a little behind you guys.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: For
some reason, we call--

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.140 align:middle line:90%
and there's a lot.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.330 align:middle line:84%
When you mention
the word etymology,

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:38.360 align:middle line:90%
we call eye of the heart.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.908 align:middle line:84%
Just like third eye,
but eye of the heart.

00:14:40.908 --> 00:14:42.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Interesting
you should say that,

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.720 align:middle line:84%
because what I'm understanding
now is that humanity is going

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.400 align:middle line:90%
to-- consciousness rules.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.160 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is
running the show.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.050 align:middle line:90%
Can look ugly.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.050 align:middle line:84%
It's still running the
show toward a higher end.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And that one of the big upgrades
in humanity is going to be that,

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.160 align:middle line:84%
not just you, but
all of humanity

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.190 align:middle line:84%
will start running their
mind and intelligence

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:05.560 align:middle line:84%
through the intelligence of the
heart, through the heart's eye,

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:06.360 align:middle line:90%
as you say.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.000 align:middle line:90%


00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: We've struggled
so hard, even today, even--

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.370 align:middle line:90%
I was not-- I was born before--

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.910 align:middle line:84%
I had a childhood
before the internet,

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:21.460 align:middle line:84%
and my children don't
have that childhood.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:25.570 align:middle line:84%
They were born in the smart
generation with the artificial--

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.680 align:middle line:84%
with the thing, with the
screen, the thing that

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.300 align:middle line:84%
is connecting and
drawing your energy.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.800 align:middle line:90%
Because those are real--

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.715 align:middle line:90%
those are elements.

00:15:33.715 --> 00:15:34.515 align:middle line:90%
Those are--

00:15:34.515 --> 00:15:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Talk
about tricksters.

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: Yes,
talk about tricksters.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
live our-- what

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:90%
might be called a mythology.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't have the Western
academic background

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:54.898 align:middle line:84%
for talking about how
the West has studied--

00:15:54.898 --> 00:15:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Consciousness.

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: --consciousness,
mythology, all of that.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:59.580 align:middle line:90%
But that's my walk of life.

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:00.380 align:middle line:90%
I live there.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:01.940 align:middle line:90%
That's where I love to be.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And so for instance, when I got
exposed to Joseph Campbell, just

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.710 align:middle line:84%
as an example, then it
got me interested in,

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:12.740 align:middle line:84%
how does this
English-speaking world now,

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:17.240 align:middle line:84%
how are they viewing
Indigenous cultural mythology?

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:23.242 align:middle line:84%
How is it creating this reality
that I'm having to navigate?

00:16:23.242 --> 00:16:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That is
your lived experience.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.658 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: That's
my lived experience.

00:16:26.658 --> 00:16:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And now this is-- now you also
have the ceremonial elders, who

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:36.880 align:middle line:84%
are very much still here, who I
would love to see them on Gaia

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.090 align:middle line:90%
or-- you know what I mean?

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Just coming out and
building bridges,

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.740 align:middle line:90%
because that's what I've done.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.060 align:middle line:90%
I have a gift for that.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Throughout the course
of my life, I can see.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and
you're well-educated.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.190 align:middle line:90%
You're an attorney.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.800 align:middle line:84%
You understand how
this world works now.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Yes.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: This world.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.722 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Absolutely.

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And there's still are people who
are keeping the ancient fires

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:04.218 align:middle line:84%
burning and making
sure that our--

00:17:04.218 --> 00:17:09.160 align:middle line:84%
the substance and depth of what
we are is going to live on.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.069 align:middle line:84%
It won't be absorbed
and consumed

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:15.260 align:middle line:84%
by this thing that has done it
to all of Europe's Indigenous

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:16.060 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:16.569 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:17.369 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:20.130 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: --over the years,
or the centuries, I should say.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:23.400 align:middle line:84%
So I've had that realization
that, look, we're

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.550 align:middle line:90%
all our souls or our spirits.

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:30.400 align:middle line:90%
We're grieving for ceremony.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.780 align:middle line:90%
We're grieving for ritual.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.560 align:middle line:84%
We're grieving for
a connection to be

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.210 align:middle line:90%
received from divine powers.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's what our
ceremonies do for us.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And I come from a lineage of
people that want to share that.

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what would
happen if you were to do

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.937 align:middle line:90%
your ceremonies in English?

00:17:48.937 --> 00:17:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Sometimes they do.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:51.478 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: But I mean, what--

00:17:51.478 --> 00:17:55.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to get my mind around
going from such a completely

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.920 align:middle line:84%
different, rich, possibly
even star-driven language,

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.660 align:middle line:84%
and then having to convert that
into a Germanic language, which

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.890 align:middle line:84%
is certainly one
thing about Germanic--

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:10.270 align:middle line:84%
the Germanic languages, is
they're less emotionally

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.250 align:middle line:84%
charged, generally
speaking, although we have

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.725 align:middle line:90%
some good expletives available.

00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:15.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:19.820 align:middle line:84%
But where your language has a
more-- kind of a more round--

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.760 align:middle line:84%
a very round, full,
ancient feeling to it.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And what we form in our
mouths has a huge impact

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:27.210 align:middle line:90%
on our vibrations.

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.010 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Yes.

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:30.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So that's why I
said, what would it feel like

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.700 align:middle line:84%
to suddenly switch and do your
same ceremony from the Native

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:34.610 align:middle line:90%
tongue to English?

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.428 align:middle line:84%
What would that feel
like inside even?

00:18:36.428 --> 00:18:37.970 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: We
don't know that yet.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, we don't
ever have to know that.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:44.400 align:middle line:84%
But some of our scholars,
some of our people

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.840 align:middle line:84%
don't believe that we would
receive the same power

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.690 align:middle line:90%
exchange--

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:50.773 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Probably, yeah.

00:18:50.773 --> 00:18:53.110 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: --if
It wasn't in Lakolya.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And you're right on, the
[LAKOTA] and-- the tongue

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.000 align:middle line:90%
and the voice, [LAKOTA].

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.750 align:middle line:90%
The voice is sacred.

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.160 align:middle line:90%
The voice is powerful.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:07.120 align:middle line:84%
The voice can create,
and it can destroy.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's it say-- that's what
[LAKOTA] means to us, sacred.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.010 align:middle line:90%
The drum.

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:15.940 align:middle line:84%
When you're speaking of, we
have to do certain things,

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:19.300 align:middle line:84%
we meaning human
beings, we have to sing.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.160 align:middle line:84%
We have to speak
in a certain way.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.810 align:middle line:90%
We have to hit the drum.

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:26.730 align:middle line:84%
We have to do those things
because that is the thing--

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:27.790 align:middle line:90%
the conduit.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to say technology,
but you know what I mean.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.833 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
vibrational, contact.

00:19:31.833 --> 00:19:33.610 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES:
Vibrational frequency.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.010 align:middle line:90%
It brings it in.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you're right
about Lakolya,

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.970 align:middle line:84%
because I watched these
videos of Pete Catches Sr.

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And he is one of our
luminaries in the Lakota world.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.180 align:middle line:90%
He also went to boarding school.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And to hear him speak Lakota,
it almost sounds like a--

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:58.492 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like it--
like a harmony.

00:19:58.492 --> 00:19:59.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Like a song.

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: It
sounds like a song.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.960 align:middle line:90%
And it's so beautiful.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.730 align:middle line:90%
And you're right about that.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:08.770 align:middle line:84%
It's important, and
more and more of us

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:11.565 align:middle line:84%
are getting back to
speaking our language.

00:20:11.565 --> 00:20:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm so glad to
hear that, because it's--

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:16.090 align:middle line:84%
like I said, I can
feel the difference

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.070 align:middle line:90%
in the quality of the vibration.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is kind of a similar
thing happening right now

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:27.190 align:middle line:84%
in the schools in this
country where they stopped

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:29.890 align:middle line:90%
teaching cursive writing.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:31.580 align:middle line:90%
Now, for all--

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:35.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure your mother was not too
happy to learn cursive writing.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.470 align:middle line:90%
We get that.

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:41.120 align:middle line:84%
But since there-- that was the
way I was taught as a child

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.030 align:middle line:84%
and up until recently,
people were taught.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Something that
happens to the brain

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:50.000 align:middle line:84%
when you're making circles and
loops, and it's more geometric,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.810 align:middle line:90%
and they're connected together.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:54.660 align:middle line:84%
That develops the young
brain very differently,

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.990 align:middle line:84%
like the sound of your
language develops the brain

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.960 align:middle line:90%
very differently.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.280 align:middle line:90%
Now that's gone.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And now almost the
printed word is gone.

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Now it's down to
digital computer keys.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And a lot is lost
in our development

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.870 align:middle line:84%
in the subtle coding,
I think, when anything

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.453 align:middle line:90%
in language or writing is lost.

00:21:10.453 --> 00:21:12.980 align:middle line:90%


00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: The
language is powerful.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:17.840 align:middle line:90%
The language is the blueprint.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.672 align:middle line:84%
It's its own spirit
is what we believe.

00:21:20.672 --> 00:21:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, like in the
Bible, first there was the word.

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: First
there was the word.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.330 align:middle line:90%
First there was God's word.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:29.100 align:middle line:90%
And I'll give you an example.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.400 align:middle line:84%
When my wife moved us to the
Standing Rock Reservation--

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.622 align:middle line:84%
well, that's where I
grew up until I was 19,

00:21:34.622 --> 00:21:36.330 align:middle line:84%
I was raised on the
Standing Rock Nation.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.380 align:middle line:90%
And I had gone off to school.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:43.150 align:middle line:84%
I'd given my time and energy
to this Western academic

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:45.680 align:middle line:84%
experience, and I learned
great things there.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.245 align:middle line:90%
I learned good things there.

00:21:47.245 --> 00:21:51.230 align:middle line:84%
I studied a bit of political
philosophy, and I loved it.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:53.780 align:middle line:84%
I liked it, and I loved
it, and it activated me.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:54.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.090 align:middle line:84%
You had the intellectual
challenge of this whole--

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:56.350 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Yeah.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:57.040 align:middle line:90%
It was--

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --landscape.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:58.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.780 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: I appreciate it.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:04.150 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: And
then I ended up back--

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.980 align:middle line:84%
we ended up back proximate
to the reservation,

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.190 align:middle line:84%
and my wife took a job on the
Standing Rock Reservation.

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:11.090 align:middle line:90%
So I moved back.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:12.140 align:middle line:90%
We all moved back.

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And the gentleman who was
giving me a tour of the house,

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.910 align:middle line:90%
he's a speaker.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:17.960 align:middle line:90%
He's Lakota.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.860 align:middle line:84%
His name is Councilman
Richard-- he's a Councilman now,

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.090 align:middle line:90%
Richard Long Feather.

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:26.004 align:middle line:84%
But he comes up to me and
he says, [SPEAKING LAKOTA].

00:22:26.004 --> 00:22:31.150 align:middle line:90%


00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:32.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing all right.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:35.440 align:middle line:84%
He's just asking
me how I'm doing.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:39.450 align:middle line:84%
He was raised by old people, so
he thinks that I'm a speaker.

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And he just starts going off
in Lakota for the full tour.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:48.240 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, he looked
at me and he goes, [LAKOTA],

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.980 align:middle line:84%
do you understand
what I'm saying?

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:50.847 align:middle line:90%
And I--

00:22:50.847 --> 00:22:51.701 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A little bit.

00:22:51.701 --> 00:22:54.159 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: [LAKOTA], a little
bit, you know what I mean?

00:22:54.159 --> 00:22:57.170 align:middle line:84%
I can-- But after he spoke
the language to me for about--

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:01.160 align:middle line:84%
only about five minutes, I go
out to my car, and I'm in tears,

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.105 align:middle line:90%
and I can feel--

00:23:02.105 --> 00:23:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, activated.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: I can feel
something being secreted,

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.042 align:middle line:90%
either on my skull or spine,

00:23:08.042 --> 00:23:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: --you might say.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- I don't
know what the word is.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.880 align:middle line:90%
It's subliming me.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.450 align:middle line:90%
It's just taking over me.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.025 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you're going
into almost a euphoric opening,

00:23:21.025 --> 00:23:21.330 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:22.747 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES:
There's a vibration.

00:23:22.747 --> 00:23:26.430 align:middle line:84%
I just feel one of the best
I've ever felt in my life.

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:27.230 align:middle line:90%
Just from--

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:28.813 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Just
hearing that language.

00:23:28.813 --> 00:23:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Yes.

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:30.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Beautiful.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, no, I just
had to ask you--

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:34.230 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't planned on going
down that rabbit hole,

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.980 align:middle line:84%
but it seems like it's
so important in terms

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:40.760 align:middle line:84%
of the preservation of not
just your tradition, but higher

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:44.090 align:middle line:84%
frequencies from here
or elsewhere that really

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:45.985 align:middle line:90%
can't afford to be obliterated.

00:23:45.985 --> 00:23:48.520 align:middle line:84%
You need to keep
those frequencies.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.862 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go
back for a second.

00:23:50.862 --> 00:23:54.920 align:middle line:84%
You said the trickster
got the people who

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.220 align:middle line:84%
were living inside the
earth, and many stories

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.020 align:middle line:90%
are coming up now.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.820 align:middle line:84%
The Radu Cinamar
books are all about

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.530 align:middle line:84%
the cultures living inside
the Earth, the tunneling down,

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:07.070 align:middle line:84%
the stuff going on, the
holographic chambers

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:09.330 align:middle line:84%
inside the earth, a
lot of stuff in those.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And another book by Sarah
Breskman, who I interviewed--

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:13.440 align:middle line:90%
she does regressions.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.690 align:middle line:84%
I'll bring something up on
that later, a little later.

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:20.180 align:middle line:84%
But people talking about
the Tuatha Dé Danann

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.340 align:middle line:84%
and some of the other
realms of beings

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.960 align:middle line:84%
living on the
inside of the earth

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:90%
and then coming to the surface.

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying that your
people were on the inside,

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.630 align:middle line:84%
and they were tricked into
coming onto the surface.

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was kind of, as I
recall, summertime conditions.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:35.420 align:middle line:90%
Like, this isn't so bad, until--

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Yes.

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --winter came.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.840 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: That trickster
was living here with two other--

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.998 align:middle line:84%
it's called
double-faced woman and--

00:24:43.998 --> 00:24:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that doesn't
sound good to begin with.

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:48.266 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: [LAKOTA].

00:24:48.266 --> 00:24:52.560 align:middle line:84%
These are figures
in our worldview.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And so the trickster went in--
sent a wolf laden with a pack.

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And in that pack are
all of the things that

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.970 align:middle line:84%
are going to appeal to
the two-legged being,

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:07.712 align:middle line:84%
or the beings that
are underneath there.

00:25:07.712 --> 00:25:10.160 align:middle line:90%
What became us, what was us.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And first opens up the most
beautiful song from one

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:19.820 align:middle line:84%
of maybe a meadowlark or
a songbird from the earth.

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:24.650 align:middle line:84%
And then shows them the most
beautiful blooming flower

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:27.900 align:middle line:84%
and lets them smell it,
shows them a smoked hide,

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:33.392 align:middle line:84%
smell this smoked hide,
hear these beautiful songs.

00:25:33.392 --> 00:25:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Come hither.

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: Everything
that appeals to the senses.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Touch these soft
furs and soft hides.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.720 align:middle line:10%
And then the final
thing was now,

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.140 align:middle line:10%
taste this meat,
this Buffalo meat.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:48.780 align:middle line:10%
And when we tasted the--

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.780 align:middle line:10%
see, we weren't supposed
to come to the surface.

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:53.280 align:middle line:84%
But when we tasted the Buffalo
meat, then we're like, OK.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I'm in.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.880 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: I'm
going to disobey God.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.925 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: I'm
going to disobey God,

00:25:57.925 --> 00:26:00.620 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to the
surface with this--

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.010 align:middle line:90%
this entity here.

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Every culture has a story
like that where they

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.920 align:middle line:90%
emerge into this other world.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.287 align:middle line:90%
And it's also--

00:26:12.287 --> 00:26:14.120 align:middle line:84%
I know from some of the
Eastern traditions--

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what--

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:19.420 align:middle line:84%
I read some of the Bhagavad
Gita, maybe the song of god

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and Krishna's counsel
in the time of war.

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:25.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm interested in a lot of
other seekers and seekers

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.700 align:middle line:90%
in different cultures.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:32.840 align:middle line:84%
But they talk about the nine
gates to the kingdom of heaven,

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.120 align:middle line:84%
I think it is, or
the city of heaven

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.260 align:middle line:84%
being the two eyes, the
nostrils, the mouth, the ears,

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:39.060 align:middle line:90%
the--

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:39.977 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The senses?

00:26:39.977 --> 00:26:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: --sex organ, the
digestive organ, and the senses.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.450 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:46.250 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: --is we have
this high righteous knowledge,

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:54.330 align:middle line:84%
this ancient knowledge, but it's
been completely downplayed--

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:58.170 align:middle line:84%
they tell a story like
we're some primitive people.

00:26:58.170 --> 00:26:59.578 align:middle line:90%
We're Stone Age people.

00:26:59.578 --> 00:27:01.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yeah, we were
alive during the Stone Age,

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.550 align:middle line:84%
but we just had-- we
had different goals.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And so we emerged
onto the earth.

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.550 align:middle line:90%
We disobeyed God.

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And the trickster looked
at us, summertime went by.

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:20.070 align:middle line:84%
It began to get so cold
that we couldn't live.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.517 align:middle line:90%
And we went-- we ran back--

00:27:21.517 --> 00:27:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No birds.

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:22.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: We ran back to
the cave in the Black Hills.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:25.770 align:middle line:90%
It's still there.

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the National Park,
Wind Cave National Park.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.178 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes,
I've read about it.

00:27:29.178 --> 00:27:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: And we said,
God, we made a mistake.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Too bad.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:34.877 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Too bad.

00:27:34.877 --> 00:27:36.937 align:middle line:84%
You're there now, and
you have to endure.

00:27:36.937 --> 00:27:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Kind of like
everybody else here.

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Yes.

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:41.028 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You guys
weren't exempt.

00:27:41.028 --> 00:27:41.980 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:43.490 align:middle line:90%
Here we all are.

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:48.710 align:middle line:84%
But the good thing is,
with the Native Americans,

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:51.580 align:middle line:84%
the people here,
there was-- there

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.680 align:middle line:84%
continued to be
a connection with

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.760 align:middle line:84%
and a reverence for Mother
Earth and nature itself,

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:01.240 align:middle line:84%
which was certainly lost over
the last couple of centuries

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.720 align:middle line:90%
of industrialization.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And this seems to me, it doesn't
even matter who I'm talking to,

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:09.590 align:middle line:84%
who I'm interviewing,
what book I'm reading.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Our path to truth is to get
rid of the trickster, which

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.880 align:middle line:84%
is everything we're being
led to believe right, back

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.230 align:middle line:84%
to nature and our essential
selves and our hearts, right?

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Yes.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:26.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so this is where
the Native Americans have a big

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:28.940 align:middle line:84%
jump on the rest
of us around here.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: We all have
senses, and we have--

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.910 align:middle line:90%
my reason, consciousness.

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:38.730 align:middle line:84%
We have different words
for those concepts.

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I don't even know
if they translate directly,

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:44.600 align:middle line:90%
but we are--

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.080 align:middle line:90%
there's an order.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:49.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a divine
order of creation.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And the earth herself,
itself, is a god,

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:59.310 align:middle line:84%
is a divine entity, a
powerful entity that is--

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: --very, very old.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: Maybe 5
to 8 billion years old.

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:05.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't even know what--

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:07.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They say even
older, I think, in the Vedas.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:08.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: But we also--

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:16.970 align:middle line:84%
we have earth origins of blood
clot, simple life or organism,

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:17.840 align:middle line:90%
what do you call it?

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Maybe cellular.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.720 align:middle line:84%
We just have-- we just
call that [LAKOTA],

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.200 align:middle line:84%
like the infinitesimally
small things.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.960 align:middle line:90%
But we also have--

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:31.500 align:middle line:84%
we come through the Big
Dipper, the spirit itself.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Before you arrived
here, according to us,

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:40.620 align:middle line:84%
you determined-- you
chose to incarnate here

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:47.920 align:middle line:84%
and to achieve consciousness
and to be born.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:48.880 align:middle line:90%
You chose that.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.327 align:middle line:90%
You chose your parents.

00:29:50.327 --> 00:29:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I'm totally on
board with what you're saying.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: And then--

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: --when our body
expires and the divine flesh

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:03.250 align:middle line:84%
and blood and the bones, which
the creator, you might say,

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:07.390 align:middle line:84%
took a bit of Íŋyaŋ, the first
God, which became the stone.

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
our bones come from.

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.430 align:middle line:84%
The flesh and blood came
from Mother Earth herself.

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:15.070 align:middle line:84%
So everything that is
the flesh and blood--

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and then the water
is also separate.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.340 align:middle line:84%
That is a separate
god-like entity.

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:22.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean,
these are facts.

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:23.040 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: They're facts.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: We are born--

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES:
They're scientific--

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:24.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --out
of the elements--

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: --facts too.

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:25.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --of nature.

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:26.950 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: We
are those elements.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:27.780 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:28.905 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No arguing that.

00:30:28.905 --> 00:30:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: But
somewhere along the way,

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:34.500 align:middle line:84%
we got separated from
that sacred walk of life,

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.400 align:middle line:90%
that sacred way of knowing.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it was stole the
sacred, stole the magic of life,

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and is trying to subdue that
potential, the potential

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:52.110 align:middle line:84%
for that heightened awareness,
that heightened consciousness.

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And I even believe that the
mythology of AI and let's

00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:02.520 align:middle line:84%
go to Mars and let's colonize
Mars, we should look within.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.140 align:middle line:90%
We should look within ourselves.

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:07.070 align:middle line:84%
We should look within
the planet herself

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and figure out how to
achieve some sort of respect

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:12.480 align:middle line:90%
relationship.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Some sort of harmony
would be great.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.780 align:middle line:90%
But it's a different world now.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:23.390 align:middle line:84%
We're not anti-technology, but
we are certainly pro-sacred

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:26.270 align:middle line:84%
mythology, sacred
metaphysics, and having

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:30.240 align:middle line:84%
all human beings be able to
have that in their lives.

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's available to us.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:36.130 align:middle line:84%
But I was going to
say that the start--

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.400 align:middle line:84%
when you mentioned
star people, not only

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.770 align:middle line:84%
do we come from
the stars, but we

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:46.440 align:middle line:84%
return through the same
portal that we arrived here.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.310 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:47.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Big Dipper?

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.450 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: Through
the Big Dipper, yes.

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:53.132 align:middle line:84%
So maybe I don't know what our
state of knowledge is on that--

00:31:53.132 --> 00:31:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, that's--

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES:
--particular place.

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:55.560 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --interesting.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:56.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:00.430 align:middle line:84%
So now today then,
have your people

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:03.090 align:middle line:84%
do you think-- now, we've
got to separate people

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:05.140 align:middle line:84%
under 30 who've been
raised on devices.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a different world.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.180 align:middle line:84%
But generally speaking,
is there still

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:12.188 align:middle line:84%
the sense of gratitude
toward Mother Earth?

00:32:12.188 --> 00:32:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Absolutely.

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because gratitude
is a very high frequency,

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:18.660 align:middle line:84%
and I can't imagine a better
way to go into connection with

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth, which we
all have to do again.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: For us,
there's no separation.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:28.620 align:middle line:84%
The English language is a
tricky, little pirate commerce

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.183 align:middle line:90%
slash other--

00:32:30.183 --> 00:32:31.350 align:middle line:90%
maybe other things language.

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:35.090 align:middle line:84%
But the people who speak
Lakota, my elders--

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:40.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking of a man named Dave
Swallow who said to me, tȟókša,

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:42.680 align:middle line:84%
it's good that you have
the-- you're a lawyer

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.560 align:middle line:84%
and you got this
knowledge in that world.

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:50.480 align:middle line:84%
But with the English
language comes doubt.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.560 align:middle line:84%
He said, with the English
language comes doubt.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:54.350 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: And--

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is it inherent to the
English language or the mindset?

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Maybe.

00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:58.350 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Enhances it.

00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:59.150 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Yeah.

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's just
the software itself

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:05.840 align:middle line:84%
that's running the consciousness
allows for different things

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.830 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:09.063 align:middle line:84%
I don't know for
sure, but-- or he

00:33:09.063 --> 00:33:11.230 align:middle line:84%
could have just been
encouraging me to learn Lakota.

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: [LAUGHS]
That's what you do.

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: But we
don't see a separation.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.040 align:middle line:84%
There's a phrase we
use, [SPEAKING LAKOTA].

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.680 align:middle line:90%
Everything that is my relative.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And at some point in
somewhere-- and I can only

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:31.920 align:middle line:84%
point to maybe the
Enlightenment, or Cartesian

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.870 align:middle line:84%
philosophy where there
was a separation.

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:36.750 align:middle line:84%
The mind is separate
from the body.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Even the spirit-- they might not
even have recognized the spirit,

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.100 align:middle line:84%
but the spirit was
separate from the mind.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:43.500 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: The human--

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Everything
was parted out.

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: Everything
got abstracted over time.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Human beings no longer
had a relationship

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:50.580 align:middle line:90%
with their food source.

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:52.150 align:middle line:90%
For us, it's the Buffalo.

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:54.100 align:middle line:84%
For other cultures,
it's something else.

00:33:54.100 --> 00:34:00.060 align:middle line:84%
We no longer paid attention to
the earthly and heavenly cycles

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:04.330 align:middle line:84%
like we once did, and
all of our ceremonies.

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:09.960 align:middle line:84%
So we've suffered that as
well, this separation of--

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:14.730 align:middle line:84%
this connection that we have
internally and outwardly

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:16.900 align:middle line:90%
with the divine universe.

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:23.460 align:middle line:84%
But our ceremonies bring
it all back into unity.

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:28.280 align:middle line:84%
We create unitive,
transcendental experiences

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.880 align:middle line:84%
through the sweat
lodge, for instance,

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:35.150 align:middle line:84%
which combines all of
the sacred elements--

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:41.090 align:middle line:84%
the earth, the air,
the fire, the water.

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Does
it, more or less,

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:47.230 align:middle line:84%
then take you into an ecstatic
state of connection again with

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:48.030 align:middle line:90%
everything?

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:48.320 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Yes.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.487 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --the ceremonies?

00:34:49.487 --> 00:34:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: It provides a--

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:54.090 align:middle line:90%
it's a portal and a womb to us.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:57.330 align:middle line:90%
And it's our oldest ceremony.

00:34:57.330 --> 00:35:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's the one that
is most widespread.

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:03.630 align:middle line:90%
The Lakota people are sharers.

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:08.310 align:middle line:84%
I like to say we're small, but
we're global in our approach.

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:09.620 align:middle line:90%
Some people are not.

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Some people are like,
no, let's not do that.

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's pull you
back a little bit.

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:16.680 align:middle line:90%
And I respect that.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:17.540 align:middle line:90%
But I was just--

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:20.420 align:middle line:84%
I have teachers like
chief Leonard Crow

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:21.700 align:middle line:90%
Dog, who's no longer with us--

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:22.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:23.285 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: But
he was-- it was--

00:35:23.285 --> 00:35:23.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wounded Knee.

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: --because
of people like him, yes,

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:29.640 align:middle line:84%
that the sweat lodge ceremony,
the sundance ceremony has gained

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:37.440 align:middle line:84%
at least a Western Hemispheric
presence and respect and created

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.610 align:middle line:90%
allies of the Lakota people.

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:40.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That is true.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:47.190 align:middle line:84%
But I also wonder how you feel
about essentially the white man

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.790 align:middle line:90%
also co-opting--

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: Oh,
that's a problem.

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:51.780 align:middle line:90%
That--

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It seems like
it would be a problem--

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:55.542 align:middle line:84%
it seems like it
would be a problem.

00:35:55.542 --> 00:35:57.250 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: It's
definitely a problem--

00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:59.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I can't tell you
how many white Native American

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:02.080 align:middle line:90%
shamans want to be interviewed.

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES:
They're seeking too.

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:06.520 align:middle line:90%
They're seeking a connection.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I know that, and
there's nothing wrong with that.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:12.302 align:middle line:84%
But from your point of view,
it seems like co-opting to me.

00:36:12.302 --> 00:36:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: It's co-opting.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know a
whole lot, and there's

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.900 align:middle line:84%
a concept called
[LAKOTA] in our language,

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:26.180 align:middle line:84%
which means having a
humility about things,

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:30.050 align:middle line:84%
like an innate experience
or innate respect.

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:33.350 align:middle line:84%
There's just certain things
that we wouldn't do--

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:36.350 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't mess around
with certain things,

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:38.570 align:middle line:84%
because we respect
them too much,

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:41.220 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to have
real-life consequences.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:44.250 align:middle line:84%
Benefits, blessings,
consequences.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:47.120 align:middle line:90%
All of that comes from--

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.340 align:middle line:84%
it's seeking out
that connection.

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:54.480 align:middle line:84%
It takes a person to
take that step forward.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.120 align:middle line:84%
If you want to know
more, then, hey,

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.150 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have to
go into a sweat lodge

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:00.725 align:middle line:90%
and purify yourself.

00:37:00.725 --> 00:37:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So
let's look at that.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:03.930 align:middle line:84%
So people listening
are thinking,

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:07.140 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, my soul, I can
feel I need this purification.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.940 align:middle line:84%
I need this connection
with nature.

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:10.700 align:middle line:90%
And what a beautiful language.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And getting some
kind of desire--

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Yes.

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:15.708 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --worked up.

00:37:15.708 --> 00:37:16.970 align:middle line:90%
And how do they do that?

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
your ceremonies are

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:20.280 align:middle line:84%
closed and they're
for your people.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.710 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Yeah.

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:26.130 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of-- a lot of
our people have already--

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:29.560 align:middle line:84%
they've already done what
I'm doing right now with you,

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:34.060 align:middle line:84%
which is exploring in a
very respectful, potent way

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:37.560 align:middle line:84%
the depths and the
sources of what we are

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.980 align:middle line:90%
and how we're connected.

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:41.800 align:middle line:90%
I can-- John Fire Lame Deer.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Chief Leonard Crow Dog,
there's a less known--

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:47.490 align:middle line:84%
he wouldn't write a book,
but he was my first teacher.

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:50.670 align:middle line:84%
His name is Sunny
Richards, and I could not

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:52.030 align:middle line:90%
get him to write a book.

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:54.400 align:middle line:84%
But he said, if there's a
book that could be written,

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:59.700 align:middle line:84%
it's about the dark arts
and how human beings

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.500 align:middle line:90%
are susceptible to--

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, boy, yes.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.990 align:middle line:90%
The manipulation of--

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: That
negative source of it.

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.797 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, we're
watching it all play out.

00:38:06.797 --> 00:38:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: And human beings--
we're only human beings.

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So we try to be good, and
we try to redeem ourselves,

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:17.020 align:middle line:90%
and we try to walk in that way.

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:17.820 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.153 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: But we're vulnerable.

00:38:19.153 --> 00:38:20.440 align:middle line:90%
We're credulous people.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.435 align:middle line:90%
We're human.

00:38:21.435 --> 00:38:22.235 align:middle line:90%
We're credulous.

00:38:22.235 --> 00:38:23.035 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Yes.

00:38:23.035 --> 00:38:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We tend to absorb
what we're exposed to, and a lot

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.880 align:middle line:84%
of it is driven by
trauma and fear, sadly,

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.338 align:middle line:84%
which once you're in trauma,
you'll believe anything pretty

00:38:31.338 --> 00:38:32.138 align:middle line:90%
much.

00:38:32.138 --> 00:38:33.030 align:middle line:90%
You're wide open.

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:35.330 align:middle line:84%
So learning without
trauma and fear

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:38.390 align:middle line:84%
more along the lines of
appreciation, gratitude.

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:41.165 align:middle line:84%
Like you're talking about
being in unity or harmony.

00:38:41.165 --> 00:38:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: You may have
heard of like Black Elk.

00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:44.258 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:38:44.258 --> 00:38:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: He became
Nicholas Black Elk.

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:48.840 align:middle line:90%
He might become a Saint.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.910 align:middle line:90%
He's nominated for sainthood--

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, lovely.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Yes.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:57.950 align:middle line:84%
But like, we know the
descendants of Mr.--

00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:59.860 align:middle line:90%
Black's Elk is a--

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:03.210 align:middle line:84%
the fact that he hooked up with
a non-native guy, a white guy,

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:06.290 align:middle line:84%
a European guy, John
G. Neihardt, and they

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:07.980 align:middle line:90%
wrote Black Elk Speaks.

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:11.330 align:middle line:84%
They wrote other things too,
but that was the first book

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:16.320 align:middle line:84%
that I read that
sent me on a journey.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:20.730 align:middle line:84%
I was raised not in any way
as a-- in a Christian way,

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:22.140 align:middle line:90%
but a lot of Native people are.

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:23.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to say
anything about that.

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:27.321 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying that my mom
took me to Native ceremony.

00:39:27.321 --> 00:39:28.196 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wonderful.

00:39:28.196 --> 00:39:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: [SPEAKING LAKOTA].

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:33.250 align:middle line:84%
We would go-- she would
take me to the ceremonies.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the
ceremonies as a kid.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.240 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
what was going on,

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.570 align:middle line:84%
but I remember
being there, and I

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:43.410 align:middle line:84%
remember having divine
experiences, you might say,

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:48.990 align:middle line:84%
things that challenge the
laws of physics or somebody's

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:51.580 align:middle line:84%
understanding of
how reality works.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:55.470 align:middle line:84%
It's all fluid, and
it's all up for--

00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:58.860 align:middle line:90%
it's relative, you might say.

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you can trust your
senses for a lot of things,

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:04.080 align:middle line:84%
but you should also
be aware that there

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:07.680 align:middle line:84%
are other potentialities
that are there.

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:12.330 align:middle line:84%
That are there for us to
access, for us to heal.

00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And so from Black Elk's
time to, I would say--

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:20.610 align:middle line:84%
even the gentleman, the Lakota
people who sat with a guy

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:24.530 align:middle line:84%
named James Walker five years
after the Wounded Knee Massacre.

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:27.190 align:middle line:84%
This doctor shows up on
the Pine Ridge Reservation,

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:29.500 align:middle line:84%
and he begins to
interface-- he's

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.240 align:middle line:84%
trying to treat tuberculosis,
an outbreak of that.

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:36.060 align:middle line:84%
So he says, I can't handle
this in my own Western medical

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:36.860 align:middle line:90%
training.

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:40.280 align:middle line:84%
I need the help of these
shaman, of these [LAKOTA],

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.050 align:middle line:90%
these intercessors.

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And so he obtains the help of
people like American Horse, who

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:51.310 align:middle line:84%
is the grandfather of
people like Rick Two Dogs,

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:54.400 align:middle line:90%
who Rick doesn't do a lot of--

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.080 align:middle line:90%
these are guys--

00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Rick Two Dogs and Dickey
Moves Camp are probably the--

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.800 align:middle line:84%
those two plus Crow Dog were
like the most well respected

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:08.440 align:middle line:90%
spiritual people of our nation.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And Dickey Moves Camp,
we've talked to him.

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.170 align:middle line:90%
He has a book out there.

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Things are out there that are
available to your audience

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:21.940 align:middle line:90%
to study, to go further in.

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Some of the books that
I'm referencing, they all

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.290 align:middle line:90%
have names John Fire Lame Deer.

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:29.280 align:middle line:84%
I never met John Fire, but
my first medicine man teacher

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:34.067 align:middle line:84%
did, and also was a disciple
of Chief Frank Fools Crow.

00:41:34.067 --> 00:41:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We have
a few minutes left,

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:38.200 align:middle line:84%
and I want to get to what's
happening with the pipeline,

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.840 align:middle line:84%
but also just bring
us up to date.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:45.120 align:middle line:84%
But also, from your
perspective, the way in which

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:49.110 align:middle line:84%
we approach with and engage
this beautiful planet and all

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:53.020 align:middle line:84%
of her plants and sentient
creatures, all of the animals,

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:57.250 align:middle line:84%
how, from a Native
American point of view,

00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:59.340 align:middle line:84%
do we go into harmony
with all of that,

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:03.300 align:middle line:84%
besides gratitude
and appreciation?

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:08.130 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: The reason why
Native people are constantly

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:09.580 align:middle line:90%
defending Mother Earth--

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:12.600 align:middle line:84%
it may appear to mean to
mainstream-- that we're always

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.450 align:middle line:84%
protesting
development, but that's

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:18.310 align:middle line:90%
just how it's propagandized.

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:23.830 align:middle line:84%
We have religions,
you might say,

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:26.770 align:middle line:84%
we have cultural
knowledge that connects us

00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:32.200 align:middle line:84%
to Mother Earth, that tells
us that we are composed

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:35.230 align:middle line:84%
of divine creation,
including Mother Earth,

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:39.580 align:middle line:84%
and all the other gods in our
way of knowing that there's

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:42.730 align:middle line:90%
16 gods, you might say.

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's an order
for those 16 gods.

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Our ceremonies, the way
that our mythology instills

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:57.640 align:middle line:84%
in us this innate
relationship, but more--

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:05.680 align:middle line:84%
beyond that, a covenant to
defend the rights of those

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:11.530 align:middle line:84%
nonhuman entities that are here
that predated the two-legged

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:12.330 align:middle line:90%
being here--

00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Our teachers.

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: --from
which we derive--

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:18.280 align:middle line:84%
from which we derive
our spiritual authority

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:22.420 align:middle line:84%
in our ability to heal,
to heal each other.

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:29.140 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the Buffalo,
the bear, the spider, the elk.

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:31.680 align:middle line:90%
It goes on.

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And then we're not even saying a
word about the plants, the plant

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:36.690 align:middle line:90%
nation.

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's a
whole other conversation.

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: That's
a whole other thing.

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: So we,
according to our knowledge,

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.980 align:middle line:84%
won a race against the
four-legged beings.

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And when we won,
yes, we won the right

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:50.470 align:middle line:84%
to eat and consume the
four-legged beings,

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:53.230 align:middle line:84%
but we also assume
the obligation

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:55.710 align:middle line:84%
so that the four-legged
beings and all of creation

00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:57.040 align:middle line:90%
could flourish.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we're
constantly trying to do.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:03.150 align:middle line:90%
And water is sacred to us.

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:09.810 align:middle line:84%
So when Big Oil, or anybody,
any big extractive complex,

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:15.570 align:middle line:84%
they thought that the divine,
conscious, two-legged Native

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:17.610 align:middle line:90%
people were all gone.

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:19.260 align:middle line:90%
But we're not all gone.

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that
brings us to the pipeline.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:22.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:26.603 align:middle line:84%
So just in two minutes, because
we've had so much fun talking,

00:44:26.603 --> 00:44:27.520 align:middle line:90%
we've run out of time.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:32.980 align:middle line:84%
In a couple of minutes, bring
us up to speed on the pipeline.

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:35.628 align:middle line:84%
What you're fighting
for, what's at stake,

00:44:35.628 --> 00:44:36.920 align:middle line:90%
and what they're trying to get.

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Yes.

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:41.080 align:middle line:84%
We're fighting for the
right of human beings

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:46.760 align:middle line:84%
to have livable, healthy
ecosystems and water.

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:50.180 align:middle line:84%
If you notice, where I live
now in the northern plains,

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:53.350 align:middle line:84%
March is-- the month
is [SPEAKING LAKOTA],

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:55.090 align:middle line:90%
which means the moon--

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:58.390 align:middle line:84%
when the human's eyes hurt
so much because they're

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:00.370 align:middle line:90%
snowblind from all the snow.

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:03.560 align:middle line:84%
There is no snow in the
northern plains right now.

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So something is shifting,
something is changing,

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.850 align:middle line:84%
and we need to be more conscious
about what we do with our water.

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:14.170 align:middle line:84%
All of America-- every single
person that calls themselves

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:17.830 align:middle line:84%
American or Canadian
or what have you, you--

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:20.250 align:middle line:84%
we need your help
to recognize that we

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:25.637 align:middle line:84%
need to defend our clean water
and the healthy ecosystems--

00:45:25.637 --> 00:45:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's what's
at stake with the pipeline.

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:30.262 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: That's what's
at stake with the pipeline.

00:45:30.262 --> 00:45:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's not only that, but
it's territorial integrity

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:34.690 align:middle line:90%
of the Sioux Nation.

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:37.310 align:middle line:84%
The Sioux Nation signed
treaties with the United States

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:38.110 align:middle line:90%
of America.

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:41.700 align:middle line:84%
So there's a spiritual
impetus, and there's

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:47.470 align:middle line:84%
a legal reasoning why we
do the things that we do.

00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Why scores of
thousands of people

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:53.130 align:middle line:90%
showed up at Standing Rock.

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:57.030 align:middle line:90%
Because that was a monumental--

00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:03.300 align:middle line:84%
a seismic event, a cosmic
event that shifted the world.

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And we have to try
to get to that place

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:11.410 align:middle line:84%
where we see ourselves
connected with Mother Earth,

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:14.200 align:middle line:84%
connected with
the natural world,

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.890 align:middle line:84%
and we're willing to
assert our natural rights

00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:22.090 align:middle line:84%
and defend our human rights,
our constitutional rights

00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:25.785 align:middle line:84%
from any force that seeks
to diminish those rights.

00:46:25.785 --> 00:46:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that
goes for all of us.

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: That's
all of us, together.

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We are all people
living on this beautiful planet,

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:32.240 align:middle line:84%
and that's our obligation,
for all of us--

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Yes.

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --to take care
of our beautiful host.

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:38.000 align:middle line:90%
So we're out of time.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Any final thoughts,
Chase, before we go?

00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:40.292 align:middle line:90%
There's so much--

00:46:40.292 --> 00:46:40.910 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: I cannot
believe we're out of time.

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:41.785 align:middle line:90%
Well, you know what--

00:46:41.785 --> 00:46:43.618 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Oh, I had
so many more questions,

00:46:43.618 --> 00:46:45.050 align:middle line:90%
but another conversation.

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: Yeah, another
time, another conversation.

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:52.738 align:middle line:90%
We all have to start somewhere.

00:46:52.738 --> 00:46:57.200 align:middle line:84%
I was raised in a way that
left me open, open minds.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:02.800 align:middle line:84%
But when I realized that there
was a path that I could pursue,

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:06.280 align:middle line:84%
that I couldn't learn in any
English speaking school or I

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.350 align:middle line:90%
couldn't learn really--

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:13.390 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't peer into
reality as we know it

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:15.470 align:middle line:84%
or as we've been
conditioned to know it.

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I begin to
take those steps.

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And for your listeners,
for your audience,

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.360 align:middle line:90%
congratulations on what you do.

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.245 align:middle line:90%
I have great respect for you.

00:47:24.245 --> 00:47:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Thank you.

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:31.470 align:middle line:10%
>> IRON EYES: And there is
a pathway for people to seek

00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:34.290 align:middle line:10%
spiritual liberation.

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:38.240 align:middle line:10%
And that is attainable,
achievable by every single one

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.040 align:middle line:10%
of us.

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.840 align:middle line:10%
And we have to figure
out where to start.

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:44.270 align:middle line:10%
So what that is going to
look different for everybody.

00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It will.

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:47.490 align:middle line:84%
But aligning with our host
rather than against her

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:49.240 align:middle line:84%
is, I think, a good
start and place.

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>> IRON EYES: That's a
great place to start.

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Chase,
thank you so much,

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.030 align:middle line:84%
and I look forward to
another conversation--

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:54.390 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Yes.

00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:55.307 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --with you.

00:47:55.307 --> 00:47:56.790 align:middle line:90%
This was fun and enlightening.

00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>> IRON EYES: Thank you.

00:47:57.790 --> 00:48:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You can learn more
about Chase's work through his

00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:01.960 align:middle line:90%
website, sacreddefense.org.

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:04.590 align:middle line:84%
You can also sign up for
his newsletter regarding

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:07.780 align:middle line:84%
ongoing activist activity on
the pipeline and much more.

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Open Minds.
