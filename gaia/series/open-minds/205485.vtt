>>BELINDA WOMACK: So many human
beings are angels incognito.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.820 align:middle line:84%
As you learn to receive, you
help all of humanity to wake

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.880 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.770 align:middle line:90%
I had to learn this lesson.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.700 align:middle line:84%
If you have the ability
to love, let it grow.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.650 align:middle line:90%
Foster that ability.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.440 align:middle line:90%
It changes the world.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.420 align:middle line:90%
All you need to do is say--

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.773 align:middle line:90%

>>REGINA MERIDITH: Belinda
Womack and the Archangels

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.800 align:middle line:84%
are back with us to
speak about topics

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.390 align:middle line:90%
that are critical to our times.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Among them is the disparity of
resources among human beings.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.230 align:middle line:84%
This pushes about every
button for earthlings,

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.730 align:middle line:84%
no matter which side
of abundance we sit on.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.190 align:middle line:90%
So let's get into it.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.260 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Belinda.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.750 align:middle line:84%
It's always-- I said you look
like a sherbet ice cream cone.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:84%
You could just devour you,
you're so pretty in your pink.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.363 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, welcome back, Belinda.

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:05.530 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Thank you, Regina.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.760 align:middle line:10%
So let me just bring in
these 12 beautiful angels.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.440 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.400 align:middle line:84%
First of all, Regina, we
thank you for your willingness

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.830 align:middle line:90%
to bring up this subject.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.180 align:middle line:84%
We definitely believe
that there is a solution

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.360 align:middle line:90%
to disparity of resources.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And the solution may
be obvious to some.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.960 align:middle line:90%
It is a simple solution.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.230 align:middle line:84%
But what we offer is our 12
archangel and ascended master.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.320 align:middle line:84%
We can call on all of the
loving beings of heaven

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.930 align:middle line:84%
to give you our guarantee,
humanity, this works.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Lack of resources, at
its core, at its root,

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.230 align:middle line:84%
is because the feminine,
the divine feminine,

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.100 align:middle line:84%
has been pushed back
by the masculine,

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.900 align:middle line:84%
especially by the old
male paradigm of control,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.940 align:middle line:84%
by oppression, by certain
aspects of religion that

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.660 align:middle line:84%
take away the power of the
human being to receive.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.770 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to teach
humanity how to receive,

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.910 align:middle line:90%
because this is the solution.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.960 align:middle line:84%
We not only promise it, but we
say you will experience results

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.510 align:middle line:90%
immediately.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.010 align:middle line:84%
All you need to do is
say, with your intention,

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.410 align:middle line:84%
or to say these words,
"Thank you, divine feminine."

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.940 align:middle line:84%
The divine feminine is
part of your own soul.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.180 align:middle line:84%
The divine feminine is part of
source, mother, father, god,

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.150 align:middle line:90%
divine oneness, the universe.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.930 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, divine feminine,
divine mother, for receiving,

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.930 align:middle line:84%
through me, all that
I need and more.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth is called
Mother Earth for a reason.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Archangel Gaia is
feminine for a reason,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.710 align:middle line:84%
because the feminine
is out of balance.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.140 align:middle line:84%
But one more time we say
the solution is simple.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Humanity has forgotten
how to receive.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.900 align:middle line:84%
You may say, angels, what has
this got to do with disparity?

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.630 align:middle line:84%
When human beings do not know
how to receive from source,

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.630 align:middle line:84%
they either over give,
which is being actually

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.490 align:middle line:84%
in their masculine,
or they take,

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.580 align:middle line:84%
which comes from an
inability to receive.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.010 align:middle line:84%
If you are receiving
all that you

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.880 align:middle line:84%
need, whether it be fresh air
to breathe, food on your table,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:12.590 align:middle line:84%
your rent to be paid, clothes on
your back, the divine feminine,

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.459 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth is the
supplier of these resources.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Ask to receive in what you
need just by saying thank you.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And as you do this, those
that only know how to take,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:90%
they will begin to wake up.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they will, because
of divine oneness.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Every human being always
lives within oneness.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And because you, most
powerful human being,

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.240 align:middle line:84%
because you live within oneness,
as you learn to receive,

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.720 align:middle line:84%
you help all of humanity
to wake up, to stop taking,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.110 align:middle line:90%
to begin receiving.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And one more thing that
we feel we must say

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:17.720 align:middle line:84%
is that there is deception
around the financially

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.650 align:middle line:90%
profoundly wealthy.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.530 align:middle line:84%
You have been seeing
them as wealthy.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.880 align:middle line:84%
We see many of them
as incredibly poor,

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.820 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
know how to love.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.310 align:middle line:90%
They only know how to take.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And we say taking brings a
karma which means homework.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.390 align:middle line:84%
They are reaping
what they are sowing.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:84%
That means there is a cause
and effect for overtaking.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.710 align:middle line:90%
So as you receive--

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.170 align:middle line:84%
and you receive through
the divine feminine

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.080 align:middle line:90%
at the highest frequency--

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:06.830 align:middle line:84%
those who have been taking wake
up to their incredible poverty

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.740 align:middle line:84%
that they don't have love,
they don't have health,

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.110 align:middle line:90%
they don't have balance.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And they begin to
want what you have.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.674 align:middle line:90%
So receive.

00:06:21.674 --> 00:06:24.650 align:middle line:84%
Receive from source
and the universe

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.340 align:middle line:84%
and watch the
miracles, just watch.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.640 align:middle line:84%
We promise and we
keep our promises.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.290 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:39.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that was a
beautiful start to this subject

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.580 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of
information if people

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.320 align:middle line:90%
go back and listen again.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.120 align:middle line:84%
But I want to ask
further, you, Belinda,

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.370 align:middle line:84%
as a student of astrology
understand these.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And I want to know if
the Archangels will

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.090 align:middle line:90%
answer this question.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And that is here we
had the Age of Aries,

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.780 align:middle line:90%
which was very masculine.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.580 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.390 align:middle line:84%
It had a lot of strong
intellect and mental processes

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.280 align:middle line:90%
to it in the Age of Aries.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.080 align:middle line:90%
We moved into the Age of Pisces.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.310 align:middle line:84%
That was to have moved toward
the feminine, toward love.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And now we're moving into or not
that far away-- we're already

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.790 align:middle line:84%
on the precipice of moving
into the Age of Aquarius, which

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.440 align:middle line:84%
has a higher ideal
and higher thought.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.380 align:middle line:84%
But for a couple
thousand years, we simply

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.280 align:middle line:84%
bypassed the Age of
Love as it continued

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.730 align:middle line:84%
being dominated by the Age
of Aries and patriarchy,

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.790 align:middle line:84%
which led to the Industrial
Revolution and a lot

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:40.290 align:middle line:84%
of scientific breakthroughs,
but it quashed love

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.630 align:middle line:90%
as a primary principle.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Can you or the angels,
whoever is speaking to me now,

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:84%
speak about this a bit
and speak about what

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.865 align:middle line:84%
it means to now start moving
into the Age of Aquarius?

00:07:53.865 --> 00:07:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: I feel that the angels
can always do a better job.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.280 align:middle line:90%
So here they are.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.840 align:middle line:84%
What we say to you
is the Sign of Pisces

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:10.330 align:middle line:90%
is very much about suffering.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.420 align:middle line:84%
It's very much about
the unconscious that

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.740 align:middle line:84%
is moving around, and
controlling, and driving people

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.860 align:middle line:84%
through their
deepest motivations

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Pisces, as all signs in the
zodiac from our perspective,

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.570 align:middle line:90%
have different frequencies.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And we would say
that Pisces has a lot

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:41.919 align:middle line:84%
to do with religious suffering
and the false indoctrination

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:48.070 align:middle line:84%
that to be a loving human being,
you need to sacrifice yourself,

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.020 align:middle line:90%
you need to over give.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Receiving is not a
worthy thing to do.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Basically you are
supposed to be poor,

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.977 align:middle line:90%
and suffering, and miserable--

00:09:00.977 --> 00:09:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Worthless.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: --and worthless.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.570 align:middle line:90%
And worthless.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:09.100 align:middle line:84%
So the highest
vibration of Pisces

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:14.590 align:middle line:84%
is oneness, bringing
in the truth

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:19.360 align:middle line:84%
that human beings can
never leave divine oneness.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.720 align:middle line:84%
They cannot leave the
heart of the creator.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.950 align:middle line:90%
They can fall down in vibration.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:33.070 align:middle line:84%
But love is always working,
always pulling like a vacuum

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:40.750 align:middle line:84%
to lift humanity back
up to its divinity.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:47.920 align:middle line:84%
The energy of Aquarius is
very much about balancing

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:53.140 align:middle line:84%
higher vibrational thought,
which we call truth,

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.590 align:middle line:90%
with clear emotion.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Clear emotion means that the
guilt and the resentment,

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:06.970 align:middle line:84%
the unworthiness, the rage,
the hatred has been resolved.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.400 align:middle line:90%
It has been transformed.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.980 align:middle line:84%
So that the energy
of emotion, which

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.660 align:middle line:84%
again is the divine
feminine, is holding up

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.190 align:middle line:90%
the masculine of thought.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:22.810 align:middle line:84%
But now we talk about
the divine masculine.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And when that energy
is pure and clear,

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:35.980 align:middle line:84%
it is truth supported by the
human being's gut feeling.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.720 align:middle line:90%
This is truth.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.430 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle line:90%
It must be love.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Where does the
worthiness piece come in,

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.040 align:middle line:84%
moving out of the Piscean
Age, to just start

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.310 align:middle line:84%
knowing we're worthy of these
things we're starting to dream,

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:57.640 align:middle line:84%
so we actually take
action on them.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Again, our message
is push unworthiness aside.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.970 align:middle line:90%
It is a lie.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.780 align:middle line:84%
You are all divine
children of the creator.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.060 align:middle line:90%
You come from the central sun.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:16.740 align:middle line:84%
The central sun is
pure, undiluted love.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.490 align:middle line:84%
You come to school room
Earth to experience

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.070 align:middle line:90%
love that is the most diluted.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.170 align:middle line:90%
And this is fear.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.740 align:middle line:84%
You come here to
experience this fear.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And with fear comes
separation from source.

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:37.050 align:middle line:84%
You begin to believe
the lies of religion

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:42.180 align:middle line:84%
and of other philosophies
that tell you that you don't

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.640 align:middle line:90%
come from mother-father god.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.230 align:middle line:90%
You don't come from source.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.170 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, you
are so unworthy.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And you're guilty, so, so
guilty of crimes, and sins,

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and acts that you have no memory
of because you didn't even

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.230 align:middle line:90%
do them.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.040 align:middle line:90%
So we say push that aside.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Put it in the color purple, that
energy of your crown chakra.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:09.570 align:middle line:84%
That is always
there, that energy,

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:13.740 align:middle line:84%
to transform fear
back into love,

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.220 align:middle line:84%
and to help you to
ascend to the knowing,

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.970 align:middle line:84%
to the real knowing
in your molecules.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.640 align:middle line:90%
You are divine human being.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:31.200 align:middle line:84%
You can only be
worthy of receiving.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And as you embrace this
worthiness, guess what?

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.260 align:middle line:90%
You're going to stop taking--

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:42.030 align:middle line:84%
taking from your own self,
from your own reserves that

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:45.390 align:middle line:84%
have long been
emptied, and taking

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:49.380 align:middle line:84%
from others when that's the
last thing you want to do,

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.970 align:middle line:84%
and taking from your
beautiful Mother Earth

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.310 align:middle line:84%
because you don't
want to harm her.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.940 align:middle line:90%
You're going to stop taking.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:03.990 align:middle line:84%
This is the root
of unworthiness.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:12.150 align:middle line:84%
It has turned human beings into
fearful, so fearful, stealing

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:13.680 align:middle line:90%
children.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.890 align:middle line:84%
But we say this is not
who you really are.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.070 align:middle line:90%
You are divine beings.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And thank you
for that unworthiness

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:28.240 align:middle line:84%
and giving us a tool
to work with on that.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And another I've heard
you say in years past that

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.730 align:middle line:84%
is one of the
darkest human traits

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.620 align:middle line:84%
you just touched
on a moment ago.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.980 align:middle line:90%
And that is the guilt we carry.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: From our
perspective, guilt

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.800 align:middle line:84%
is the true devil
on schoolroom Earth

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:48.900 align:middle line:84%
because guilt will seduce
you into stepping away

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.520 align:middle line:84%
from what your heart is
asking you to do and to be.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:14:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Guilt is the slave
master that enslaves you

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:04.140 align:middle line:84%
to living lives that you
don't really want to live,

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.060 align:middle line:84%
being married to people
that you don't really

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.300 align:middle line:84%
want to be married to
or in relationship with,

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:14.860 align:middle line:84%
working at jobs that you don't
really want to be in that job.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:19.410 align:middle line:84%
They make you miserable
and take away your health.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:90%
This is what guilt does.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:27.060 align:middle line:84%
But if you remember, guilt
is just an offspring of fear.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:31.030 align:middle line:84%
You came into this
life with the ability,

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:34.470 align:middle line:84%
energetically, to
transform guilt

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.720 align:middle line:84%
and to transform the
fear that generates

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.520 align:middle line:84%
the guilt. Learn to love
the color purple and violet.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.810 align:middle line:84%
We say any shade works,
just be in it and say,

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:51.510 align:middle line:84%
I forgive it all, even if I
don't know what I'm forgiving.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness is one of the
most powerful, transformative

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.620 align:middle line:90%
qualities of love.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:04.605 align:middle line:90%
Love is the greatest power.

00:15:04.605 --> 00:15:06.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Indeed.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:10.950 align:middle line:84%
One thing you like to
talk to about and share

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:15.060 align:middle line:84%
is about the innate
interconnectedness between all

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:18.600 align:middle line:84%
of us and why it's so
important to be aware of that

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.740 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And I would like you to,
please, share on that.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to go
into the other realms.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be specific in
what I ask you about,

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.610 align:middle line:84%
but you say that
the other realms

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:30.990 align:middle line:90%
are right under our noses.

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:34.290 align:middle line:84%
There are so many different
beings and species

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:35.730 align:middle line:84%
that would love
to share with us,

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.850 align:middle line:84%
give us information, help
us with our creativity,

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:41.880 align:middle line:84%
give us energy, even
help with tasks.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:45.660 align:middle line:84%
We're surrounded by
lovely realms of helpmates

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.790 align:middle line:84%
and most of us, a,
don't know they're there

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:50.790 align:middle line:84%
and, b, don't know what to
do with them even if we did

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:52.090 align:middle line:90%
know they were there.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:57.010 align:middle line:84%
So if you can, please,
take it from there.

00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: So divine
oneness is the creator.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.650 align:middle line:90%
Divine oneness is source.

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:11.620 align:middle line:90%
Divine oneness is the universe.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Every particle of
God's energy of source

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:21.240 align:middle line:90%
is part of divine oneness.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:28.410 align:middle line:84%
If we take a human being,
the entire universe

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:33.160 align:middle line:84%
is within you through your
own particles of energy.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Your mitochondria
communicate with all beings

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:41.310 align:middle line:90%
of the universe at all time.

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Your gut biome is communicating
with the rest of divine oneness

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.450 align:middle line:90%
at all times.

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Your ego, which is your
personality, the expression--

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:03.090 align:middle line:84%
or you may even think of it as
the incarnation of your soul--

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:07.170 align:middle line:84%
is just too limited
to understand this.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And with this, we say take
your consciousness and hear us.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:19.020 align:middle line:84%
That through you, human
being, you have access

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:24.300 align:middle line:84%
to every other human being
that lives on schoolroom Earth,

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:30.940 align:middle line:84%
as well as every being
in the great universe.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And so when you want to help
the poor, or the disadvantaged,

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.820 align:middle line:84%
those who are suffering,
all we ask for you to do

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:47.010 align:middle line:84%
is to say where are you
within me suffering ones?

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Where are you within me angry
ones, powerless, helpless ones?

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.830 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Through the love within
me, I lift you up

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:07.720 align:middle line:84%
and energetically,
vibrationally I

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:13.150 align:middle line:84%
send you back to the central
sun to receive everything

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:17.680 align:middle line:84%
that you need, that you
desire, that will bring you

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:21.090 align:middle line:90%
true happiness.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:26.850 align:middle line:84%
If every human being, or even
a handful of human beings,

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:32.160 align:middle line:84%
would do this prayer, you
will see your schoolroom

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:40.140 align:middle line:84%
change radically,
positively, miraculously,

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.880 align:middle line:90%
so very, very quickly.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.830 align:middle line:84%
The power to transform
is within you.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Those suffering human beings,
they are not outside of you.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:58.620 align:middle line:84%
They are not outside
of divine oneness.

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.750 align:middle line:90%
They are within you.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.450 align:middle line:84%
So take your ego,
the only part of you

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:08.010 align:middle line:84%
that can believe that you are
separate from everyone else,

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:12.840 align:middle line:84%
bring it home to your heart
and say let's go find them,

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:18.030 align:middle line:84%
the lost ones, the
abused children.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Those suffering from sex
trafficking, and drug abuse,

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and addiction, and violence,
let's go find them.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's go find the
abandoned ones within self

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:40.920 align:middle line:84%
and lift them up with
love and send them home.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And yes, there are
angels everywhere

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:50.220 align:middle line:84%
to help support and hold
this vibration of oneness

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.620 align:middle line:90%
and healing.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.890 align:middle line:84%
You have heard us
say this before,

00:19:55.890 --> 00:20:01.380 align:middle line:84%
but your pets, well,
they are angels.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:05.190 align:middle line:90%
Elephants are seraphim angels.

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:07.560 align:middle line:90%
Dolphins are cherubim angels.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.360 align:middle line:84%
We're not giving
titles, we're just

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:14.760 align:middle line:84%
giving a little bit of
frequency, as Regina would say.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.300 align:middle line:84%
These great beings
have intelligence,

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:23.040 align:middle line:84%
shall we say access to
intelligence, far greater

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.570 align:middle line:84%
than most human beings choose
to use, not all human beings.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:32.790 align:middle line:90%
The trees are angelic beings.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:38.610 align:middle line:84%
There are fairy realms that
parallel with your reality.

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:42.570 align:middle line:84%
All over your planet,
there are vortexes

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:45.120 align:middle line:84%
that create portals
between heaven, which

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.790 align:middle line:90%
just means there is no fear.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Vortexes that are
creating doorways,

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:55.050 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] between
heaven and Earth everywhere.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:21:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And beings from all over the
universe, the great cosmos,

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:07.690 align:middle line:84%
are coming to your Earth to
help lift up consciousness

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:08.490 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.050 align:middle line:90%


00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.320 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:19.900 align:middle line:84%
We say to you, we are
part of divine oneness--

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:26.770 align:middle line:84%
every fairy, every gnome, every
tree spirit, every sea nymph.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And so we live within you
as you live within us.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:36.230 align:middle line:84%
You are never, ever alone,
even if you want to be.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And you can be sure
we are helping.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:44.480 align:middle line:10%
If you want to have direct
communication with us,

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.470 align:middle line:10%
just say thank you, tree
angels for carrying me,

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:53.240 align:middle line:10%
for lifting me, for
straightening my spine

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.820 align:middle line:10%
so that I can walk in truth.

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.070 align:middle line:90%
We are here.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Love all of them, and
particularly the tree angels.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And so this is kind of
a light-hearted question

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.652 align:middle line:84%
in that we have all of
these different groups.

00:22:08.652 --> 00:22:09.860 align:middle line:90%
And some of them are playful.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are
even mischievous.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:17.720 align:middle line:84%
So a couple questions,
what is the kind of point

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.150 align:middle line:84%
of playing within
the realms of sort

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:23.090 align:middle line:84%
of mischievous
little leprechauns,

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:27.080 align:middle line:84%
gnomes, and so forth that
might play a little games,

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.150 align:middle line:84%
or trick us, or take things
and hide them from us

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:31.070 align:middle line:90%
and bring them back?

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.920 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about those guys.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.160 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: So Regina, the
angels are asking me, Belinda,

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.230 align:middle line:90%
to answer this question.

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:39.635 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:39.635 --> 00:22:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: So I had
to learn this lesson

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I had fairies take jewelry
from me once upon a time.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.787 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: And it
completely disappeared.

00:22:48.787 --> 00:22:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And I knew it was right
there, but it was gone.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And I had to learn to value
the treasures within me

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:59.310 align:middle line:84%
and stop taking
them for granted.

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:02.602 align:middle line:84%
And the moment that that
thought came in my mind--

00:23:02.602 --> 00:23:03.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There it was.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.220 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: --there it was.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.080 align:middle line:90%
It reappeared.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:05.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I've done this too.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: So they're teachers.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:08.060 align:middle line:90%
They're teachers.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.400 align:middle line:84%
They're teaching us that
whatever disappears--

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.780 align:middle line:84%
so say it's gold coins, they're
saying where is your wealth?

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:16.070 align:middle line:90%
Look within.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:18.060 align:middle line:90%
How creative are you being?

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Are you doing the work
that your soul wants to do?

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.750 align:middle line:90%
Are you using that golden power?

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:26.915 align:middle line:84%
If you're using that, we'll
return your coins to you.

00:23:26.915 --> 00:23:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: [LAUGHING] I love it.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:31.490 align:middle line:84%
What about the notion that
some of the people walking

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:35.570 align:middle line:84%
the earth actually have been
in these rooms themselves?

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: So many human
beings are angels incognito.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.250 align:middle line:90%
Some are fairies.

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:44.360 align:middle line:90%
Some are gnomes.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Some are ascended masters,
which means teachers that

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:middle line:90%
are walking the earth again.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.660 align:middle line:90%


00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.340 align:middle line:90%
Everything is evolving.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.390 align:middle line:84%
The way the universe
works is it is always

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:05.540 align:middle line:84%
recycling so that consciousness
of oneness is evolving.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:11.610 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, those that
you meet that you say,

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:14.423 align:middle line:90%
wow, that human being--

00:24:14.423 --> 00:24:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They feel like
a little fairy to me.

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Exactly-- is so
loving, so incredibly loving.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.620 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's an angel.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.890 align:middle line:84%
That human being probably
is on a soul level.

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:30.250 align:middle line:84%
They still have their
lessons and challenges.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:34.655 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: But their soul
sings with the rest of us.

00:24:34.655 --> 00:24:36.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love it.

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Another thing I
was going to ask--

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:41.030 align:middle line:84%
and I can ask you or
I can ask the angels,

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.122 align:middle line:84%
and you guys decide
between you--

00:24:43.122 --> 00:24:45.080 align:middle line:84%
one thing I've always
been curious about, which

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.110 align:middle line:84%
is a hybrid creature somewhere
in between humans and sea

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:52.130 align:middle line:84%
nymphs, it's the whole
world of what were called

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:55.010 align:middle line:90%
mermaids and mermen, I guess.

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:57.970 align:middle line:90%


00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Do those beings, did
they exist physically?

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.010 align:middle line:90%
Do they exist physically?

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And what was their role as
compared to, for example,

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:11.048 align:middle line:84%
dolphins, which you
said are the cherubim?

00:25:11.048 --> 00:25:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And then I have a couple
of other questions, too.

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:13.810 align:middle line:90%
And I want to get into--

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:15.435 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get
let anyone get away

00:25:15.435 --> 00:25:17.740 align:middle line:84%
without the law of
attraction thing here.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.570 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:22.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: The merpeople
are very, very rar--

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:23.530 align:middle line:90%
real.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:26.720 align:middle line:90%


00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Forgive Belinda because
she was going to say they

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.220 align:middle line:84%
are rare now on your Earth,
but they are still here.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:37.070 align:middle line:84%
They know how to
avoid human eyes,

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:41.480 align:middle line:84%
but they are still
here in small numbers.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:45.560 align:middle line:84%
So you may say, oh, angels,
you have gone crackers.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.790 align:middle line:84%
There surely cannot be
merpeople on schoolroom Earth.

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:53.900 align:middle line:90%
And we say, well, listen to us.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Each and every human being
is dreaming their reality

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.400 align:middle line:90%
into being.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.950 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many
parallel realities.

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And some human beings
are creating nightmares,

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:10.970 align:middle line:84%
while some are honoring
the incredible richness

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:14.360 align:middle line:90%
and love of Lemuria.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:19.160 align:middle line:84%
So during this plane of
schoolroom Earth when

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:25.640 align:middle line:84%
fear was introduced,
yes, to be experienced,

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:31.790 align:middle line:90%
merpeople were everywhere.

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:33.500 align:middle line:90%
They were everywhere.

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And they have an
angelic quality.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.110 align:middle line:90%
They heal through sound.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:43.250 align:middle line:84%
They can transform
into a dolphin.

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:45.680 align:middle line:84%
They prefer being
seahorses, by the way.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.800 align:middle line:90%
They love that magical creature.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:52.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you've ever
seen a seahorse,

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:56.780 align:middle line:84%
it looks like a
being with a crown.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So they hold the vibration
of clear, pure feeling.

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Love that is expressed
through feeling, right?

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:14.240 align:middle line:90%
Like you feel it, you embody it.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:18.140 align:middle line:84%
They are very, very
important to the evolution

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:20.060 align:middle line:90%
of your schoolroom.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And what we invite
you to do is just--

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:27.140 align:middle line:84%
whenever you would like
is just to close your eyes

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.530 align:middle line:84%
and ask for your
own guardian angels

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:37.610 align:middle line:84%
to take you into the galaxies
where the merpeople thrive.

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:39.170 align:middle line:90%
They will welcome you.

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:41.510 align:middle line:90%
They know your language.

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:44.450 align:middle line:90%
They are here incognito.

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:46.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, beautiful.

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.230 align:middle line:90%
And what about the whales?

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: The whales are a
seraphim-cherubim fusion.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:58.700 align:middle line:84%
So seraphim-- this is
Archangel Michael--

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:01.880 align:middle line:90%
brings in pure, clear thought.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:07.160 align:middle line:84%
The cherubim bring in pure,
clear divine, mother emotion.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:12.560 align:middle line:84%
The whales are truly
teachers singing, harmonizing

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:17.510 align:middle line:84%
for all of humanity the
balance of the divine feminine

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:21.140 align:middle line:84%
with the divine
masculine so that there

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:27.110 align:middle line:90%
can be true unity and progress.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beautiful.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.360 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to talk to you
about the Law of One,

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:36.860 align:middle line:84%
because you've said
before that will--

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.570 align:middle line:84%
people think they
can use their will

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:42.380 align:middle line:84%
and will these
desires into reality.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:45.500 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying, no,
will is not enough.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
I've witnessed and watched

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:53.650 align:middle line:90%
people do for decades.

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of my
favorite topics,

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:59.320 align:middle line:84%
because I don't think people
understand, in general, what

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.780 align:middle line:90%
the actual law of attraction is.

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.730 align:middle line:84%
If you can talk about
that for a moment?

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: So we
would respectfully

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:11.620 align:middle line:84%
like to help your
listeners, your watchers,

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:17.260 align:middle line:84%
understand the Law of One and
how it works with the highest

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.100 align:middle line:90%
frequency Law of Attraction.

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: So the Law of
One is that we are all one.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And when one is
harmed, all are harmed.

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.100 align:middle line:84%
When one is helped,
all are helped.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Yet there was incredible love
put into this foundational law

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.500 align:middle line:90%
of schoolroom Earth.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.230 align:middle line:84%
You see, the "one"
referred to when

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:47.710 align:middle line:84%
one is harmed is referring
to all of divine oneness.

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Quantitatively, for the
purpose of this discussion,

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.770 align:middle line:84%
most of divine oneness
prefers the vibration

00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:58.600 align:middle line:90%
of undiluted love.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.040 align:middle line:90%
Meaning there is no fear.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.600 align:middle line:90%
So the majority rules.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:08.000 align:middle line:90%
All of one cannot be harmed.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.610 align:middle line:84%
So when one is harmed,
you may experience it

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:16.030 align:middle line:84%
but it is immediately
lifted up--

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:20.260 align:middle line:84%
even if on your Earth, it
seems like it takes lifetimes--

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:25.840 align:middle line:84%
because when one is
helped all are helped.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:32.170 align:middle line:84%
The Law of Attraction,
when you use this law--

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:37.310 align:middle line:84%
which simply means schoolroom
Earth works as a mirror--

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:41.830 align:middle line:84%
what is within you is
always without you.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:46.240 align:middle line:84%
Because it goes like
this-- as above, so below,

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.670 align:middle line:90%
heaven on Earth.

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:55.120 align:middle line:84%
As within, meaning within
your humanity, so without.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:31:00.550 align:middle line:84%
So if you bring in
more divine oneness,

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:05.950 align:middle line:84%
love, because you want to
help all concerned then

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:08.560 align:middle line:84%
what you can be
sure is that you are

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.290 align:middle line:84%
working with the
Law of Attraction

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:14.780 align:middle line:84%
at its highest vibration
or frequency of love.

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So you can only draw
to you more heaven,

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:24.760 align:middle line:84%
which means more healing, more
freedom, more prosperity, more

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.780 align:middle line:90%
opportunity.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:33.470 align:middle line:84%
This is the way that
your school was designed.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Now human will,
this is something

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:41.950 align:middle line:84%
that the ego gets to
play with and experience

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:44.440 align:middle line:90%
on schoolroom Earth.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:48.400 align:middle line:84%
What we are talking about
is the will of the ego.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And we say remember,
the ego, it is illusion,

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:56.200 align:middle line:84%
but it can believe
that it has the ability

00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.700 align:middle line:84%
to run away from soul and say,
I don't want to have anything

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.820 align:middle line:90%
to do with my divinity.

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.590 align:middle line:90%
I want to be a rascal.

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.510 align:middle line:90%
I want to go rogue.

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And then free will,
yes, that ego,

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:17.590 align:middle line:84%
gets to experience free will
and create some destruction.

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:23.410 align:middle line:84%
But we say the ego is
such a small part of you.

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And whenever the
soul chooses, it

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:30.940 align:middle line:84%
says, OK, rebel
child of mine, you

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.400 align:middle line:90%
have done enough destruction.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And it brings that
ego back home.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:43.090 align:middle line:84%
It will bring that ego back
home, because the Law of One

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:45.730 align:middle line:90%
is always working.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:49.870 align:middle line:84%
When the soul has
dominion over the ego,

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and it can say enough attracting
what only brings you misery.

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:02.908 align:middle line:84%
Let's rise up and bring in
something better to experience.

00:33:02.908 --> 00:33:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One thing
I've noticed when

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:07.420 align:middle line:84%
it comes to bringing in those
things that actually serve

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:11.080 align:middle line:84%
and feed us in our
lives is when the desire

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:15.010 align:middle line:84%
is coming from something
very real, like a desire

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:18.640 align:middle line:84%
to feel connected
with others, a desire

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.430 align:middle line:84%
to feel like your
work is meaningful,

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and to feel joy of, say,
connection with others,

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:27.550 align:middle line:84%
whatever that may
be, relationship.

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:30.730 align:middle line:84%
I notice that if you stay on the
feeling level rather than the

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:33.910 align:middle line:84%
to do list level,
the will level, which

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:37.630 align:middle line:84%
has images and expectations
associated with it,

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:39.655 align:middle line:84%
it just flows so
much more smoothly.

00:33:39.655 --> 00:33:43.710 align:middle line:90%


00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Because the feeling
is the essence of what

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.480 align:middle line:90%
you really want.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.105 align:middle line:84%
All those other
pictures and everything

00:33:48.105 --> 00:33:53.070 align:middle line:84%
pasted over it are surrogates
for the thing we seem to really

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:55.860 align:middle line:90%
be desiring most of the time.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Feeling is
fueled by the feminine.

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:02.070 align:middle line:90%
Feminine is emotion.

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:04.710 align:middle line:90%
Masculine is thought.

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:07.980 align:middle line:90%
Pure feminine is pure emotion.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:11.159 align:middle line:84%
And so when it comes
from feelings of love,

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:13.500 align:middle line:90%
meaning you're happy--

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.889 align:middle line:84%
and human beings, you
deserve to be happy--

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:22.290 align:middle line:84%
then feelings, which are
mental messages deciphering

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:27.060 align:middle line:84%
the emotion,
describing the emotion,

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:32.520 align:middle line:84%
then you have that pure
feminine and pure masculine.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:36.480 align:middle line:84%
So your will is at
the highest vibration.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.719 align:middle line:84%
We throw in some
gratitude, because it truly

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:43.679 align:middle line:84%
is the best attitude,
that gratitude for what

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:47.670 align:middle line:84%
makes you happy and
lifts you up, and feels

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:51.150 align:middle line:84%
so good, and so
true, and so right.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:55.949 align:middle line:84%
Then human beings,
you get to feel

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:59.790 align:middle line:90%
what we feel here in heaven.

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:02.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, that
makes so much sense.

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And I won't go into
it, but I've had

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:07.890 align:middle line:84%
a lot of personal
observation and experience

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:11.820 align:middle line:84%
with the whole notion of
staying with these deeper

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:15.990 align:middle line:84%
feelings of what
we're truly trying

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:19.380 align:middle line:84%
to feed back to ourselves
rather than thoughts.

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Mental thoughts don't ever seem
to get people to the same place

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.020 align:middle line:84%
that those deeper feelings of
desire on the deepest levels

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:26.820 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.320 align:middle line:90%
So I thank you for that.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to ask
you one more thing

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:33.030 align:middle line:84%
before we bring
Belinda back with us

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:38.010 align:middle line:84%
and that is you say that
your realm of beings,

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:41.250 align:middle line:84%
and archangels, and the
other realms surrounding us

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:42.750 align:middle line:90%
and watching us--

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:45.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure it's a hoot
to watch what we're

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.220 align:middle line:84%
up to, probably quite
painful, but you say

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.990 align:middle line:90%
you're not worried about us.

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:52.650 align:middle line:84%
You're not worried about where
we're ultimately going here.

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: Oh, we
see the progress

00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:04.480 align:middle line:84%
that divine oneness is making
through the human experience.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:10.350 align:middle line:84%
So is there great confusion
and incredible fear

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:12.450 align:middle line:90%
on schoolroom Earth?

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:14.760 align:middle line:90%
There is.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:21.480 align:middle line:84%
But more human beings are
choosing love than ever before.

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And love is the
greatest unifying force.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And it is the greatest
healing power.

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:37.590 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at what is
happening on schoolroom Earth,

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:45.300 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious of humanity has
been purging for a few decades.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And through that
purging, there is

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:51.180 align:middle line:90%
waking up and transformation.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we are delighted,
Regina, because there

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:59.700 align:middle line:84%
are more healers on Earth
than, well, let's say,

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:03.780 align:middle line:84%
than human beings have ever
admitted to being before.

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And so we find this
incredibly joyful.

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And so we say to you,
beautiful human beings,

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:20.100 align:middle line:90%
you are divine beings.

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And just understand
every soul that

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:27.300 align:middle line:84%
has expressed itself
through an ego,

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:30.180 align:middle line:84%
those souls are
anchored in love.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:35.700 align:middle line:84%
No matter how far
away the ego may seem,

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:40.590 align:middle line:84%
or egos may seem, that they have
fallen into fear, conspiracy

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:45.840 align:middle line:84%
theories, darkness,
and just paranoia,

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:49.350 align:middle line:90%
all the souls that are--

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:52.560 align:middle line:84%
they never leave the central
soul which is the central sun--

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.590 align:middle line:90%


00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:57.990 align:middle line:84%
all of those souls
have great awareness

00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:00.570 align:middle line:90%
as to what is happening.

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:05.400 align:middle line:84%
What we ask for you to do
is hold the prayer with us,

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:12.450 align:middle line:84%
thank you, thank you, thank you
that humanity is choosing love,

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:14.790 align:middle line:90%
more on the hour.

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:16.830 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:17.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And Belinda and I were
speaking privately.

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about the times.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.530 align:middle line:84%
We were talking
about the sadness

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:27.630 align:middle line:84%
that we've seen in
the United States,

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:30.600 align:middle line:84%
though it is not exclusive
to the United States.

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:33.270 align:middle line:84%
That these feelings
of resentment,

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:36.580 align:middle line:84%
and division, and racism
have come to the surface

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:40.080 align:middle line:84%
so we can see them now right
in plain day for what they are.

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And she shared something
really beautiful with me.

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Because what's happening is we
are becoming more integrated

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:50.460 align:middle line:84%
across the board and others
are hanging on to the old ways

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:52.470 align:middle line:84%
and not wanting to
see this happen.

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking about
the beautiful-- for example,

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.590 align:middle line:84%
in politics, and even some
of the media as well--

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:02.310 align:middle line:84%
but the beautiful
African-American people brought

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:06.330 align:middle line:84%
here against their will just
a few hundred years ago rising

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:08.340 align:middle line:90%
to positions of--

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't even want to say power--

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:12.930 align:middle line:84%
of responsibility,
articulate, beautiful,

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:16.020 align:middle line:84%
well-educated
humans that managed

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:20.640 align:middle line:84%
to get past this really
devastatingly difficult past

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.470 align:middle line:84%
and are now rising
to the surface

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and are representing us across
the board throughout industry,

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:28.470 align:middle line:84%
but also in our own government,
which I'm so happy to see.

00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And Belinda said to me that
she was shown at one point

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:37.020 align:middle line:84%
that when a Black woman, I
won't say African-American,

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:42.580 align:middle line:84%
but a woman who has black skin
or dark skin enters our dreams,

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:45.750 align:middle line:84%
it's showing us something
very specific and special now.

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:49.860 align:middle line:84%
If you could comment on that,
I would love to hear it.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: We taught this to
Belinda many years ago now.

00:39:56.250 --> 00:40:02.310 align:middle line:84%
You see, everyone in a dream
is actually part of you.

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And when a black woman
appears in a dream,

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.420 align:middle line:90%
she is the divine mother.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.700 align:middle line:90%
She is the earth mother.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:17.250 align:middle line:84%
So she is both heaven's
mother and earth's mother

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:24.940 align:middle line:84%
coming to you in a dream
to say, I am here for you.

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:28.560 align:middle line:90%
I am here for you.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And so we say embrace
this powerful mother who--

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:45.030 align:middle line:84%
really, her skin has
all of the colors,

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:48.060 align:middle line:84%
all of the women of your
planet, all of the people

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.740 align:middle line:90%
of your planet.

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:56.200 align:middle line:84%
Their skin is a reflection
of different shades

00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:00.660 align:middle line:90%
of Archangel Gaia's skin.

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:06.940 align:middle line:84%
If you look at her mountains,
if you look at her soils,

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:10.480 align:middle line:84%
if you look at her
rocks, you will

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:17.110 align:middle line:84%
see all of the shades
from the palest ivory

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:23.830 align:middle line:84%
to the deepest, deepest,
darkest chocolate.

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:29.130 align:middle line:84%
All shades of human skin,
your own divine mother

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and Mother Earth, these are
the colors of her own skin.

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:42.010 align:middle line:84%
When she holds all
of you, all of you,

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:49.390 align:middle line:84%
in her heart saying receive from
source, received from the sun.

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And you will no longer need
to take my oil and my gas.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:42:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And you will find that as
you receive, you feel better.

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And all of the pollution
issues and global warming,

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:08.860 align:middle line:90%
it all changes.

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And by all means, if I the
divine mother, divine feminine,

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:19.970 align:middle line:84%
appear to you in
a dream receive,

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:23.473 align:middle line:90%
beloved child, receive.

00:42:23.473 --> 00:42:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I love this.

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:25.190 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And I loved seeing it
exemplified in our skin

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:31.220 align:middle line:84%
as human beings and where
our species is going.

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:34.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm very, very happy
about this, very happy.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for sharing that
from the archangelic realm

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:41.480 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
deeper true meaning.

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.310 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely beautiful.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.980 align:middle line:84%
So Belinda, if
there's anything else

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.320 align:middle line:84%
that the archangels
would like to say,

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:49.820 align:middle line:84%
this would be a
good time to say it.

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:52.280 align:middle line:84%
If there's anything we've
left uncovered that we'd

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:56.470 align:middle line:84%
like to get through
today, if not,

00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:58.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you
a few personal things.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: All I hear
which is what I always

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.880 align:middle line:84%
hear is if you have the ability
to love, really celebrate

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:10.630 align:middle line:84%
that, really give gratitude
that you have that ability,

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:11.590 align:middle line:90%
and let it grow.

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:13.990 align:middle line:90%
Foster that ability.

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:19.187 align:middle line:84%
It changes the world
for all concerned.

00:43:19.187 --> 00:43:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Lots of powerful
words spoken today.

00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And you continue
on because you're

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:26.802 align:middle line:84%
working with the
archangels all the time

00:43:26.802 --> 00:43:28.510 align:middle line:84%
and you're working
with groups of people.

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:30.190 align:middle line:90%
And you have master classes.

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And what do they actually
do in those classes?

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.440 align:middle line:84%
What do the archangels and
you do in these master classes

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.720 align:middle line:90%
with the people that attend?

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WOMACK: So many,
many years ago,

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:42.640 align:middle line:84%
almost 30 years ago now,
when I was drafted by the 12

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:47.380 align:middle line:84%
archangels, I had a friend,
who also channeled, tell me

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:48.733 align:middle line:90%
you are the healers' healer.

00:43:48.733 --> 00:43:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what that meant.

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:52.900 align:middle line:84%
So through all these
years, I've observed

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:56.320 align:middle line:84%
that the people that come to
me to receive the messages

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.770 align:middle line:84%
from the angels and to receive
insight on why they are here,

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:00.910 align:middle line:90%
they're healers.

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:02.720 align:middle line:10%
They're artists.

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.870 align:middle line:10%
They are spiritual illuminators.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:07.960 align:middle line:10%
And so the angels created
their graduate program, which

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:09.790 align:middle line:10%
just means advanced training.

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:11.500 align:middle line:84%
And what I love
about that training

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:13.870 align:middle line:84%
is it's really about
training to teach

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:19.480 align:middle line:84%
you to love those unlovable
parts, to go deeper within.

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So the inner child,
the wounded child,

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.760 align:middle line:84%
divine child is really
at the foundation

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.330 align:middle line:90%
of all of their training.

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:27.145 align:middle line:90%
They go everywhere.

00:44:27.145 --> 00:44:28.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The little
Belinda, the little Regina.

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Absolutely.

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:31.750 align:middle line:90%
That's where they go.

00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:36.520 align:middle line:84%
So they teach-- because I'm
the messenger in the channel--

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:41.770 align:middle line:84%
but they teach how you
let the healer in you

00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:46.190 align:middle line:84%
rise up, and be seen, and
be heard, and be helpful.

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:46.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Great.

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:48.820 align:middle line:84%
We need all the help
we can get right now.

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:49.210 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Yeah.

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:50.485 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, healers unite.

00:44:50.485 --> 00:44:54.910 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] Belinda, thank you so
much as always for your time.

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And we never know
exactly what we're going

00:44:57.010 --> 00:44:59.830 align:middle line:90%
to expect because it's live.

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And each time though, I
find some really beautiful

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:05.380 align:middle line:90%
new truths coming through you.

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure the
people watching this

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:09.340 align:middle line:84%
have already stopped
it a few times

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:10.960 align:middle line:90%
to write some things down.

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:14.890 align:middle line:84%
And this whole
notion that as we are

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:18.640 align:middle line:84%
able to see the ones
that have, what we

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:22.390 align:middle line:84%
consider, the unlovable
conditions and issues as that

00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:24.670 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves and in ourselves.

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And it seems kind
of what, for me,

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:29.980 align:middle line:84%
what distilled out of it in
that part of the conversation

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:33.640 align:middle line:84%
was if we can go into a
state where we can feel

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.880 align:middle line:84%
that interconnectivity between
ourselves and everyone else,

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.080 align:middle line:90%
we're all in this.

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And then from that
place, go to the one

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:44.995 align:middle line:84%
who is damaged or hurt in some
way that we're identifying.

00:45:44.995 --> 00:45:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Yes.

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And then we can say--

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:51.280 align:middle line:84%
and because we've incarnated
so many times, most people,

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.180 align:middle line:84%
that we've had
these experiences.

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Exactly.

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We know
these damaged parts.

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:57.700 align:middle line:84%
We know the parts that
have stolen from another,

00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:59.470 align:middle line:90%
that have been raped or abused.

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:00.320 align:middle line:90%
It's already in us.

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:01.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Yes.

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's
part of our being.

00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:02.770 align:middle line:90%
So it shouldn't be that--

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:03.190 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Yes.

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not inaccessible.

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Yes.

00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To go in and
to say to this part,

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:12.040 align:middle line:84%
I send you back to the
central sun for healing now.

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:14.230 align:middle line:84%
That's very beautiful
and very direct.

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: It works.

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:17.047 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it works,
because you're already

00:46:17.047 --> 00:46:19.180 align:middle line:84%
doing it with the intention
you're all connected.

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:21.430 align:middle line:84%
So I really got that
one big time out of it.

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:22.970 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:27.190 align:middle line:84%
So as always, wonderful to
see your shiny, sherbert face

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:28.630 align:middle line:90%
and being.

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:31.600 align:middle line:84%
I thank you and I thank
the archangels for coming.

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.407 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see you
again before too long.

00:46:33.407 --> 00:46:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>>WOMACK: Thank you.

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you, Belinda.

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.990 align:middle line:84%
I love these
conversations, as always.

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Belinda also has ongoing
classes and group conversations

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:43.870 align:middle line:84%
with the angels in her master
class, as we just spoke about.
