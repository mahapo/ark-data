>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Once again, we

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.590 align:middle line:10%
have one of Gaia's very favorite
guests with us, Jerry Wills.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.610 align:middle line:10%
Aside from the incredible story
of Jerry's early start in life

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.900 align:middle line:10%
and healing abilities,
he has spent years

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.370 align:middle line:10%
researching some of the Earth's
anomalies, along with his wife

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.820 align:middle line:10%
Kathy, researcher
extraordinaire.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.770 align:middle line:84%
In today's show, we will look
at the American Southwest

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.000 align:middle line:84%
and treasure that was spirited
away more than 100 years ago

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.560 align:middle line:84%
by the Smithsonian and others,
never to be seen again.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.630 align:middle line:84%
That just ticks me off.
[LAUGHING] It still does.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.855 align:middle line:84%
I first learned about
that about 15 years ago,

00:00:58.855 --> 00:01:00.230 align:middle line:84%
and since then,
I've been wanting

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.240 align:middle line:84%
to talk to you about it,
because you spent a lot of years

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.240 align:middle line:84%
researching this particular
event, and Kathy.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.580 align:middle line:90%
She is your go-to research gal.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.760 align:middle line:90%
She's amazing.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.440 align:middle line:10%
>>JERRY WILLS: She's the person
who answers the questions when

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.430 align:middle line:10%
they're asked.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.120 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.880 align:middle line:10%
>>WILLS: Between
the two of us, we

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.170 align:middle line:10%
go places and look
into these things

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.400 align:middle line:10%
and try to come up with
tangible pieces of information

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.230 align:middle line:10%
so that we can present
it to other people.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's important,
because you put pieces

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.240 align:middle line:84%
together, you can connect
dots, you see things.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Kathy is going through the
archives, she is saying,

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.750 align:middle line:84%
eh, could be this, could be
that, that doesn't hold water;

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.180 align:middle line:84%
bingo, I think we
found something.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And you two are really
an extraordinary pair.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, and it's why
we created Xpeditions TV.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.550 align:middle line:84%
Because we felt that
if we could come across

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.130 align:middle line:84%
with information that is based
upon the details that we find

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.310 align:middle line:84%
and not necessarily just
based upon conjecture

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.307 align:middle line:84%
or some piece of information
that couldn't be validated--

00:02:05.307 --> 00:02:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, so
many people do that

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.570 align:middle line:84%
and get all excited with one
tiny little piece of evidence

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.340 align:middle line:84%
and then, throughout
history, build whole stories

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.250 align:middle line:84%
around one piece of
evidence that might even

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.630 align:middle line:90%
be subjective to begin with.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah, exactly.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so it discredits
a lot of these subjects.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, of
course we get excited

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.350 align:middle line:84%
when we come across a little
piece of information as well.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Of, course.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I mean, who wouldn't?

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But you still have
to go further to validate it.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: But, yeah.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's so much more.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Because each piece
leads to the next part.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And what Kathy has
done is nothing short

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.900 align:middle line:84%
of miraculous in piecing
together all of this.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.290 align:middle line:90%
She has figured things out.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what we're going
to talk about today,

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.040 align:middle line:84%
she researched archives
for nearly four years.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's every
day, hours every day,

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.580 align:middle line:84%
digging into places that most
people never think to dig

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.540 align:middle line:90%
and following leads.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.600 align:middle line:84%
This article relates
to that article,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.390 align:middle line:84%
and someone wrote
something back in the 1700s

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.090 align:middle line:90%
that here's an archive of it.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.430 align:middle line:90%
She'd read the whole thing.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And buried in there was a
little piece of information

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.800 align:middle line:84%
that led her to the next
thing she should look for.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.000 align:middle line:84%
But just to say this, too,
you guys are a total team,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.310 align:middle line:84%
but she's a little
on the shy side.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.970 align:middle line:84%
When we're all together off
camera, you'll be talking,

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.520 align:middle line:84%
and you're there,
and you're present,

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.460 align:middle line:84%
and you're the raconteur,
you're comfortable.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And Kathy will be
saying, don't forget

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.241 align:middle line:90%
about this that happened.

00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:35.290 align:middle line:90%
She'll kind of look away.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.860 align:middle line:84%
So she's a little
camera shy, so you're

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.130 align:middle line:84%
the spokesperson for both
of you in these endeavors.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, the information
I'm going to bring to you today

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.401 align:middle line:84%
I think is going
to be fascinating.

00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it's a story
I've been long fascinated with,

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.266 align:middle line:84%
but I don't have
a Kathy in my life

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:54.640 align:middle line:84%
to put the pieces
together, which

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.950 align:middle line:90%
is why I'm happy you're here.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.172 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Good.

00:03:57.172 --> 00:03:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's start
from the beginning,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.510 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking about
riches from past times

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.300 align:middle line:90%
that aren't known of exactly.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.190 align:middle line:84%
We don't-- we have a very rough
sketch of what the American

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Southwest is all about.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.970 align:middle line:84%
We think there were native
societies living there,

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.279 align:middle line:84%
everyone was peaceful,
buffalo was plentiful.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And then you had the
white man come across

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.060 align:middle line:84%
and do what they did,
and very disrespectfully

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.870 align:middle line:90%
so, and that's the end of story.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.100 align:middle line:90%
There's the West.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.600 align:middle line:84%
But there are layers and layers
of antiquities and history

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.290 align:middle line:84%
that go probably hundreds of
thousands, if not millions,

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.430 align:middle line:84%
of years prior to that
little, tiny story.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
dig into some that

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.440 align:middle line:84%
have to do with sophisticated,
modern-type treasure from very

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.640 align:middle line:90%
ancient times.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.980 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah, of course.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.140 align:middle line:84%
I think what we're going
to be talking about,

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle line:84%
so your viewers will
understand, of course,

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.931 align:middle line:84%
is this mythological story of a
lost city in the Grand Canyon.

00:04:57.931 --> 00:04:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And its booty.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.310 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: And its booty.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And how for decades, many
decades, perhaps even up

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:11.000 align:middle line:84%
to 100 years, it was considered
to be just a tall tale, kind

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.740 align:middle line:84%
of like an April
Fool's Day joke,

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.680 align:middle line:90%
that was put into the newspaper.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And no one past a
point really gave it

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.090 align:middle line:84%
any thought as being a real
thing, because after all, there

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.910 align:middle line:90%
was one story.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.830 align:middle line:90%
That's the all and end of it.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, we had come
across this story.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.825 align:middle line:84%
And Kathy said, we need to find
out if this is real or not.

00:05:39.825 --> 00:05:41.415 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why?

00:05:41.415 --> 00:05:44.080 align:middle line:84%
She said, well,
because if it's real,

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.250 align:middle line:90%
it leads to something else.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.600 align:middle line:84%
She says, look
what I found here.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.950 align:middle line:84%
So I took at look, and
what she had discovered

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.030 align:middle line:84%
was in an ancient
manuscript-- she had already

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.970 align:middle line:90%
started researching this.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.980 align:middle line:84%
She'd found an
ancient manuscript

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.850 align:middle line:84%
from Asia that talked about
a pilgrimage that was taking

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.280 align:middle line:90%
place for many, many years.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't know for how many.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.320 align:middle line:84%
But they were coming
from Asia, and they

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.230 align:middle line:84%
were going to a place
called the Canyon of Light

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.515 align:middle line:90%
to see the Child of the Sun.

00:06:14.515 --> 00:06:18.340 align:middle line:90%
She said, what if it's this?

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's intriguing,
because I didn't even

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.560 align:middle line:84%
give a thought to people
from Asia making a trip

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.280 align:middle line:84%
to someplace call the
Canyon of Light that

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.752 align:middle line:90%
would be across the ocean.

00:06:28.752 --> 00:06:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And it wouldn't be
until many years later

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.590 align:middle line:84%
we actually found evidence
that this was indeed

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.970 align:middle line:90%
what was happening.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, as she started
digging into this research,

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.850 align:middle line:84%
she discovered that there
was a newspaper article that

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.210 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to
relate to the story

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.730 align:middle line:90%
that everyone was familiar with.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.410 align:middle line:90%
The 1909 one from "The Gazette."

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that
story says that they're

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.090 align:middle line:84%
basically picking it
up from the last thing

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.210 align:middle line:90%
that they reported on.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.150 align:middle line:84%
I forgot exactly how
they phrased this,

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.350 align:middle line:84%
but she says there's going to be
this other-- if this is real--

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's
another report.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: So she started looking.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Eventually she found
her way into archives,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.020 align:middle line:84%
and there were no references
in any of the archives

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.560 align:middle line:90%
she looked in.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.430 align:middle line:84%
It's as though that was never
printed, it was never done,

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.220 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't make any sense.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.880 align:middle line:90%
Why would they say this?

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.210 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't be for another year
and a half, maybe two years,

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:38.120 align:middle line:84%
that she discovered that there
was a private collection,

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.980 align:middle line:84%
and in the private collection,
this was in that archive.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.230 align:middle line:84%
But it had been taken out
of all the other archives.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: This article.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: This one article.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:48.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.430 align:middle line:84%
It is just one from
the "Yuma Gazette?"

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the one
that we read later

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.020 align:middle line:90%
was from the Phoenix paper.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Right.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, OK.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.860 align:middle line:84%
So this the "Yuma
Gazette" preceded it.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: So that was startling.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.060 align:middle line:84%
How do you explain that,
that all the public archives,

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.350 align:middle line:90%
this article is not in it?

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.360 align:middle line:84%
But only one existing
archive it was in.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.190 align:middle line:90%
So we made a photocopy of it.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And we had been
telling people what

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:84%
we were doing, keeping them
up to date, as we always

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.520 align:middle line:90%
do with Xpeditions TV.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And we put it up
on the internet.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.350 align:middle line:90%
Here you go, folks.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Here's the missing piece that
everyone said didn't exist.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The first report of
the discovery of this bounty.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Mhm.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:41.679 align:middle line:84%
And what that first report
said was intriguing,

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:45.830 align:middle line:84%
because it refers to
this fellow, GC Kincaid.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.290 align:middle line:84%
He had emerged from the Grand
Canyon, come down the Colorado

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:53.050 align:middle line:90%
River, exited at Yuma.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And he had thousands,
hundreds or thousands--

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't recall now--
but a great number

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.830 align:middle line:84%
of photographic plates of
what he had taken pictures of.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And he was having this
one agency there in Yuma

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.090 align:middle line:90%
process all the photography.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:13.410 align:middle line:84%
He had been using the latest
state-of-the-art Kodak camera.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
an expedition was

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.920 align:middle line:84%
being formed to go
back because he'd

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.710 align:middle line:84%
found a lost city
in the Grand Canyon

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.620 align:middle line:84%
that was suspected
as being Egyptian.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Now that's where everyone else
has picked up on that story.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, he was not just
a random adventurer.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.400 align:middle line:90%
He was the son of a Mason.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.030 align:middle line:90%
He was well-equipped.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.932 align:middle line:84%
He was monied for
this adventure.

00:09:40.932 --> 00:09:42.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And that's
where it starts

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.086 align:middle line:90%
getting quite intriguing.

00:09:45.086 --> 00:09:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Why was GC Kincaid in there
with a bunch of cameras?

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And how would he know
where to go and look?

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is not
an accessible area.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, we've been the
Grand Canyon many times looking

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.646 align:middle line:84%
for is place over the
course of almost four years.

00:10:03.646 --> 00:10:05.146 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you
that this is some

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:07.920 align:middle line:84%
of the most dangerous,
treacherous terrain you've ever

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.720 align:middle line:90%
seen.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, we started
asking these questions.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:15.750 align:middle line:90%
Kathy asked them.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.360 align:middle line:90%


00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.050 align:middle line:84%
So she says, I've got to
find out who Kincaid is.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.122 align:middle line:84%
Found out that he's
from Idaho, and he

00:10:25.122 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:84%
was one of the best known, most
talented trackers, explorers,

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:35.810 align:middle line:84%
hunters, survivalists
of that age.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.860 align:middle line:90%
But why was he picked?

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, how did they
even know about him?

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, she found that
information as well.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.040 align:middle line:84%
As it turns out,
there's a fellow

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.490 align:middle line:90%
named John Wesley Powell.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And Powell had gone into the
Grand Canyon ahead of Kincaid.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Powell had lost one of
his arms in the Civil War.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.390 align:middle line:90%
And he was now-- what was he?

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.934 align:middle line:84%
She could tell you--
something with the Interior.

00:11:07.934 --> 00:11:09.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: With the
Department of the Interior?

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Right.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think he was the
person in charge of that.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, he had gone
into the Grand Canyon

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:84%
very specifically, taking
his time, going through.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And in his journal,
it talks about how

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.925 align:middle line:84%
he had be rescued off
of cliffs because he

00:11:25.925 --> 00:11:27.700 align:middle line:90%
was climbing way up on cliffs.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, if
he's missing an arm--

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.220 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: With one arm.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How is that possible?

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:32.700 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It was like he
was looking for something.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.930 align:middle line:84%
But they never figured out
what he was looking for.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:36.875 align:middle line:84%
And he eventually
exited the Grand Canyon,

00:11:36.875 --> 00:11:39.160 align:middle line:90%
and that's the end of that.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Then here you have
Kincaid coming down, going

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:48.270 align:middle line:84%
to the same places Powell
went, and he found something.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.590 align:middle line:84%
So then you have
to ask yourself,

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:53.880 align:middle line:84%
why was Powell there
looking for something?

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Because it was really clear that
he was looking for something.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now that
gets into the back story

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.700 align:middle line:84%
of why the search, why
the journey westward

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.140 align:middle line:84%
to begin with to
this fable of riches.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Exactly.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.395 align:middle line:84%
And this is where she uncovered
just an amazing wealth

00:12:11.395 --> 00:12:12.195 align:middle line:90%
of detail.

00:12:12.195 --> 00:12:14.730 align:middle line:90%


00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:19.680 align:middle line:90%
It takes us back into Europe.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And in Europe, you have
kings and nobility,

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:30.810 align:middle line:84%
sometimes very rich people
who share some kind of title.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:33.394 align:middle line:84%
But these are
well-educated people.

00:12:33.394 --> 00:12:34.810 align:middle line:84%
They are taught
to read and write.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:35.900 align:middle line:90%
They went to universities.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.660 align:middle line:90%
They were taught.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.830 align:middle line:84%
But by and large, most
of the common people

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.610 align:middle line:84%
didn't know how
to read or write.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:47.720 align:middle line:84%
They basically were a workforce,
surviving as best they could.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.570 align:middle line:84%
But the nobility had access to
things that were passed down

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.160 align:middle line:90%
generation to generation.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.535 align:middle line:84%
If there were wars, whoever
conquered got their information

00:12:57.535 --> 00:13:00.670 align:middle line:90%
and made it their own.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, some
of this information

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.470 align:middle line:84%
fell into the hands
of England and Spain

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and France, too,
I would presume.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and they
have their own lineages

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.770 align:middle line:84%
that had protected Masonic,
Templar, and other,

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.030 align:middle line:90%
more ancient knowledge.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Sure.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you
remember the Templars.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.400 align:middle line:90%
They were in France.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And they escaped out
of there and went

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.590 align:middle line:90%
to England and other places.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:25.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Portugal.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And then they
amassed an amazing amount

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.680 align:middle line:90%
of information.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.530 align:middle line:84%
This information wasn't
just your ordinary type.

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:36.790 align:middle line:84%
It dealt with a world
that was totally

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:41.760 align:middle line:84%
a different world than anything
that we've ever known existed.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.540 align:middle line:84%
There were maps
and other documents

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:48.030 align:middle line:84%
that supported that
somewhere else on the face

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.550 align:middle line:84%
the Earth there was a
civilization in another part

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:55.020 align:middle line:84%
of the world that was vast
and advanced and very capable.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.580 align:middle line:90%


00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:03.320 align:middle line:84%
So take it a little bit
farther now in time,

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.890 align:middle line:84%
and you have Spain
coming over here.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.340 align:middle line:90%
And what is Spain doing?

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.880 align:middle line:84%
They're going, looking for
gold, looking for treasure.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.100 align:middle line:84%
They're going all over
the Southwest trying

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.260 align:middle line:90%
to find something.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.450 align:middle line:90%
They never found it.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.200 align:middle line:84%
They found bits and
pieces, but they never

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.620 align:middle line:84%
found what they
were looking for.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.257 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.257 --> 00:14:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Bring us a little
bit farther forward,

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:31.280 align:middle line:84%
the Americas occur, and
you have England at war

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.940 align:middle line:84%
with the Americas for
the Revolutionary War.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the War of 1812

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.890 align:middle line:84%
and all of these
things taking place.

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:43.660 align:middle line:84%
There were pieces of history
that occurred during that time

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.190 align:middle line:90%
that we're not really aware of.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:46.660 align:middle line:90%
Some people are.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some your viewers are
aware of it, but by and large,

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:51.670 align:middle line:90%
most people aren't.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:55.760 align:middle line:84%
For example, the War
of 1812, what we found

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.496 align:middle line:84%
is that the United States
lost that war to England.

00:14:59.496 --> 00:15:02.560 align:middle line:90%
It was bankrupt.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.050 align:middle line:90%
The White House is burned down.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:08.840 align:middle line:84%
That's part of public
knowledge, historical knowledge.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.680 align:middle line:84%
But what happened
next maybe isn't.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And that is because England
came and said, look,

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.350 align:middle line:90%
we don't want to ruin you guys.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:22.840 align:middle line:84%
How about if we give you a bunch
of money, get started again.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.950 align:middle line:90%
There are things we need.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:29.240 align:middle line:84%
England was at war with everyone
all over the face the world,

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.480 align:middle line:90%
and they needed supplies.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.280 align:middle line:90%
They needed--

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.196 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A workforce.

00:15:33.196 --> 00:15:34.990 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: A workforce.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:35.920 align:middle line:90%
The Americas had that.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: For goods, mhm.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: They had the people in
the South, people in the North,

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.160 align:middle line:90%
all this stuff going on.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We were a
very industrious country

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.170 align:middle line:90%
in the early years.

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:46.940 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah, we were.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.260 align:middle line:84%
So they said, we'll
give you a loan,

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.410 align:middle line:84%
get yourself back
on your feed again,

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:56.020 align:middle line:84%
and you can pay
us back the loan.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:01.070 align:middle line:84%
But they made things such that
it could never be paid back.

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, take us a little bit
farther forward in time.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.790 align:middle line:84%
What you have now is you
have the South and the North.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And the South is going, hey,
we're supplying all these goods

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:16.310 align:middle line:90%
to the North.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:17.970 align:middle line:84%
We're getting pennies
on the dollar.

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:21.116 align:middle line:84%
They're selling it to
England for a lot more

00:16:21.116 --> 00:16:21.990 align:middle line:90%
than we were getting.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Why is it, when we could be
making these things as well?

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:28.140 align:middle line:90%
Why is this happening?

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.970 align:middle line:84%
They didn't understand that
there was an agreement made,

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:33.320 align:middle line:90%
and they had to do that.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.080 align:middle line:84%
For all they knew, they
were just basically being

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.070 align:middle line:90%
taken advantage of.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:42.135 align:middle line:84%
So they said, look,
we don't like this.

00:16:42.135 --> 00:16:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
there was slavery,

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and there were people on both
sides of the fence with that.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.870 align:middle line:84%
So England says,
you know something?

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.815 align:middle line:84%
Because they're starting
to think, hm, maybe

00:16:52.815 --> 00:16:55.140 align:middle line:90%
we should have kept this place.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.650 align:middle line:90%
They said, you know something?

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:59.980 align:middle line:84%
You really shouldn't be
taking that from them.

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.510 align:middle line:84%
What you should be doing
is doing it yourself

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.079 align:middle line:90%
and selling it directly to us.

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:07.940 align:middle line:84%
They're selling us guns and
cannons and gun powder and all

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.290 align:middle line:84%
this stuff, and you could
be doing the textiles.

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.967 align:middle line:90%
You're really set up for it.

00:17:12.967 --> 00:17:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And they're going, yeah,
that's a good idea.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.310 align:middle line:90%
But we don't have enough money.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.670 align:middle line:90%
We want to secede.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And they're going,
well, then you should.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.057 align:middle line:90%
Change is good.

00:17:23.057 --> 00:17:25.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm sure there was a
little more dialogue than that,

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.550 align:middle line:84%
but thank you for
reducing it for us.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:29.752 align:middle line:90%
Of course, change is good.

00:17:29.752 --> 00:17:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And they go,
well, you're right.

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.420 align:middle line:90%
Change is good.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.760 align:middle line:90%
So let's secede.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.810 align:middle line:84%
So they all get together
and talk about it.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:40.520 align:middle line:90%
Everybody says, grand idea.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
all quite wealthy.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.674 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they have
big plantations.

00:17:43.674 --> 00:17:44.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not that they're broke.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.660 align:middle line:84%
But they could be a lot
more wealthy if they were

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:47.909 align:middle line:90%
controlling their own destiny.

00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:50.450 align:middle line:90%
So let's make our own country.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:56.130 align:middle line:84%
They go and try to do this,
make the announcement,

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.790 align:middle line:84%
and just before they make the
announcement, England says,

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:03.090 align:middle line:84%
look, we want to make sure
that you guys are going to win,

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:04.900 align:middle line:90%
and it'll be just fine.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Let's put this big chunk of
money in the Bank of Virginia.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And that way, you've got
some operating capital.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:15.720 align:middle line:90%
So they did.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And the South is
going, that's good.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.800 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's go, boys.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.740 align:middle line:90%
Let's go, y'all.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:90%
And they announced it.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.140 align:middle line:90%
They're going to secede.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.780 align:middle line:90%
There's going to be a war.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And all this is coming
into a very fine point,

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.740 align:middle line:90%
and it isn't good.

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And as things get to that
critical moment where there's

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.320 align:middle line:84%
no turning back, it's going to
happen, it's a matter of God,

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.010 align:middle line:84%
country, and honor, England
goes to the Bank of Virginia

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:48.570 align:middle line:84%
and promptly takes all
their money out and says,

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:90%
eh, we changed our mind.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:57.912 align:middle line:84%
And the South is like,
oh, that's not good.

00:18:57.912 --> 00:19:00.230 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
use all of our own money.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's still do it.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And it ends up rather
disaster-oriented.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:14.190 align:middle line:84%
It was is a very bad thing
that happened to this country.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the end of the
Civil War-- because you see,

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:24.014 align:middle line:84%
Lincoln already knew
this was going on.

00:19:24.014 --> 00:19:25.055 align:middle line:90%
He knew it was happening.

00:19:25.055 --> 00:19:27.660 align:middle line:90%


00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.909 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, we can't let
them burn down-- because England

00:19:30.909 --> 00:19:31.950 align:middle line:90%
is going to come in here.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:34.170 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be bad
trouble for all this.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.280 align:middle line:84%
We can't let them destroy
the White House again.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.910 align:middle line:84%
The seat of power
can't be overwhelmed.

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.040 align:middle line:90%
It's right here on the ocean.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:47.280 align:middle line:84%
England has got this massive,
ocean-going warship force.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Let's move the capital
someplace else.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Let's move it to where
the seat of power

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.515 align:middle line:84%
was for those who originally
were in the Americas.

00:19:56.515 --> 00:19:59.230 align:middle line:90%


00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Well the backstory
that's happening here,

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:06.040 align:middle line:84%
if you can follow this, is
that while all this is going on

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.370 align:middle line:84%
with the Civil War, there's
some guys over in the Arizona

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:12.530 align:middle line:90%
Territory.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want any
part of all that stuff.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.570 align:middle line:84%
They're too far away
from it for it to matter.

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:23.200 align:middle line:84%
They're busy being
ranchers and whatever

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.530 align:middle line:90%
they were, prospectors.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And they find in this
Paiute Indian settlement,

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:39.777 align:middle line:84%
this woman had been
attacked by a cougar.

00:20:39.777 --> 00:20:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
had some medicine.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.439 align:middle line:90%
They knew what to do.

00:20:42.439 --> 00:20:44.730 align:middle line:84%
They'd been surviving the
wilderness for all this time.

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:46.570 align:middle line:90%
And so they saved her life.

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Turns out to be the
wife of the chief.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And the chief is like,
you guys are pretty nice.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.110 align:middle line:90%
I like what you've done.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Don't like white men.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:58.400 align:middle line:90%
So I'll tell you what.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.941 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you a
bunch of gold since I

00:20:59.941 --> 00:21:02.150 align:middle line:90%
know you're looking for it.

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And take as much as you can
carry, but don't come back.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.004 align:middle line:90%
We'll kill you.

00:21:06.004 --> 00:21:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because their culture
had really very little use

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:10.600 align:middle line:84%
for it other than to
bargain for something.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.990 align:middle line:90%
They were living on the land.

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Right.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.601 align:middle line:84%
Well, in their philosophy this
was in the city of the dead.

00:21:15.601 --> 00:21:16.850 align:middle line:90%
They're not gonna go in there.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.045 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: The cave
is right there.

00:21:19.045 --> 00:21:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Go in and get some stuff and
leave, but don't come back.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.950 align:middle line:90%
Well, they did.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.050 align:middle line:84%
All this is going on
on the East coast,

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:29.940 align:middle line:84%
and these guys are over here
in the Arizona territories,

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.830 align:middle line:90%
kind of the western side.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:35.500 align:middle line:84%
They show up in Salt Lake City
with these magnificent pieces

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.940 align:middle line:90%
of gold, these artifacts.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it gets
telegraphed back to Washington,

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.750 align:middle line:84%
because there's this thing
they're wanting to find out.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:49.750 align:middle line:84%
If anybody comes up
with stuff like this,

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:51.910 align:middle line:90%
we need to know about it.

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:54.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because are
trying to essentially boost

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:55.880 align:middle line:90%
their treasury.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: That, and they're also
privy to the information that

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.480 align:middle line:90%
they were able to get--

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.555 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: From their own
bloodlines or whatnot,

00:22:04.555 --> 00:22:06.480 align:middle line:90%
that there was something here.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Right, and if you find
it, you're king of the world.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:15.760 align:middle line:90%
So telegraph, the message goes.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.270 align:middle line:84%
These guys brought
in these things,

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.770 align:middle line:84%
never seen anything
like it before.

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Next thing you know, all this
is going on with the war.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:31.241 align:middle line:84%
War shuts down, and John
Wesley Powell shows up.

00:22:31.241 --> 00:22:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about
the Golden Capstone Project

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:34.950 align:middle line:90%
and where that fit in.

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, at the
end of the Civil War,

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Lincoln is thinking to
himself, this isn't good.

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Because he's now said that
he's going to break away

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:51.070 align:middle line:84%
from House of McGregor,
which are the Masons,

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:55.840 align:middle line:84%
form his own Masonic
order in the Americans.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.830 align:middle line:84%
That didn't go over very well
with anybody, except the people

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.410 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And to make it
even more powerful,

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.820 align:middle line:84%
he's moving the capital over
somewhere in the Southwest.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.250 align:middle line:84%
It really wasn't that
clear, as I recall.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:12.700 align:middle line:90%
Kathy found these documents.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:13.910 align:middle line:90%
It's not just conjecture.

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:16.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:21.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: The next thing you
know, it's called the Golden

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.280 align:middle line:90%
Capstone Project.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.967 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Capstone, of course
important in the Masonic order.

00:23:26.967 --> 00:23:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And of course,
as everyone knows, as soon

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:33.310 align:middle line:84%
as Lincoln signs this order,
we know that happened,

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:36.420 align:middle line:84%
but everyone knows that
Lincoln was assassinated.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.145 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What was
the proximity in time?

00:23:38.145 --> 00:23:41.067 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh, within days.

00:23:41.067 --> 00:23:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He signs the
order, and he's dead.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:43.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So it all went
down very, very rapidly.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And of course, everyone
has their own idea

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:50.920 align:middle line:90%
why he was assassinated.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.600 align:middle line:84%
It could be this,
that, or the other.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:54.810 align:middle line:90%
We don't know why it happened.

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:59.120 align:middle line:84%
But we know that these
events took place.

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:04.110 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they were
going in and taking a look.

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:05.990 align:middle line:84%
John Wesley Powell
is going and looking

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:09.100 align:middle line:84%
because these two
brothers reported

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:12.130 align:middle line:84%
where they got it
from in general terms,

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:14.510 align:middle line:90%
because he went and found them.

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And they told him, and
so they're going back,

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:22.500 align:middle line:84%
and Wesley Powell is going
back to look for this location.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.630 align:middle line:90%
He can't get to it.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:32.230 align:middle line:84%
So he finds someone else, and
that's how GC Kincaid shows up.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so he has
discovered this place.

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:38.790 align:middle line:90%
How did he get access to it?

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Because this is almost a
couple thousand-foot drop-off

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:46.200 align:middle line:84%
with an opening
that would seem, I

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.869 align:middle line:84%
mean, even with
repelling-- I guess

00:24:47.869 --> 00:24:49.410 align:middle line:84%
with the most
sophisticated repelling

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:52.010 align:middle line:84%
gear you could get in, but
you can't get anything out

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:52.820 align:middle line:90%
of there.

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.594 align:middle line:90%
So how did that happen.

00:24:54.594 --> 00:24:56.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well,
let's take a moment

00:24:56.010 --> 00:25:00.670 align:middle line:84%
and examine what this place
was before it changed.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:04.220 align:middle line:84%
What we have here is
a place in the canyon

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.680 align:middle line:90%
called [? Quagid ?] Falls.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.530 align:middle line:84%
It at one time had been
a dam, a natural dam.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Two volcanoes went off and
filled in the Grand Canyon,

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:17.960 align:middle line:90%
creating a natural dam.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.095 align:middle line:84%
This, in turn, caused
a big lake, kind

00:25:21.095 --> 00:25:23.460 align:middle line:90%
of like Lake Powell is now.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And these people
who were in there,

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:29.210 align:middle line:84%
we don't know when
they went there.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:30.670 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
that story is.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:34.400 align:middle line:84%
All we know is that there were
Asians coming across, going up

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.340 align:middle line:84%
the Colorado River,
getting to his dam,

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:40.110 align:middle line:84%
climbing up, getting into
boats, and going across

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:44.960 align:middle line:84%
to the entrance of
this underground city.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And they called it
the City of Light.

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:52.650 align:middle line:84%
They were going there to pay
homage to the child of the sun.

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:54.780 align:middle line:84%
We don't know who that
is, what that means.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.320 align:middle line:90%


00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.580 align:middle line:84%
So we have those
events going on,

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.070 align:middle line:84%
and now you have Powell and
Kincaid having gone there

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:06.320 align:middle line:90%
two different times in history.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.380 align:middle line:90%
And this dam has broken.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.090 align:middle line:90%
That's the key part.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:14.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So the water level
is not at 1,800 feet high.

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, can I
insert a story here?

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:18.210 align:middle line:90%
Don't forget where you are.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:19.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
if I'm supposed

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.930 align:middle line:90%
to be talking about it.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:23.542 align:middle line:84%
It was a documentary I was
going to do 10 years ago.

00:26:23.542 --> 00:26:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I won't tell anyone.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:25.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank you.

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.260 align:middle line:90%
Sh.

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.874 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Quiet.

00:26:27.874 --> 00:26:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And I won't get
into details just in case,

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:33.670 align:middle line:90%
but-- well, a little bit.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:36.240 align:middle line:84%
It was called "The Mystery
of the Cliff Dwellers,"

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.880 align:middle line:84%
That's what the documentary
for PBS would have been.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:45.460 align:middle line:84%
A man who work for NASA and had
access to all satellite imagery

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:48.772 align:middle line:84%
and was an extreme climber
and spelunker and such

00:26:48.772 --> 00:26:52.170 align:middle line:84%
in the Southwest as
well made a discovery.

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And the only question
was the timing on it.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:00.580 align:middle line:84%
That was all a vast, inland
sea, as little as 800 years ago.

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.462 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Oh, he found
evidence of this.

00:27:03.462 --> 00:27:04.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there
was a fracture,

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.960 align:middle line:84%
which created what became the
fracture down the Grand Canyon.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:09.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Exactly.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:15.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so he was saying,
these cliff dwellings, Chaco

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:16.875 align:middle line:84%
Canyon, all these
different mysteries

00:27:16.875 --> 00:27:19.250 align:middle line:84%
are easily solved when you
realize that was just a launch

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:21.442 align:middle line:84%
point for boats, or
that was a launch point

00:27:21.442 --> 00:27:23.400 align:middle line:84%
to get out of your canoe
and go into your home,

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.750 align:middle line:90%
that these were at sea level.

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just saying that
to validate your point.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.531 align:middle line:90%
And he proved it out.

00:27:31.531 --> 00:27:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah, and
those ones you're

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:36.340 align:middle line:84%
talking about around the
Colorado Plateau, as I recall,

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.970 align:middle line:90%
there were three lakes there.

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:39.950 align:middle line:84%
There was another,
much larger lake

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:42.640 align:middle line:84%
called Lake Bonneville that
was up in the Utah Territories,

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.140 align:middle line:90%
which--

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right,
Bonneville Flats.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.578 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: --is now
Bonneville Flats,

00:27:45.578 --> 00:27:48.380 align:middle line:84%
but there were cities around the
perimeter of Lake Bonneville.

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
there are all kinds,

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.630 align:middle line:84%
and I won't go into
all the anomalies.

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'll still do the
documentary one day.

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:52.700 align:middle line:90%
So go ahead.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It would be
very good if you did.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.070 align:middle line:90%
So continue on.

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:58.260 align:middle line:84%
So now they were just
simply able to use

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.200 align:middle line:84%
whatever structures they
were in to get into the city.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Certainly.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the water level
was 1,800 feet higher

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.990 align:middle line:90%
than it is now.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:07.470 align:middle line:90%
And that's a known thing.

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:10.140 align:middle line:10%
It isn't like speculation.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:13.450 align:middle line:10%
But there was an earthquake,
this volcanic rock crumbled,

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:15.430 align:middle line:10%
and the water pressure
blew it apart.

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's now called
[? Quagid ?] Falls.

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, when Powell went
through and Kincaid followed,

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:29.510 align:middle line:84%
they were looking for
something very specific

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:32.690 align:middle line:84%
just beyond the convergence
of the Colorado and the Little

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Colorado.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.040 align:middle line:90%
That was specific.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And [? Quagid ?] Falls is
just downstream from there,

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:42.385 align:middle line:90%
just a few miles, not very far.

00:28:42.385 --> 00:28:45.840 align:middle line:90%


00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.989 align:middle line:84%
The people who were left
in there when that broke--

00:28:49.989 --> 00:28:52.280 align:middle line:84%
because there were people in
there when the water level

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.610 align:middle line:90%
went down.

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And what they had
done, they still

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:59.680 align:middle line:84%
had pilgrims coming there
after this had happened.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.896 align:middle line:84%
So they carved footholds,
handholds, all the way

00:29:02.896 --> 00:29:05.530 align:middle line:90%
from the river all the way up.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And the people inside had
access to the surface, which

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:14.000 align:middle line:84%
was another 2,000 feet,
roughly, up to the surface

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.810 align:middle line:90%
from inside the city.

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where they
would have their farms.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.750 align:middle line:84%
That's where they would
be growing things.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And they had taken
existing cracks and holes

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:27.650 align:middle line:84%
and embellished them so
they can go up there.

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Apparently it's a quite large
environment inside here.

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, when Kincaid
finds his way there,

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:45.780 align:middle line:84%
he finds those handles and
climbs up and goes inside.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the rest, as they
say, is the rest of the story,

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.460 align:middle line:84%
he went in examining,
finding, documenting,

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:53.670 align:middle line:90%
talking about what he found.

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's all something that's
part of historical record.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:57.050 align:middle line:90%
You read about it.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.710 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about once that
information made it back East.

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:04.590 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: So when Kincaid came
out of there and let them know,

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:06.880 align:middle line:90%
I found it, I have pictures.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Where
are those pictures?

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Nobody knows.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well,
actually, we know.

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:18.570 align:middle line:84%
They are in a vault.
Well, they were

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:19.850 align:middle line:90%
in the Smithsonian Institute.

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:22.520 align:middle line:90%
They play largely into this.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.440 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: The Smithsons.

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Smithsons.

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: England.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: England.

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about who the
Smithsons were and then what

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:32.070 align:middle line:84%
happened when the Smithsonian
got the scent of that trail.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, I don't really
know who the Smithsons were

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:36.770 align:middle line:90%
specifically.

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:40.870 align:middle line:84%
I speculate that they must
have been quite wealthy,

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:43.560 align:middle line:90%
somehow connected to the crown.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And remember, the
crown is not the queen.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:51.399 align:middle line:84%
The crown is the city,
this corporation.

00:30:51.399 --> 00:30:52.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: City of London.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Mhm.

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:59.710 align:middle line:84%
So you've got these
folks from England

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:02.810 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of money
and influence,

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:08.560 align:middle line:84%
who are somehow now
involved with this project.

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And you have someone in this
remote place, the Arizona

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:18.080 align:middle line:90%
Territory, Yuma, of all places.

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.880 align:middle line:84%
How far away from anywhere
is that from New York?

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.557 align:middle line:90%
Even today. [CHUCKLING]

00:31:25.557 --> 00:31:26.390 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Even today.

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:28.840 align:middle line:84%
But back then, if
you were to go there,

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:32.730 align:middle line:84%
it might take you
a month traveling.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:36.310 align:middle line:84%
But what happened next
was just remarkable.

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:38.900 align:middle line:84%
As soon as it's known,
within two weeks

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:42.720 align:middle line:84%
an expeditionary
force has assembled

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.710 align:middle line:84%
at the edge of the
Grand Canyon and is

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:49.190 align:middle line:84%
ready to do whatever they need
to do to get inside there.

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And this was
engineers, laborers,

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:55.380 align:middle line:90%
scientists of the time.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And they were all being paid
by the Smithsonian Institute.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.900 align:middle line:90%


00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.760 align:middle line:90%
And then 27 years goes by.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:09.470 align:middle line:84%
First it started out
with horse-drawn wagons

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:12.180 align:middle line:84%
and then a light rail
system of some sort.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:15.380 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't exist
there any longer.

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:18.270 align:middle line:84%
But we know that
this was the case

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:22.400 align:middle line:84%
because when you use infrared
satellite imagery and look,

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.740 align:middle line:84%
you can still see the evidence
of these lines and these tracks

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.460 align:middle line:84%
and where it started
where it went.

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:31.330 align:middle line:84%
This is how we were able to
determine where their base

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:35.840 align:middle line:84%
camp was, where their
point of the embarkation

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.190 align:middle line:90%
would be to go down the canyon.

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Because really, getting
anything out of the canyon

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:42.970 align:middle line:90%
is impossible.

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:44.050 align:middle line:90%
You can't go upstream.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:48.030 align:middle line:84%
You can't go downstream
with any ease.

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:50.449 align:middle line:84%
The only way to do it
is to go over the edge.

00:32:50.449 --> 00:32:52.490 align:middle line:84%
But the only way to
successfully go over the edge

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:56.300 align:middle line:84%
is to have plateaued
areas like stair steps

00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:00.140 align:middle line:84%
where you bring it up,
bring it up, bring it up.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And the last one would be
a hellish drop-off anyway.

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:09.970 align:middle line:90%
But we found it.

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:12.460 align:middle line:84%
We found where they had
mounted their equipment, where

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:23.320 align:middle line:84%
they had established their lines
of taking things in and out.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And then we started looking
a little bit more deeply,

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:29.240 align:middle line:84%
because surely,
you think about it,

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:32.020 align:middle line:84%
people go to a place like
that, they have trash.

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:33.050 align:middle line:90%
They can't help it.

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:34.440 align:middle line:90%
They're going to have trash.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Bottles are going
to break, people

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:40.010 align:middle line:84%
are going to drop a coin
out of their pocket.

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:44.040 align:middle line:84%
So we started looking more
closely, just checking,

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:49.190 align:middle line:84%
no digging, just checking and
finding things on the surface.

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And what we found were some
rather unusual and very old

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:54.490 align:middle line:90%
pieces.

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:56.980 align:middle line:90%
And why would they be there?

00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:01.640 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that if
I remember this correctly,

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:06.390 align:middle line:84%
it seems like it was Kincaid
that lost one of his oars

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:09.250 align:middle line:84%
during his journey
down the canyon.

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:10.949 align:middle line:90%
It was either Kincaid or Powell.

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:12.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't recall which.

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:17.420 align:middle line:84%
This is where Kathy comes in
handy, because she knows this.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:24.300 align:middle line:84%
We found an oar kind of buried
under some brush in the sand

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.930 align:middle line:90%
from that era.

00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:28.305 align:middle line:84%
Someone had found
it, apparently,

00:34:28.305 --> 00:34:30.555 align:middle line:84%
and just left it there,
thought they'd have a souvenir

00:34:30.555 --> 00:34:32.659 align:middle line:90%
and must have forgotten it.

00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:38.250 align:middle line:84%
We found broken bottles from
that era, all these things.

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:41.600 align:middle line:90%
But what did they find?

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.979 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course the pictures
would have told the story.

00:34:44.979 --> 00:34:49.409 align:middle line:90%


00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:54.060 align:middle line:84%
We can only guess
from what Kincaid said

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.179 align:middle line:90%
that he had seen inside there.

00:34:56.179 --> 00:34:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now let's
start talking about that.

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, a foundry
where apparently metals

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:05.170 align:middle line:90%
were being smelted down.

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:07.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Precious
metals and semi-precious.

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Mhm.

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:15.631 align:middle line:84%
Living quarters for all of
these people, the statuary.

00:35:15.631 --> 00:35:17.380 align:middle line:84%
But that's where it
gets a little strange,

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:22.756 align:middle line:84%
because the statuary had
nothing to do with Egyptians.

00:35:22.756 --> 00:35:24.927 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even though
there were sarcophagi.

00:35:24.927 --> 00:35:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: There were.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.620 align:middle line:84%
But Egyptians
weren't the only ones

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:30.870 align:middle line:84%
to wrap people up in
mummies, and especially 8-

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and 12-foot tall
mummies lined up

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:37.350 align:middle line:84%
on walls inside
of a large cavern.

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:39.930 align:middle line:90%


00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:43.475 align:middle line:84%
No, the type of
statuary they found

00:35:43.475 --> 00:35:48.840 align:middle line:84%
in there were the
same sort of things

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:53.030 align:middle line:84%
that you would expect to
find if you went to Asia,

00:35:53.030 --> 00:36:00.320 align:middle line:84%
the same kind of abstract
gods and goddesses

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:07.910 align:middle line:84%
that you would find over there,
statues with the lotus design

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:11.880 align:middle line:84%
and statues with--
it wasn't like it

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.220 align:middle line:90%
was any one particular culture.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Apparently there were several
cultures represented, even

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:25.800 align:middle line:84%
cultures going into the
Indian culture and Angkor Wat

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:31.560 align:middle line:84%
and that sort of thing,
this whole menagerie of--

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Asiatic thing.

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:35.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Asiatic
things inside there.

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.840 align:middle line:84%
I want to just add
something at this point,

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:42.000 align:middle line:84%
too, because you and I both
know-- we've met this person.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.120 align:middle line:84%
There was a man who was also
an explorer in modern times,

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.420 align:middle line:84%
taking people through there,
took a lot of photographs.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And he had discovered some of
the clay burial tombs of some

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:57.170 align:middle line:90%
of these people in Arizona.

00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And again, just overlaying
what you were saying,

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.160 align:middle line:84%
I saw the pictures
of them, and they

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.000 align:middle line:84%
were shocking and
extraordinary, because these

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.270 align:middle line:90%
were the-- we call them giants.

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:09.729 align:middle line:84%
They were between 9 and 14
feet tall or 15 feet tall.

00:37:09.729 --> 00:37:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: They were quite large.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And with red hair and
very surprising clothing on,

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.390 align:middle line:90%
just shocking clothing.

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:18.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
the ones they call

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:23.700 align:middle line:84%
kind of zoot suits
in proximity to this.

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:25.860 align:middle line:84%
So now, he was
threatened, and I want

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.080 align:middle line:84%
to talk about that in
a little bit with you.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.670 align:middle line:84%
He was threatened,
and when I was

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:32.600 align:middle line:84%
about to do an interview
with him, he finally said,

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.770 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it.

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:36.651 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid.

00:37:36.651 --> 00:37:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah, it's a little
scary talking about that stuff.

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:40.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:42.100 align:middle line:84%
So OK, while you're
exploring this,

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:43.960 align:middle line:84%
maybe add your
little piece of that.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:48.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm just validating the photos I
saw of these giants, which I've

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:51.230 align:middle line:84%
never seen anywhere else or
again except his little slide

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:52.590 align:middle line:90%
show for a few people.

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: These people,
whoever they were,

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:00.600 align:middle line:84%
who were in the Grand Canyon,
were not the first inhabitants

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.010 align:middle line:90%
of that region.

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:05.415 align:middle line:84%
Right off of the Grand Canyon
is a place called Marble Canyon.

00:38:05.415 --> 00:38:08.130 align:middle line:90%


00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's replete with giants
and the lure of giants

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:18.420 align:middle line:84%
and its own unique mysteries
that are taking place in there.

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And Richard
Dewhurst is another author

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:22.430 align:middle line:84%
that I've interviewed,
and if anyone

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:24.740 align:middle line:84%
wants to take a look
at that, there's

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.050 align:middle line:84%
a lot of representation
of that in that interview,

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:29.279 align:middle line:84%
too, the giants
of North America.

00:38:29.279 --> 00:38:31.695 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, and Kathy has
uncovered so much about that,

00:38:31.695 --> 00:38:32.130 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:33.099 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mm.

00:38:33.099 --> 00:38:34.890 align:middle line:84%
We'll have another
conversation about that,

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:36.700 align:middle line:90%
just the giants alone, then.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.110 align:middle line:90%
OK, go ahead.

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:42.240 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, no one
knows what level of things

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:46.870 align:middle line:84%
were taken out of there, but you
figure-- was it 23 or 27 years?

00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:49.800 align:middle line:84%
But it was a long
time either way.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of things
were taken out.

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:53.650 align:middle line:90%
Where did they go?

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:56.646 align:middle line:90%
They went back to England.

00:38:56.646 --> 00:38:58.520 align:middle line:84%
That's as far as we've
been able to trace it.

00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, they didn't
end up in the museum.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.300 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Uh-uh.

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:06.975 align:middle line:84%
There were some things that were
taken back to Washington, DC,

00:39:06.975 --> 00:39:09.604 align:middle line:84%
to the Smithsonian Institute
there and kept away.

00:39:09.604 --> 00:39:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And they are probably
still there, but--

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.989 align:middle line:84%
The majority of them
the research shows

00:39:16.989 --> 00:39:18.030 align:middle line:90%
ended up back in England?

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:19.240 align:middle line:90%
Or is that a supposition?

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well,
that's a supposition,

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:23.560 align:middle line:90%
because we're not sure.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.770 align:middle line:84%
We did find one ship's--
well, Kathy found one

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:28.720 align:middle line:90%
ship's manifest, as I recall.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:33.800 align:middle line:84%
And it showed that it had
these artifacts on the ship.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And it was headed
back to England.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.330 align:middle line:84%
But then something
happened, and the ship

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:44.560 align:middle line:90%
sank just off of San Francisco.

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:48.330 align:middle line:84%
So we're not sure exactly
what the story is there,

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:50.130 align:middle line:84%
but the ship
apparently did sink.

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:53.440 align:middle line:90%


00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:56.140 align:middle line:84%
So who knows what
happened to these things?

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:58.930 align:middle line:84%
The interesting point to
me is that they couldn't

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.655 align:middle line:84%
get everything out because there
were some things inside there

00:40:01.655 --> 00:40:04.020 align:middle line:84%
that were way too large to
get out through the entrance.

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:06.750 align:middle line:84%
They had been
created inside there,

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:15.734 align:middle line:84%
hewn from solid rock, large
statues, maybe like Angkor Wat.

00:40:15.734 --> 00:40:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Was there a
description of those statutes?

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:18.670 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh, there was, yeah.

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And those
are the ones you

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:24.460 align:middle line:84%
say are more like a variety of
East Asiatic gods that had been

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:25.822 align:middle line:90%
worshipped throughout history.

00:40:25.822 --> 00:40:27.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yes.

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:29.050 align:middle line:90%
And they couldn't get them out.

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:31.240 align:middle line:90%
So they're still there.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:35.150 align:middle line:84%
So we decided we would try
to get into this place.

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Went and talked with
the Native Americans.

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:43.170 align:middle line:84%
The ones who control
and have dominance

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:47.500 align:middle line:84%
in that particular
area are the Hopi.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And we were already good
friends with the Hopi nation.

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Went and spoke with
some of the elders,

00:40:55.810 --> 00:41:00.150 align:middle line:84%
and it's like, why do
you want to go there?

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:01.610 align:middle line:90%
That's the City of the Dead.

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:03.870 align:middle line:90%
You shouldn't go there.

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:06.280 align:middle line:90%
Leave them alone.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.840 align:middle line:90%
So we said, well, OK.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:08.640 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.070 align:middle line:84%
But this is also a
place of antiquity,

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:15.000 align:middle line:84%
and we'd like to
know more about it.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So they were like, well, if you
go there, you're on your own.

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:21.580 align:middle line:84%
If you get in trouble,
don't call us.

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Mhm.

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:22.900 align:middle line:90%
Bad juju.

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:24.060 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But if you
want to go, go ahead.

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ancestors unhappy.

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:28.220 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:34.050 align:middle line:84%
So one night, we were there
with our research team.

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think this was like
year two or year three.

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And a terrific
storm is blowing up.

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:49.930 align:middle line:84%
There was a storm to the north
and a storm to the south.

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps it was east and
west, because there, directions

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:55.940 align:middle line:90%
get slightly askew.

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:58.910 align:middle line:84%
But there was a storm on either
side of us, a huge storm.

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Lightning is flashing
in the distance

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.591 align:middle line:90%
over here and over here.

00:42:02.591 --> 00:42:04.965 align:middle line:84%
Wind is blowing from this
direction, then that direction.

00:42:04.965 --> 00:42:07.610 align:middle line:90%


00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:12.450 align:middle line:84%
In the midst of this becoming
more and more powerful,

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:16.400 align:middle line:84%
lightning dances across
a hillside over here,

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:20.650 align:middle line:84%
and there are these three
figures just standing there.

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:24.680 align:middle line:84%
They must have been
12, 15 feet tall.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.820 align:middle line:84%
You only saw them
during that point

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:31.550 align:middle line:84%
where the lightning was dancing,
and then they were gone.

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:33.710 align:middle line:90%
And we didn't see them again.

00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:38.480 align:middle line:84%
But it was like something very,
very strange was going on.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.150 align:middle line:84%
The wind blew so
hard that it nearly

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:44.650 align:middle line:90%
blew us into the Grand Canyon.

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:46.286 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
dangerous situation.

00:42:46.286 --> 00:42:51.750 align:middle line:90%


00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Now I just think about
that and shudder because--

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:54.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Did you get a sense or feeling
why they showed themselves

00:42:58.620 --> 00:42:59.820 align:middle line:90%
to you at that time?

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: I think it
was more of a warning.

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:04.077 align:middle line:90%
Stop, don't go any farther.

00:43:04.077 --> 00:43:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now you
got it from the Hopis,

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:08.230 align:middle line:84%
and you got it
from the big guys.

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Did you get it from the
government or anyone else?

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: No, we didn't When we
were looking for the giants--

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:18.180 align:middle line:84%
because this was a parallel
thing that was going on.

00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I see.

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:20.180 align:middle line:90%
Yes, OK.

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: We were warned to stop.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Because we had gotten to the
point to where we figured,

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:34.266 align:middle line:84%
look, all we need is a molar
or some of that red hair.

00:43:34.266 --> 00:43:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kind of like the other
guy we're talking about, yeah.

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:37.690 align:middle line:90%
Stop.

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:40.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Just get a DNA sample,
find out who these people were.

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:42.650 align:middle line:84%
It just seems like
a reasonable thing.

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:45.470 align:middle line:90%


00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And we found where the
giants were-- the same person.

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:52.090 align:middle line:84%
He's the one who told us,
the giants are right here,

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:57.440 align:middle line:84%
I'll take you there, and let's
just find out who they are.

00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And about two days before
we're ready to go and do that,

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:05.360 align:middle line:84%
a phone call comes in
the middle of the night.

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Don't know who it is,
just someone warning us,

00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:13.295 align:middle line:90%
don't do this or else.

00:44:13.295 --> 00:44:16.010 align:middle line:90%


00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:18.869 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm not one to be
frightened off that easily.

00:44:18.869 --> 00:44:20.035 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, or else what?

00:44:20.035 --> 00:44:22.710 align:middle line:90%


00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:25.330 align:middle line:90%
Um, prison.

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:27.575 align:middle line:90%
We're watching you.

00:44:27.575 --> 00:44:29.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's what
happened to the other guy, too.

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Mhm.

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And they knew him and said
they were watching him.

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And then it suddenly
all came together.

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:47.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like nothing is worth
taking that kind of risk for.

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:48.700 align:middle line:90%
So forget it.

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, now there was
something else, as I recall,

00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:53.570 align:middle line:90%
you said.

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:55.253 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is was
in a conversation.

00:44:55.253 --> 00:44:58.390 align:middle line:90%


00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:59.910 align:middle line:84%
It seems like it
would be relatively

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:04.020 align:middle line:84%
easy to access that city
if you could go down

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:08.797 align:middle line:84%
from above the way they had
come up and down to their crops.

00:45:08.797 --> 00:45:09.880 align:middle line:90%
But you couldn't see that.

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:12.030 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't evident
anymore, that opening?

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:12.830 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Well, no.

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:16.000 align:middle line:84%
What they had done is they had
filled these things in back

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.630 align:middle line:90%
in the day when they were there.

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:20.535 align:middle line:84%
They were using that to go
down and bring things out,

00:45:20.535 --> 00:45:22.410 align:middle line:84%
because when they went
down and went through,

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:24.320 align:middle line:84%
they found, and
came out that way.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:27.600 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't get things
out very well in those ways,

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:31.260 align:middle line:84%
but this is how they got
up to do their farming.

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.270 align:middle line:84%
So to keep people from
getting in there--

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:36.950 align:middle line:84%
because you have to remember
that the Navajo and Hopi were

00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:41.790 align:middle line:84%
living there, and they didn't
want them going in there,

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:43.290 align:middle line:84%
so they just filled
these places in.

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:44.706 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They
sealed it off, mhm.

00:45:44.706 --> 00:45:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: We know where
those places are.

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:50.040 align:middle line:90%
You can't get into them anymore.

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.622 align:middle line:90%
They're just--

00:45:51.622 --> 00:45:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's full.

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:53.000 align:middle line:90%
It's filled in.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.740 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: It is, but you can feel
cold air coming out of there

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:57.020 align:middle line:90%
if you do to the right place.

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.061 align:middle line:90%
It's obvious where it is.

00:45:58.061 --> 00:46:00.600 align:middle line:84%
You can see it on infrared
satellite photography as well.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:01.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to ask.

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:02.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Well now, OK, let's take a
little sidebar to this story.

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:09.840 align:middle line:84%
How do the Mormons
fit into any of this?

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Oh, this is another
completely interesting aspect

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:18.420 align:middle line:84%
of it, because the Mormons--
and I'm not that up

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:23.070 align:middle line:84%
on their religion to where I
can really talk about it much.

00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:25.760 align:middle line:84%
So I'll probably
slaughter that part.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And I apologize to the
Mormon community in advance.

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, my understanding
is that Joseph Smith was also

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:35.050 align:middle line:84%
a person in a certain
lineage with a great amount

00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:37.980 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge, such as what the
Templars and others possessed.

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Right.

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And how he got that
information is real sketchy.

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Golden plates, visits with an
angel call Moroni, as I recall.

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:53.410 align:middle line:90%


00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, as far as the
Grand Canyon goes

00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:02.880 align:middle line:84%
and the giants and the
ancient lost civilization that

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.550 align:middle line:84%
was in that part
of North America,

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:08.210 align:middle line:90%
it all kind of ties in together.

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:12.010 align:middle line:84%
It ties in together also
with some anomalous things

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:16.520 align:middle line:84%
that we found, which I don't
know what to call them.

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it seems trite
to call these portals,

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:27.290 align:middle line:84%
but there are passageways
of some sort that

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:34.390 align:middle line:84%
move through time that are
very old, very ancient.

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:36.550 align:middle line:90%
And I'm speculating, of course.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and the Southwest

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:40.020 align:middle line:84%
is known to have
several of these.

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Oh, yeah.

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:42.400 align:middle line:90%
We know.

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.190 align:middle line:84%
It's not a question
of, is it real?

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:45.360 align:middle line:90%
We know it's real.

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:46.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's been
written about by

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:48.520 align:middle line:90%
some other anonymous authors.

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:49.890 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:47:49.890 --> 00:47:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And we've
investigated this quite deeply.

00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:59.630 align:middle line:84%
But how the Mormon culture fits
into this particular region

00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:04.280 align:middle line:84%
is that they know something
was going on there as well.

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, their idea of
who these people were

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:11.980 align:middle line:84%
and what they were
doing is their own idea.

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:14.484 align:middle line:84%
We don't know who these
people were anyway, really.

00:48:14.484 --> 00:48:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
and they do have--

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:17.606 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know a
lot about Mormonism,

00:48:17.606 --> 00:48:19.980 align:middle line:84%
either, so forgive me anyone
who's a Mormon or ex-Mormon,

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:26.590 align:middle line:84%
but it is a much more
cosmically aligned religion.

00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: But they have
evidence of something

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:33.440 align:middle line:84%
remarkable from
back in the past.

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.592 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't evidence of like
things written on the wall

00:48:36.592 --> 00:48:40.100 align:middle line:84%
or that sort of-- I mean,
they have tangible things

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:43.820 align:middle line:84%
like gold plates with
inscriptions on them, copper

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:50.100 align:middle line:90%
plates, brass, or bronze, even.

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:54.230 align:middle line:84%
We know of one fellow that
found a cave just stacked full.

00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:57.670 align:middle line:84%
It was a huge cavern with
thousands-- not hundreds,

00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:03.530 align:middle line:84%
but thousands-- of bronze
plates that were-- what was it?

00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:08.720 align:middle line:84%
It was four foot by two
foot by-- what was it?

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:10.831 align:middle line:90%
Eight inches thick.

00:49:10.831 --> 00:49:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It would
take Herculean strength

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:13.980 align:middle line:90%
to move those about.

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: And they were stacked
up inside of this cavern.

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:20.930 align:middle line:90%
He thought he'd found gold.

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, bronze, as
I recall, was often

00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:29.110 align:middle line:84%
found alongside other
of the areas that had

00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:30.630 align:middle line:90%
the remains of giants as well.

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:34.590 align:middle line:84%
That was a very prized
and used commodity.

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: It was.

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:42.710 align:middle line:84%
So when these Mormon
folks find these things,

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:45.160 align:middle line:84%
they find them
underground always,

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.770 align:middle line:84%
inside of caves,
inside of caverns,

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:51.270 align:middle line:84%
going through a tunnel,
and there's a room.

00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And what I noticed about the
culture in a microcosmic sense

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:03.470 align:middle line:84%
is that there is always
a struggle for power.

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:05.470 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be, anyway,
a struggle for power.

00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And you find something like
this, it makes you a prophet

00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:10.280 align:middle line:84%
and makes you someone
who's special.

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And so you keep a secret, and
you have the piece of power,

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:17.930 align:middle line:90%
and you don't relinquish that.

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:20.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't let anyone
see it or touch it.

00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:26.320 align:middle line:84%
But there is those that have let
us see things and touch them.

00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:29.090 align:middle line:90%


00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And for them, it
wasn't about power.

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:34.160 align:middle line:84%
It was about
understanding the past.

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Then folks are like, well,
what's written on these plates?

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.050 align:middle line:90%
Think of it this way.

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:43.380 align:middle line:84%
If you had a grain
bin and you were

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:45.884 align:middle line:84%
keeping track of who took
what, you would probably put it

00:50:45.884 --> 00:50:47.175 align:middle line:90%
on something that would endure.

00:50:47.175 --> 00:50:51.220 align:middle line:90%


00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:55.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that they have
the keys to understanding

00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:57.320 align:middle line:90%
the universe on them.

00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:01.910 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
probably very mediocre

00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and common pieces
of information that

00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:07.550 align:middle line:84%
were important to the people
then, who's doing what,

00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:10.540 align:middle line:84%
here's a laundry list,
that sort of thing.

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, there probably
are plates that

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:16.271 align:middle line:84%
have some amazing
information on them.

00:51:16.271 --> 00:51:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And truly, if you had the
plate and you read it,

00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:21.250 align:middle line:84%
it would be amazing information
no matter what's on it.

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:23.310 align:middle line:84%
But we tend to
fantasize and think

00:51:23.310 --> 00:51:26.420 align:middle line:84%
they might be something
really, really special.

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:30.850 align:middle line:84%
But I have seen these,
and I'm not so sure

00:51:30.850 --> 00:51:33.330 align:middle line:90%
that they're all that special.

00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Some things are, but not
by and large all of them.

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:39.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Record-keeping.

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Yeah, record-keeping
on something that would endure.

00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:44.857 align:middle line:90%


00:51:44.857 --> 00:51:46.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or was
plentiful, available,

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.420 align:middle line:84%
and what you
primarily used anyway.

00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:49.740 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Sure.

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:51.350 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:54.360 align:middle line:84%
But there was something
else going on there, too,

00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:58.828 align:middle line:84%
something else that
remains obscure.

00:51:58.828 --> 00:52:02.640 align:middle line:84%
The dynamic that
you're looking at here

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:08.730 align:middle line:84%
are ancient civilizations
that go back a very long time.

00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:15.750 align:middle line:84%
But you also have some very
strange things with references

00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:17.700 align:middle line:90%
to people from the sky.

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, that
was my next question.

00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:22.052 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was
going to get into.

00:52:22.052 --> 00:52:23.760 align:middle line:84%
I've done a couple of
interviews recently

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:27.271 align:middle line:84%
that had to do with underground
civilizations of ETs.

00:52:27.271 --> 00:52:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, and I
think that's probably

00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:30.853 align:middle line:84%
a safe place for them
to be if they're going

00:52:30.853 --> 00:52:33.480 align:middle line:90%
to stay any amount of time.

00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:38.330 align:middle line:84%
One of things that
we've not seen

00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:44.260 align:middle line:84%
but we had reliable sources,
Native Americans that we know

00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.860 align:middle line:84%
and we trust, and
they have no reason

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:51.822 align:middle line:84%
to tell us anything,
especially just tell us some--

00:52:51.822 --> 00:52:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Cockamamie story.

00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: Yeah.

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:56.000 align:middle line:84%
They're telling us about all
these things off in this genre

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.880 align:middle line:84%
about ancient cities and
civilizations and da-da-da-da

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.689 align:middle line:84%
and places and the
City of the Dead.

00:53:00.689 --> 00:53:02.230 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden,
you get a story.

00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:04.760 align:middle line:90%


00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:08.290 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that there's
this egg-shaped thing?

00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:09.600 align:middle line:90%
It's a spaceship.

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.440 align:middle line:90%
It's caught in this crevice.

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And we tried and tried to get it
freed and get it out of there.

00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:18.460 align:middle line:90%
It's from ancient times.

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:20.200 align:middle line:10%
And, well, somebody
in the village

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:22.810 align:middle line:10%
talked about it somebody else,
and it got out and went over

00:53:22.810 --> 00:53:23.852 align:middle line:10%
here and went over there.

00:53:23.852 --> 00:53:25.476 align:middle line:10%
The next thing you
know, the government

00:53:25.476 --> 00:53:27.430 align:middle line:10%
shows up with a team of
people on helicopters.

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:29.410 align:middle line:10%
They clear it, pull
it out, take it away.

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:31.093 align:middle line:10%
And we aren't very
happy about it.

00:53:31.093 --> 00:53:32.676 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what
that might have been?

00:53:32.676 --> 00:53:35.940 align:middle line:90%


00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:38.889 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:53:38.889 --> 00:53:39.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, it was a spaceship.

00:53:39.930 --> 00:53:40.770 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, how do you know
it was a spaceship?

00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:44.353 align:middle line:84%
Because as I got it
loose, it floated.

00:53:44.353 --> 00:53:47.970 align:middle line:90%


00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:51.800 align:middle line:90%
There are so many references.

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:53.890 align:middle line:90%
And not just in the Southwest.

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:55.230 align:middle line:90%
Go anywhere in the world.

00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:56.313 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, that's true.

00:53:56.313 --> 00:53:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And they have their own
names for the star people,

00:53:58.570 --> 00:54:02.940 align:middle line:84%
and they align with
them as their ancestors.

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And as this other book,
fictionalized work

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:11.380 align:middle line:84%
by Ken Cherry, another
person I interviewed, said,

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:14.315 align:middle line:84%
you can't even calls
them ETs necessarily.

00:54:14.315 --> 00:54:15.690 align:middle line:84%
The ones who live
under the Earth

00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:17.770 align:middle line:84%
may have been here
longer than humanity.

00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:19.550 align:middle line:90%
It's just their domain.

00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: Well, and I've
got a theory about that.

00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:24.035 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure we'll
get into that.

00:54:24.035 --> 00:54:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we'll get into
that in our next conversation,

00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:27.240 align:middle line:90%
you think.

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:28.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WILLS: That sounds
like a good idea.

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Might that
work well there?

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:30.230 align:middle line:90%
>>WILLS: I think so.

00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.620 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because we're
talking anomalies.

focusing on an
anomalous archway that

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:10.902 align:middle line:10%
