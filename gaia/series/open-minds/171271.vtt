>>REGINA MEREDITH: Alongside
the Knights of the Round Table,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.620 align:middle line:10%
perhaps the next most intriguing
group of mystical gentleman

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.080 align:middle line:10%
were the Knight Templar.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Freddy Silva has been
tracking their history

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.630 align:middle line:90%
for more than a decade.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.420 align:middle line:10%
And has written a book
that is altering history--

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.392 align:middle line:10%
the First Templar Nation.

00:00:43.392 --> 00:00:45.350 align:middle line:10%
We have spoken about the
Knight Templar before,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.930 align:middle line:10%
but now all the
threads come together.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:84%
All I can say Freddy
is, well done.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.590 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this was a massive work.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.280 align:middle line:90%
We were just talking off camera.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.420 align:middle line:84%
And there were times I could
only read 20 to 30 pages

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.810 align:middle line:90%
in a day, because it's so rich.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.490 align:middle line:90%
It's like, OK, wait a minute.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.740 align:middle line:84%
If these guys were doing
this, and these guys

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.210 align:middle line:84%
were doing that, what motivated
these guys to do that.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.010 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.690 align:middle line:90%
>>FREDDY SILVA: Exactly.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
absolutely stunning work.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.770 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.811 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Well, thank you.

00:01:10.811 --> 00:01:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --it has
taken over a decade.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I think I lost a lot
of my hair because of that.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.880 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Well, maybe.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I thought it was
something else, but no.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.540 align:middle line:90%
It was a very rich story.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.340 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's an
incredible story.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.975 align:middle line:84%
And I'm intrigued with it for
a variety of reasons, which

00:01:25.975 --> 00:01:27.650 align:middle line:84%
is why we're going
to have a really

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.540 align:middle line:84%
expansive talk about it that's
going to be in two parts.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.510 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to set
that up first off.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.510 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: You're twisting my arm.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --we've seen
little bits of this story

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.239 align:middle line:84%
in some of your other
work, as you were making

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:39.530 align:middle line:90%
your discoveries along the way.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.890 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Mm-hmm.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We would talk
about a piece of it here,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.250 align:middle line:90%
and a piece of it there.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And now, as I just said, all
the strings come together.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, originally
I was just trying

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.930 align:middle line:84%
to write a very simple
book about the reason

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:84%
why the Knights Templar
were so fascinated

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.560 align:middle line:84%
with my original
country of birth,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.970 align:middle line:84%
which, of course by my
actions, it's Portugal.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Portugal.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.570 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's part of the
witness protection program.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And I thought this would
be a nice simple story.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And then I got to this big block
right in the middle of this.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, why am
I getting this block?

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.407 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I realized I don't
know part of the story here.

00:02:12.407 --> 00:02:13.490 align:middle line:90%
There's something missing.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.780 align:middle line:90%
A big piece of the story.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And it really had to do with the
understanding of sacred space,

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.900 align:middle line:84%
which is something that is
something that's not always

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.009 align:middle line:90%
associated with the Templars.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And once I understood
what sacred space really does,

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.860 align:middle line:84%
and how it works, and what
the Templars have discovered

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.740 align:middle line:90%
on to Jerusalem--

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --then, suddenly
this big window of opportunity

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.430 align:middle line:90%
opens up four years later.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.234 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well, that's
what I was missing.

00:02:37.234 --> 00:02:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Because now everything starts
to fit in very, very nicely.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.608 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're right.

00:02:40.608 --> 00:02:42.067 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with
the sacred space.

00:02:42.067 --> 00:02:42.866 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It has to do with
those incredibly divine

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.900 align:middle line:84%
structures where
people have literally

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.450 align:middle line:84%
consciousness-altering
experiences.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.560 align:middle line:90%
They were the masters.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.980 align:middle line:90%
They had the knowledge.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And I would argue, it's
been carried forward

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.681 align:middle line:84%
this whole story
originated in Atlantis.

00:02:57.681 --> 00:02:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get into
that a little bit

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.730 align:middle line:84%
later, because that's the
part that I love about it.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.410 align:middle line:84%
It's this continuation
of passed-on knowledge

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.240 align:middle line:84%
that has been secreted away
throughout history until right

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.040 align:middle line:90%
now, really.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, yeah.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know, with
the explosion of media.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.930 align:middle line:84%
I think first, let's
start at this one place.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.640 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you
have these stories

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.110 align:middle line:84%
that are just so
simplistic they're

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.360 align:middle line:84%
like children's
fables, that are aired

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.590 align:middle line:84%
on a lot of the networks
about the Templars.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.730 align:middle line:84%
It's just ridiculous to see how
they're still being portrayed.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And in light of your
book, it's absurd.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.120 align:middle line:84%
But still, in the
common mind you

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:84%
have a feeling that these
were men of valor on one hand,

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.660 align:middle line:84%
and the other
sentiment is that these

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.330 align:middle line:90%
were bloody and greedy bankers.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
reducing it down.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.507 align:middle line:90%
What were they?

00:03:45.507 --> 00:03:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, I mean, that
was a part of the thing that

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.680 align:middle line:84%
took so long to begin, which
was what I had the problem with.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Which was, yes, we see them
as bloodthirsty people,

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.672 align:middle line:90%
as glory hounds, mercenaries.

00:03:57.672 --> 00:03:58.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, that was the crusaders.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.010 align:middle line:84%
The crusaders are
not the Templars.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.420 align:middle line:90%
And that was a big aha.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.755 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, once you get
to that point in the story,

00:04:04.755 --> 00:04:06.380 align:middle line:84%
you begin to realize
that this is going

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.850 align:middle line:90%
to get really complicated.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Because what happened
wasn't the period.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.290 align:middle line:84%
We have a moment in
time where the church

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.780 align:middle line:84%
is trying to get hold of
Jerusalem back from the Arabs.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.730 align:middle line:84%
This has been an ongoing
conflict forever.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.209 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
moment in time

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.870 align:middle line:84%
where they had the
opportunity to actually get

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.286 align:middle line:84%
a whole bunch of
people, convinced

00:04:23.286 --> 00:04:25.430 align:middle line:84%
them to go down to
Jerusalem, and literally

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.960 align:middle line:90%
take over the place.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And it gave permission for
a small group of people,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.650 align:middle line:84%
a close group knit
of people to actually

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.070 align:middle line:84%
ride on the back of the
Crusades, almost quietly,

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.877 align:middle line:84%
and infiltrate the
Templars of Jerusalem.

00:04:39.877 --> 00:04:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And specific structures
in that city--

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --in order to
do what they were doing.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.380 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that there was
a kind of a moment in time

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.110 align:middle line:84%
where they took the
opportunity to actually get

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.405 align:middle line:84%
a handful of men in there
to do something very secret.

00:04:54.405 --> 00:04:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Nothing to do with
the Crusades at all.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.860 align:middle line:84%
It was basically
a means to an end.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And this is--

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.989 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Very opportune.

00:04:58.989 --> 00:05:01.675 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was going to say
at every point in the story--

00:05:01.675 --> 00:05:03.800 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to start
weaving the story together

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.730 align:middle line:90%
in a moment--

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.250 align:middle line:90%
there's opportunism.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes the
opportunism is born out of--

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.407 align:middle line:84%
there's always a need on the
part of one party or another.

00:05:13.407 --> 00:05:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's on the
part of the church

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.150 align:middle line:84%
to stop the invasion
of the Arabs,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.340 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's the
same and among the royal

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.760 align:middle line:84%
classes in various
countries, there

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.740 align:middle line:90%
is a need that has to be met.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And these men, these Templars--
and we're going to talk about

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.340 align:middle line:84%
the various kinds of
Templars there were--

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.710 align:middle line:84%
really rode that opportunity in
many different ways, perfectly.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.510 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.700 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as though they were
just sliding along the back of.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.900 align:middle line:84%
But yet they were right at
the middle of everything.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.780 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, let's talk
about how this story differs

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.780 align:middle line:84%
from what we see on the History
Channel and other networks.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.758 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Well, that's
not too difficult.

00:05:55.758 --> 00:05:56.793 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:56.793 --> 00:05:59.790 align:middle line:10%
But basically, the
original story, of course,

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.270 align:middle line:10%
is that nine guys
rode all the way

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.360 align:middle line:10%
from what today is Belgium,
to go to the Middle East

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.160 align:middle line:10%
to protect the pilgrims.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.930 align:middle line:10%
Now, you've got
a stretch of land

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.900 align:middle line:10%
which is 33 miles,
filled with brigands,

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.890 align:middle line:10%
mountain lions, Saracens,
other-- the very annoyed people

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.410 align:middle line:10%
who don't like Europeans.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.180 align:middle line:84%
So you've got nine guys who are
patrolling tens of thousands

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.980 align:middle line:90%
of pilgrims.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a
ridiculous concept.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And also, historically-- yeah,
to take the sarcasm out of it,

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.680 align:middle line:84%
historically, the
Knights Hospitaller,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.779 align:middle line:84%
which were already
40 years old by then,

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:34.820 align:middle line:84%
they were already in charge
of doing that anyway.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.790 align:middle line:84%
So why do you need nine guys
to go and do what was already

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.519 align:middle line:90%
being done by about 5,000?

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:41.810 align:middle line:90%
And doing it very well as well.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:42.275 align:middle line:90%
Very efficiently.

00:06:42.275 --> 00:06:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.601 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So the whole
thing is a big smokescreen.

00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:46.640 align:middle line:84%
I think it just got
taken out of context.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.181 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I think we need
to also understand it weren't

00:06:49.181 --> 00:06:50.300 align:middle line:90%
just the Knight Templars.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.040 align:middle line:90%
You say "hos-pi-ta-llers"?

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.340 align:middle line:90%
Or "hospi-ta-llers"?

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.610 align:middle line:90%
How do you pronounce that?

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: "hos-pi-ta-leur."

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, "hos-pi-ta-leur."

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:56.210 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.010 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.010 align:middle line:90%
So we have them.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.770 align:middle line:84%
We have the Order of
Sion Knights, right?

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.230 align:middle line:10%
And we also have the Knights
of the Holy Sepulcher.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.050 align:middle line:84%
We have the Knights of Malta,
which most of us have heard of.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It sounds like
it's a Monty Python

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.160 align:middle line:90%
movie really, doesn't it?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It really does.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.850 align:middle line:84%
But it all keeps getting
boiled down to the Knight

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.040 align:middle line:90%
Templar, these nine guys.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yup.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And actually, all of these
people are all interconnected.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.870 align:middle line:84%
They're all
supporting each other.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And yes, originally
in about 1904--

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:84%
not 1904-- 1104--
there was a group

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.140 align:middle line:84%
of people who did join the
Holy Sepulcher, where Hugues de

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Payens, and Godfrey
de Saint-Omer,

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.830 align:middle line:84%
the nucleus of what became
the Templars, were residing.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think they tried
to start something.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And I was reading a
lot of the surviving

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.486 align:middle line:90%
extracts from the time.

00:07:37.486 --> 00:07:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And they were having
a really hard time

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.270 align:middle line:84%
trying to recruit the
right kind of knight

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.160 align:middle line:90%
to do something very important.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.191 align:middle line:84%
Because you keep reading between
the lines, and Hugues de Payens

00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:47.690 align:middle line:84%
was really struggling
to find people

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.000 align:middle line:84%
who had certain spiritual
angle on things.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.620 align:middle line:84%
They weren't there
to do any fighting.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.400 align:middle line:84%
They rarely did any
fighting at all--

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --which
was kind of odd.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:55.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Why would a
bunch of very rich people

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.040 align:middle line:84%
go 2000 miles to the Middle East
and then not do any fighting,

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.690 align:middle line:84%
and also give up
all their wealth

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:06.812 align:middle line:90%
to go and look for wealth?

00:08:06.812 --> 00:08:07.770 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't make any sense.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.008 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And you'd
have to dig up tunnels

00:08:10.008 --> 00:08:12.590 align:middle line:84%
as well in
excruciating conditions

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.811 align:middle line:90%
to find this alleged wealth.

00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:16.310 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing
just doesn't add up.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.371 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So you have a group,
which is the Knight of the Holy

00:08:19.371 --> 00:08:22.130 align:middle line:84%
Sepulcher, moving in
just at the time when

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.420 align:middle line:90%
Jerusalem is liberated.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.060 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
you had the patriarch

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.120 align:middle line:84%
of Jerusalem, Godfrey de
Bouillon, who basically

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.560 align:middle line:84%
installed another
group of knights

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.320 align:middle line:84%
in the Church of the
Sion, or Mount Sion,

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.169 align:middle line:90%
in a ruined basilica.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
another group of people,

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.780 align:middle line:84%
who are just basically going
in-between connecting the dots.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So it is excruciatingly
difficult

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.900 align:middle line:84%
to separate all those people
and find out in the end,

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.740 align:middle line:84%
they were all kind
of collaborating.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.230 align:middle line:84%
But still, they had nothing
to do with the Crusades.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.820 align:middle line:84%
It was basically a
big moment in time,

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.410 align:middle line:90%
a big window of opportunity.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:58.550 align:middle line:84%
As though some organization had
been waiting for 1,000 years

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:02.450 align:middle line:84%
to finish what the Assyrians
had started and finished when

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:03.890 align:middle line:90%
the Romans invaded Jerusalem.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
the story goes back to.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: 2000 years earlier.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So before we
go there, let's go back

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.980 align:middle line:90%
just a little bit further.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:16.160 align:middle line:84%
And let's go back into the
period you're talking about,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.640 align:middle line:84%
where Burgundy was actually
the center of enlightenment.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.890 align:middle line:84%
Because this is not
something most people

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.080 align:middle line:84%
are aware of when we think
of the Enlightenment.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.320 align:middle line:84%
So let's just start
pulling threads together.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And I know people have to
read the book and sit with it,

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.100 align:middle line:90%
and re--

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.570 align:middle line:84%
just have it as
their companion--

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.550 align:middle line:84%
their historical
companion for a while--

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:35.415 align:middle line:90%
to do this well.

00:09:35.415 --> 00:09:36.540 align:middle line:90%
But we're going to attempt.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.750 align:middle line:10%
So let's go back to
Burgundy and what

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.260 align:middle line:10%
was happening with Burgundy.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.870 align:middle line:10%
And from there, let's segue
into the Merovingian bloodline.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:45.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:47.090 align:middle line:84%
The time period
we're dealing with

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:50.690 align:middle line:84%
is about the end of the
10th century, 11th century.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.766 align:middle line:90%
And Europe is a complete mess.

00:09:52.766 --> 00:09:54.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's people
fighting all over the place.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:57.270 align:middle line:84%
It's an economy
based on plunder.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Even families are at
each other's throats.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:09:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Barbaric.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It was really barbaric.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And some of the things
that they were up to

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.380 align:middle line:84%
are kind of left
out and edited out.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.512 align:middle line:84%
Because it was entertaining,
but after a while

00:10:05.512 --> 00:10:06.470 align:middle line:90%
it gets a bit gruesome.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we'll get into
a couple of them just to kind

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.560 align:middle line:90%
of set the stage--

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Because it's fun.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.116 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --for color.

00:10:11.116 --> 00:10:12.072 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:10:12.072 --> 00:10:13.580 align:middle line:90%
A lot of color.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And basically, you had this
nucleus of productivity

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.609 align:middle line:84%
where intellectualism
was allowed to flourish.

00:10:20.609 --> 00:10:22.400 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of this
you've got the church

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.800 align:middle line:84%
that's now become the
main strongman of Europe,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.520 align:middle line:84%
trying to keep down
anything that's

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.990 align:middle line:90%
intellectual or spiritual.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Because they have a
monopoly on all that stuff.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.310 align:middle line:84%
They don't want anybody
else to compete.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly in Burgundy
you have this sort

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:36.960 align:middle line:84%
of modicum of
enlightenment going on,

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.420 align:middle line:84%
a renaissance in this
tiny, little county

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.250 align:middle line:90%
in what is today France.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And here you have the background
of all the people, all

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.770 align:middle line:84%
the families, that
do eventually become

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.860 align:middle line:84%
the main players of the
Templar drama, who are also,

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.690 align:middle line:84%
of course, related
to the Cistercians,

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.255 align:middle line:84%
who have yet to
come on the scene.

00:10:53.255 --> 00:10:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
people, when you

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.760 align:middle line:84%
start looking at the
alliances, and what

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.220 align:middle line:84%
they were doing in
Burgundy in that time,

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.910 align:middle line:84%
they're setting up centers of
education of enlightenment.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.390 align:middle line:90%
They were even working--

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.940 align:middle line:84%
they had Arabs and Hebrews
working side by side.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.350 align:middle line:90%
God help us.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was in
on the same thing.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.920 align:middle line:84%
They were looking for
something much more than

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.430 align:middle line:84%
was being provided for by
spiritual people at the time--

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.120 align:middle line:90%
religious people at the time.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So they're forming their
own little sort of bulwark

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.970 align:middle line:90%
against barbarity at the time.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of
all of this you also

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.260 align:middle line:84%
have people who are associated
with a very old bloodline

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.740 align:middle line:84%
called the Merovingians, who
are now traced all the way back

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.940 align:middle line:90%
to Sumeria.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And before that-- and we're
now talking a stretch of 6,000

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.230 align:middle line:90%
years--

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.691 align:middle line:84%
to the bloodline of the Scythian
culture, who was predominately

00:11:37.691 --> 00:11:39.690 align:middle line:84%
living around the Black
Sea, in what today would

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.030 align:middle line:90%
be a Transylvania and Bulgaria.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And there is a
connection to Dracula,

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.760 align:middle line:84%
which we might get into, but
it's a little of a sidestep.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.690 align:middle line:84%
So this bloodline apparently
came from a divine source.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.520 align:middle line:84%
It was said to come
originally from people

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.620 align:middle line:84%
who are half human,
half divine, that

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.520 align:middle line:84%
survived the huge catastrophe
on the face of the Earth 11,000

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.320 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And by intermarrying
within their own kind,

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.910 align:middle line:84%
they kept this bloodline pure
for the Sumerian bloodline,

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.440 align:middle line:90%
for the Troy bloodline.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And eventually they
got into Europe,

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.390 align:middle line:90%
and to the Merovingians.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.806 align:middle line:84%
And it literally-- the reason
why they wanted to keep this

00:12:13.806 --> 00:12:16.290 align:middle line:84%
bloodline pure is because
a lot of these rulers--

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.040 align:middle line:90%
and there was men and women--

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.360 align:middle line:84%
they were associated
with being great healers.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.410 align:middle line:90%
They had the ability to see far.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:27.489 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they had
the ability to be psychics.

00:12:27.489 --> 00:12:28.530 align:middle line:90%
They were great teachers.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.772 align:middle line:84%
They believed in improving
people's lot on the land.

00:12:30.772 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:84%
They would teach people
how to raise themselves

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:36.240 align:middle line:84%
from a very basic, then
sustainable level, to really

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.780 align:middle line:90%
empowering themselves.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.560 align:middle line:84%
So of course, in the middle of
all of this drudgery in Europe,

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.040 align:middle line:84%
and this extraordinary control
by the Catholic Church,

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.530 align:middle line:90%
this was like manna from heaven.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.470 align:middle line:84%
The Merovingians were
absolutely adored,

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.120 align:middle line:90%
as far as I can figure out.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's from this basis
that we get the central group

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.370 align:middle line:84%
of families in Burgundy that
then become the people who

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.120 align:middle line:84%
become the supporters
of the nation, Knights

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Templar, and all of
their people around it.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.220 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very complex story.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.300 align:middle line:84%
But it goes back
thousands of years

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.610 align:middle line:84%
to a plan that was
laid down before,

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:11.460 align:middle line:84%
that really it was nothing
more than just raising people

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.140 align:middle line:84%
from a state of barbarity
into being highly enlightened.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Kind of what we're
looking for today.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Well-- and I would even argue
the same players keep emerging

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.132 align:middle line:90%
over, and over, and over.

00:13:21.132 --> 00:13:22.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It makes you wonder.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, because I have--

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.090 align:middle line:84%
like most of the
planet, I'm very

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:84%
comfortable with the
notion of reincarnation.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And certain souls have
certain abilities and tasks

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:36.600 align:middle line:84%
that they carry forward
from time to time.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.700 align:middle line:90%
And certainly our DNA follow--

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.650 align:middle line:84%
our incarnation patterns
are affected by our DNA.

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:45.060 align:middle line:90%
And we follow DNA lineages.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, I think so.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if we're looking
at it through that lens that I

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.880 align:middle line:84%
look at it through,
we're looking at it

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.200 align:middle line:84%
as a continuation of knowledge
being inculcated on the planet

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Earth, from beings
that have probably

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.380 align:middle line:84%
been here well
toward the beginning,

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:05.670 align:middle line:84%
to try to continue to
enlighten during dark times.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And uphold certain
knowledge, and inculcate it

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:10.677 align:middle line:84%
into the population
wherever they incarnate.

00:14:10.677 --> 00:14:13.052 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like that was
the richest place to do this.

00:14:13.052 --> 00:14:14.052 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:14:14.052 --> 00:14:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And the more you go
into ancient myth,

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.416 align:middle line:84%
the more it becomes
obvious that there's

00:14:17.416 --> 00:14:18.727 align:middle line:90%
a pattern going on here.

00:14:18.727 --> 00:14:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's something I'm working
on at the moment as well.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Looking at myths from the
point of view of a very--

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:24.435 align:middle line:90%
extremely ancient culture.

00:14:24.435 --> 00:14:26.700 align:middle line:84%
It's going back to a
time before the flood.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.870 align:middle line:90%
So with the--

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.020 align:middle line:90%
11,000 years ago.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:29.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And there is
this recurring connection,

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.890 align:middle line:84%
this thread that runs
right in the center

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:38.430 align:middle line:84%
of this extraordinary place
we call Earth and humanity,

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.841 align:middle line:84%
which is a big playground
for creativity and stupidity.

00:14:41.841 --> 00:14:43.632 align:middle line:84%
And they kind of go
hand in hand down here.

00:14:43.632 --> 00:14:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when there's
too much stupidity,

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.410 align:middle line:84%
these same beings continue
coming back and saying,

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:48.640 align:middle line:90%
OK, guys.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.652 align:middle line:90%
Time to wake up again.

00:14:49.652 --> 00:14:50.985 align:middle line:90%
Let's see the little knowledge--

00:14:50.985 --> 00:14:51.221 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Been there.

00:14:51.221 --> 00:14:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --until you
screw it up again.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And they keep
changing their name.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.735 align:middle line:90%
It's like a big PR exercise.

00:14:55.735 --> 00:14:58.320 align:middle line:84%
It's just like, well, we can't
call ourselves that anymore,

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.819 align:middle line:84%
because we know what happened
when we called ourselves that.

00:15:00.819 --> 00:15:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Someone came along
and killed us all.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.890 align:middle line:84%
So we come back
again into the body,

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.555 align:middle line:84%
and we now go and call
ourselves something else.

00:15:07.555 --> 00:15:08.805 align:middle line:90%
So it's actually quite clever.

00:15:08.805 --> 00:15:09.971 align:middle line:90%
It's almost like a big joke.

00:15:09.971 --> 00:15:12.690 align:middle line:84%
If you just step away from the
historical angle, and see that,

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:13.490 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.840 align:middle line:84%
There are recurrences where
the same characters appear

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.180 align:middle line:84%
to be repeating themselves
again, and again, and again.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And again.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And following the
work of Michael Newton,

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:24.330 align:middle line:84%
the psychoanalyst in LA, who
wrote two of the best books

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.847 align:middle line:84%
on reincarnation and
life between lives--

00:15:26.847 --> 00:15:28.930 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about a
clinical psychologist that's

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:31.150 align:middle line:90%
really going to new-age stuff.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.210 align:middle line:90%
He's not into woo-woo.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:33.975 align:middle line:84%
He's a literal
clinical psychologist

00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:37.340 align:middle line:84%
that deals with drinking
problems, sexual addiction, all

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.140 align:middle line:90%
that stuff.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.220 align:middle line:90%
Sit on my couch.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.579 align:middle line:90%
We'll count to 10.

00:15:40.579 --> 00:15:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And when you come back to
one I will suggest something.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:43.910 align:middle line:90%
And you're cured.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.820 align:middle line:10%
And to his surprise,
the patients

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.620 align:middle line:10%
were describing
what was happening

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.590 align:middle line:10%
on the other side of the veil,
in-between lives, and also

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:51.470 align:middle line:10%
reincarnation.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.140 align:middle line:10%
And the next patient would
pick up the story, entranced.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:54.940 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:55.578 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: Extraordinary material.

00:15:55.578 --> 00:15:56.070 align:middle line:10%
And it's great relegation.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:57.370 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: It is extraordinary.

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And I've witnessed it, and
experienced it a great deal

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:03.070 align:middle line:84%
myself, as I had a
therapy clinic years ago.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:04.600 align:middle line:90%
And my specialty was regression.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, really?

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And yeah.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Because I started
seeing these problems

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:10.135 align:middle line:84%
kept continuing back with people
who were open and spontaneous.

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:12.370 align:middle line:84%
That they were suddenly
somewhere-- not

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:13.360 align:middle line:90%
where we were anyway.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.920 align:middle line:90%
Not at this period of time.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.950 align:middle line:84%
But you'd start seeing
something like what

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:21.800 align:middle line:84%
you were talking about, where
one person would come in

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:22.600 align:middle line:90%
with a--

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.180 align:middle line:84%
it's usually a common
malady of some kind.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And you start peeling
back the layers,

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.560 align:middle line:84%
and they pop back
to this other time.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a week or two, or a month
later, another person comes in.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Their story's
cross-validating that.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.890 align:middle line:90%
They don't know each other.

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.800 align:middle line:84%
This happens-- anyone that
does regression work sees this.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.790 align:middle line:84%
These stories-- you start
getting a very complex web,

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:46.270 align:middle line:84%
that actually starts reducing
to being able to discern.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:48.560 align:middle line:90%
Certain periods of history.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Certain things that were
happening at certain points

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.860 align:middle line:90%
on the planet at a given time.

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
cross-validation for this.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.020 align:middle line:84%
So I bring it up because I
couldn't look at your story

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.660 align:middle line:84%
without looking at
it through that lens.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.560 align:middle line:90%
Because it was just--

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I think
it's a good point.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.329 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --too familiar.

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:08.589 align:middle line:84%
And so if you take all of these,
pre-Diluvian times and such--

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:14.020 align:middle line:84%
again, back to the first
civilizations of Atlantis,

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:17.109 align:middle line:84%
the early Atlantean
civilizations-- technology

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:18.250 align:middle line:90%
was high.

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.780 align:middle line:90%
Initially very peaceful times.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.410 align:middle line:84%
You were talking about a
great understanding of all

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:25.420 align:middle line:90%
of these arts and sciences.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.899 align:middle line:90%
It didn't go away.

00:17:26.899 --> 00:17:29.315 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And it also ended up
in a very bad place as well.

00:17:29.315 --> 00:17:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They did end up--

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And it always ends
up going left in Albuquerque.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.036 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean
that's a long period of time.

00:17:34.036 --> 00:17:36.282 align:middle line:84%
And then if we understand
that history is also

00:17:36.282 --> 00:17:37.990 align:middle line:84%
running concurrently,
we don't understand

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.450 align:middle line:84%
the time frames of history
of our cultures right now.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:40.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, if
you look at Egypt,

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:45.640 align:middle line:84%
if it's true that Egypt actually
dates back 200,000 years,

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.020 align:middle line:90%
it was concurrent with Atlantis.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So this knowledge was
always being seeded.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.663 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There was
emigration all the time,

00:17:52.663 --> 00:17:56.060 align:middle line:84%
including to Burgundy,
ultimately Portugal.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:56.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.687 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Jerusalem.

00:17:58.687 --> 00:18:00.520 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk
modern history, which

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.890 align:middle line:90%
is just the last 1,000 years.

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:04.106 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you
actually take away

00:18:04.106 --> 00:18:06.580 align:middle line:84%
the names of the various
players, like the Templars,

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.380 align:middle line:84%
or the Essenes, or
the Cistercians,

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.630 align:middle line:84%
you find that they're
actually the same people.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.320 align:middle line:84%
You'd be talking about the
same people all the time.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.480 align:middle line:90%
They would dress the same way.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.620 align:middle line:90%
They behaved the same way.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.810 align:middle line:84%
They believed in the
same belief systems.

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:20.350 align:middle line:84%
They acted it towards a
certain predetermined goal.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.460 align:middle line:90%
You can't tell them apart.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.290 align:middle line:90%
So it seems to me that, yes--

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:26.260 align:middle line:84%
there is some part of me that
says, yes, there is something

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.330 align:middle line:84%
that as though these
people came back to finish

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.170 align:middle line:90%
a job from 1,000 years ago.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And that makes sense.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's a
pretty romantic idea,

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:32.290 align:middle line:90%
but it makes sense as well.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:34.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it's just
logical, in my opinion.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And also we have to add
into that blend the Celts

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.700 align:middle line:90%
and the Druids.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:41.500 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.457 align:middle line:84%
All part of the same
tree of knowledge.

00:18:43.457 --> 00:18:43.590 align:middle line:90%
Same branch.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.631 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All part of the
same tree of knowledge,

00:18:45.631 --> 00:18:48.100 align:middle line:84%
bringing forward the same
knowledge over and over

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:49.180 align:middle line:90%
when times are dark.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:49.510 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.134 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Or when times
are about to go dark,

00:18:52.134 --> 00:18:55.390 align:middle line:84%
to try to reestablish it
in the minds of people

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:56.590 align:middle line:90%
before the lights go out.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's these
cycles of consciousness.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.905 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they have other words
for it in other traditions.

00:19:01.905 --> 00:19:02.180 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Which is,
by the way, they

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.630 align:middle line:84%
keep changing their
names all the time.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.975 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:19:04.975 --> 00:19:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It's like a company.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:07.510 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, that
didn't work out so well.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Let's change our
name to something else.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:10.090 align:middle line:90%
That will work.

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:11.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.280 align:middle line:90%
So now let's return to--

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.260 align:middle line:84%
we've set up a little bit about
what was happening in Burgundy.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.630 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
we had some monks.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And there was the Order of Sion
that ultimately came to be.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Let's make some kind of--
draw some kind of line

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.340 align:middle line:84%
between these, and explain
who these monks were.

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And explain the
place they inhabited.

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And how this starts
figuring into the story.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Oh, the Order
of Sion was fascinating.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And I have to give credit to
Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln.

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:42.785 align:middle line:10%
Because they really
sort of found

00:19:42.785 --> 00:19:45.409 align:middle line:10%
that out when they were writing
"Holy Blood, Holy Grail," which

00:19:45.409 --> 00:19:47.260 align:middle line:10%
actually helped me a
lot in my understanding

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.897 align:middle line:10%
of bringing all these
confusing things together.

00:19:49.897 --> 00:19:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out that there was
a group of monks that suddenly

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.230 align:middle line:84%
moved from all the
way from Calabria,

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:55.840 align:middle line:90%
which is in southern Sicily.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.970 align:middle line:84%
They've moved all the
way up to Europe--

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:59.960 align:middle line:90%
not exactly easy back then--

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.280 align:middle line:84%
and they found themselves
in this particular place

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:07.090 align:middle line:84%
that was run by Canossa
Matilda the Tuscan.

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:09.372 align:middle line:84%
And basically she gave
them a plot of land.

00:20:09.372 --> 00:20:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
thank you very much.

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And they built themselves
a nice, little cathedral.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, about 20
years later, they just

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.510 align:middle line:90%
buggered off down to Jerusalem.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:21.400 align:middle line:84%
I was like, you just don't just
move halfway across Europe,

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.440 align:middle line:84%
build yourself a big
church, and then leave it,

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.715 align:middle line:84%
and go off 2,000 miles
to play somewhere else.

00:20:25.715 --> 00:20:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There's some
motivation, though, behind it.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:28.125 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Extraordinary
motivation.

00:20:28.125 --> 00:20:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.958 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And it
turns out that they

00:20:29.958 --> 00:20:33.180 align:middle line:84%
were grooming a very young
man, who, in time, would become

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:36.420 align:middle line:84%
the first patriarch of
Jerusalem, who then, in turn,

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:41.070 align:middle line:84%
installed the monks in the
rundown basilica on Mount Sion,

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:43.110 align:middle line:84%
where they became known
as the Order of Sion.

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:45.318 align:middle line:84%
And they were claiming that
all that they were saying

00:20:45.318 --> 00:20:47.760 align:middle line:84%
was, we have come back to
basically finish a job that

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.819 align:middle line:90%
was begun a long time ago.

00:20:49.819 --> 00:20:51.360 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
part of a bloodline

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.800 align:middle line:90%
that we're protecting here.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And a certain tradition
that we're protecting.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:57.955 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to bring
that back into play now

00:20:57.955 --> 00:20:59.830 align:middle line:84%
with the things that
are happening in Europe.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.310 align:middle line:84%
In our time, That
window of opportunity

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:05.550 align:middle line:84%
that has been missing for
1,000 years because of war,

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.380 align:middle line:84%
religious warfare, and
all of these things

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:09.570 align:middle line:84%
that have been going on,
this is the best moment

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.520 align:middle line:90%
we've ever had for 1,000 years.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very dramatic
moment in history,

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:16.950 align:middle line:84%
where suddenly this pent-up
frustration of bringing back

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:20.910 align:middle line:84%
a holy bloodline in Europe to
undermine the Catholic Church

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:21.900 align:middle line:90%
is now in play.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
the Templars also

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.229 align:middle line:84%
show up at the very same
moment in Jerusalem.

00:21:26.229 --> 00:21:28.770 align:middle line:84%
So you have these people sort
of going backwards and forwards

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.276 align:middle line:90%
between the two churches.

00:21:30.276 --> 00:21:31.650 align:middle line:10%
You have the monks
with the Order

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:33.900 align:middle line:10%
of Sion in their
little rundown basilica

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.730 align:middle line:10%
just outside the
gates of Jerusalem.

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And you have the nucleus of
what will become the Templar

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.260 align:middle line:90%
order in the Holy Sepulcher.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.070 align:middle line:90%
Talking backwards and forwards.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And there is actually a deed
that I found that shows that

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:50.080 align:middle line:84%
the Piieuré of Sion is actually
interacting with Hugues de

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Payens, the leader
of the Templars.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And saying that good relations
exist between our two orders.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.422 align:middle line:84%
Now this is at least 10 years
before the Templars have

00:21:58.422 --> 00:21:59.880 align:middle line:84%
been made official,
which shows you

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.220 align:middle line:84%
if they're saying that
there's an organization,

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:05.550 align:middle line:84%
or a good relationship
between the two orders,

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:07.260 align:middle line:84%
the Order of Sion
and the Templar Order

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.660 align:middle line:84%
must already have been
existing as early as 1104.

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, and this says--

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:13.761 align:middle line:84%
one of the documents
I noticed in your book

00:22:13.761 --> 00:22:16.955 align:middle line:84%
said the Order of Sion--
it was founded in 1090.

00:22:16.955 --> 00:22:17.955 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Quite possibly.

00:22:17.955 --> 00:22:18.913 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Even earlier.

00:22:18.913 --> 00:22:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So this changes
the historical record

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.650 align:middle line:84%
in terms of when the
Templars even came to be.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.840 align:middle line:84%
So this was all
mounting long before

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.200 align:middle line:84%
the common historical
records recognize.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.491 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the best
things that my history teacher

00:22:34.491 --> 00:22:35.814 align:middle line:90%
taught me when I was 11.

00:22:35.814 --> 00:22:37.879 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that stayed
in my head in school

00:22:37.879 --> 00:22:39.420 align:middle line:84%
was the fact that
if you want to look

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.240 align:middle line:84%
at the true story behind
anything in history,

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.470 align:middle line:90%
go back 50 years.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Because that's when
things really begin

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.295 align:middle line:90%
to rise out of the ground.

00:22:47.295 --> 00:22:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's rise.

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: The root of things.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:49.360 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And that's
what I basically did.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.940 align:middle line:84%
I said, how far back
can I take this?

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And yes, you had these
monks that moved suddenly

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.789 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of nowhere, to
the other middle of nowhere,

00:22:57.789 --> 00:23:00.330 align:middle line:84%
to establish a relationship with
a young boy who then becomes

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:01.560 align:middle line:90%
the patriarch of Jerusalem.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And In the meantime, you
have all the founding players

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:06.870 align:middle line:84%
of the Templars making
family connections

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:07.920 align:middle line:90%
in that part of Europe.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And making friends with the
monks, or making friends

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:14.160 align:middle line:84%
with other influential people,
who, them, in 20 years--

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.426 align:middle line:84%
and they were in no hurry
to do this, by the way.

00:23:16.426 --> 00:23:16.760 align:middle line:90%
20 years later--

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:17.860 align:middle line:90%
Long-term thinking.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.915 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --the players
suddenly come together

00:23:19.915 --> 00:23:22.000 align:middle line:90%
in a fortuitous moment in time.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.077 align:middle line:84%
So it's a beautiful plan, but
they were very, very patient.

00:23:25.077 --> 00:23:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there's one
thing, as you just said.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.910 align:middle line:84%
This kind of an
uninhabitable land almost.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:31.920 align:middle line:90%
I mean, rough land.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Not the prime
picking, so to speak.

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:36.210 align:middle line:84%
This keeps coming
up again and again

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:38.550 align:middle line:90%
throughout the Templar story--

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.280 align:middle line:84%
is when they're offered
vast tracts of land,

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.917 align:middle line:84%
that they would often choose
what appeared to be subpar--

00:23:43.917 --> 00:23:44.875 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Very had ones.

00:23:44.875 --> 00:23:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --really bad lands.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.850 align:middle line:90%
They'd choose the bad lands.

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And again, now let's
go back to Sion.

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:54.060 align:middle line:84%
Because now we get into the
story of telluric energy.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.290 align:middle line:90%
Ley lines.

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Energy rising from
certain areas that

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.540 align:middle line:84%
make certain states of
consciousness possible,

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:04.660 align:middle line:84%
that are desirable to
build certain edifices on.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.590 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to
that-- as you say,

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:09.700 align:middle line:90%
kind of rundown basilica.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:10.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a very strange
situation, where

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:14.490 align:middle line:84%
you have the guy that's
now running Jerusalem--

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
talk about that.

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Brigands
are running around.

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:19.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of annoyed Arabs
running around, because they've

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:21.940 align:middle line:90%
just lost their capital.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:24.060 align:middle line:84%
So of course, they're
going to try and get it.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.760 align:middle line:90%
So what does the patriarch do?

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.560 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Instead of living in the really
safe haven inside the walls

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.440 align:middle line:84%
of the city, I'm
going to take refuge

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.820 align:middle line:84%
in a rundown basilica
outside the walls

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.900 align:middle line:84%
to the place where we
can be basically killed.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:36.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It doesn't
make any sense.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.593 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you go back
in history and you find out--

00:24:40.593 --> 00:24:42.600 align:middle line:84%
and we're now talking
thousands of years--

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.320 align:middle line:84%
of the continuous
creation of temples,

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and sacred buildings
in specific hot spots.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And we now know today, by
matching myth, tradition,

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.770 align:middle line:84%
and technology, that all of
these ancient sacred sites

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:58.920 align:middle line:84%
are all built on the earth's
electromagnetic pathways.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Specifically the
junction points.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:84%
What we call node points,
or even navels of the Earth,

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:05.220 align:middle line:90%
if you want to go that far.

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And these hot spots
have the ability

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:08.910 align:middle line:90%
to alter human consciousness.

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:10.960 align:middle line:90%
This is now a proven fact.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.140 align:middle line:84%
We can even measure the
energy that we don't feel,

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:13.996 align:middle line:90%
that we can see.

00:25:13.996 --> 00:25:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
these places were

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:17.590 align:middle line:84%
very important to
this group of people.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.830 align:middle line:84%
Because when you follow
the Templars story, even

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:22.080 align:middle line:84%
the Cistercian story,
the other group

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.930 align:middle line:84%
that were fundamentally
behind the Templars,

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:26.945 align:middle line:84%
they always chose these
very unusual locations.

00:25:26.945 --> 00:25:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And when you go
and look at where

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.570 align:middle line:84%
they built their
buildings, yes, there

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.950 align:middle line:84%
is something very
telluric about them.

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:34.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a different
feel about them.

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's what was part of
this spiritual technology

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.449 align:middle line:84%
that they were
trying to rediscover.

00:25:39.449 --> 00:25:40.740 align:middle line:90%
They weren't looking for money.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.140 align:middle line:84%
They were looking for a
spiritual treasure, something

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.160 align:middle line:84%
that would help them overcome
the problems of the period,

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.520 align:middle line:90%
which of course is barbarity.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.100 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to-- they
can rise up the spirits

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.730 align:middle line:90%
to come forward again.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.810 align:middle line:84%
So they would choose really
inhospitable places that

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:59.070 align:middle line:84%
used to be temple places,
or sacred places that had

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.780 align:middle line:90%
been run down because of war.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.520 align:middle line:84%
So it starts to
make sense when you

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.012 align:middle line:84%
start seeing the picture from
the bigger point of view.

00:26:05.012 --> 00:26:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And why they went
through so much trouble

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.520 align:middle line:84%
to find places that,
frankly, I wouldn't

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.940 align:middle line:90%
give $0.05 for this building.

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:11.272 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: But I
want that building.

00:26:11.272 --> 00:26:11.354 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:26:11.354 --> 00:26:11.600 align:middle line:90%
Because it worked.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And some of them
had not been developed before.

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:14.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet
they understood

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.480 align:middle line:84%
the nature of what the
land itself was about.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Although to the outside
world it would look like,

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:22.992 align:middle line:90%
oh, these humble ascetics.

00:26:22.992 --> 00:26:24.450 align:middle line:84%
They'll eschew the
palace they were

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:27.550 align:middle line:84%
given for this badlands
track of dirt over here.

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:28.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I know.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:30.545 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And in fact, that
was just a public perception.

00:26:30.545 --> 00:26:30.970 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:32.265 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just out of humility.

00:26:32.265 --> 00:26:33.700 align:middle line:84%
It's they knew
what was going on.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I know.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet, no
one else did around them.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:37.230 align:middle line:90%
Not the Royalty.

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:38.030 align:middle line:90%
Not the church.

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:40.150 align:middle line:84%
No one around them
knew what was going on.

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:41.653 align:middle line:84%
They didn't possess
that knowledge.

00:26:41.653 --> 00:26:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I mean,
they were humble,

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.230 align:middle line:90%
but they also went beyond that.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's exactly--

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Given the choice
between having a bed of straw,

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.210 align:middle line:84%
now they will live in a hovel
underneath the staircase.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:48.570 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to
talk about those characters

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:50.730 align:middle line:90%
in a minute.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:51.610 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:52.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing
was that particular abbey--

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.460 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to find this
out throughout the story--

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.830 align:middle line:84%
the great days where
documents were signed,

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:06.330 align:middle line:84%
or campaigns were begun,
often, or many times,

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:09.870 align:middle line:84%
were in honor of the feast day
of either John the Baptist,

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.370 align:middle line:90%
or Mary Magdalene.

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:16.080 align:middle line:84%
So all of it seemed to hook
back into a period 1,000 years

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.550 align:middle line:90%
earlier, and the bloodline?

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:17.800 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that abbey was
dedicated to John the Baptist,

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:21.710 align:middle line:90%
as I recall.

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:22.870 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: The one in Mount Sion?

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.464 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: To Mary.

00:27:25.464 --> 00:27:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that was Mary.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:27.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:27.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:28.005 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:27:28.005 --> 00:27:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's
talk about that.

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: The other one
was actually-- yeah.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:36.120 align:middle line:84%
There was a place also where
the Knights of St. John

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.910 align:middle line:84%
were in Jerusalem, which you'd
think has to do with John

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:39.760 align:middle line:90%
the Baptist.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.676 align:middle line:90%
But actually it's not.

00:27:40.676 --> 00:27:43.350 align:middle line:84%
It's to do with St. John
[INAUDIBLE] of Cyprus,

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:45.470 align:middle line:84%
who also gave up his
wealth to become--

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:45.665 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:27:45.665 --> 00:27:45.730 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Poorer of spirit.

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:48.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean poor of pocket.

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
go back to Our Lady.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Chapels being dedicated
all over to Our Lady.

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:55.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:56.880 align:middle line:90%
And again, the bloodline.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And how these people that
gathered at that rundown abbey

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.880 align:middle line:90%
were affiliated with that.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:04.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm surprised that
no-one's picked up

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.570 align:middle line:84%
on this, even a lot of
the Templar historians.

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:09.210 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody
equates the Templars

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:10.740 align:middle line:90%
with the Catholic Church.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:14.110 align:middle line:84%
But they never dedicated any
of their buildings to Jesus.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:14.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Doesn't that
sort a little bit odd?

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I found interesting.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.768 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Alarm bells should
be ringing at this point.

00:28:18.768 --> 00:28:19.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:22.602 align:middle line:10%
>>SILVA: For example, in
Portugal, where the Templars--

00:28:22.602 --> 00:28:24.060 align:middle line:10%
we'll talk about
this in a second--

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.950 align:middle line:10%
where they created the
country, every single thing

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.090 align:middle line:10%
that they built was dedicated
to Mary Magdalene and John

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:28.580 align:middle line:10%
the Baptist.

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:31.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Setting up all
of their civil calendars

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.510 align:middle line:90%
on the feast day of either.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:36.660 align:middle line:84%
There's something that
should be looked at here.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.070 align:middle line:90%
And it was the same thing--

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:40.980 align:middle line:84%
whether it was in Jerusalem,
in France, and in Portugal,

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.530 align:middle line:84%
they were always
following this connection.

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:45.429 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that when you start

00:28:45.429 --> 00:28:47.970 align:middle line:84%
looking at the lineage going
all the way back, that they were

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:50.520 align:middle line:90%
protecting a certain bloodline.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the things that I

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:54.600 align:middle line:90%
was amazed during my research.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.670 align:middle line:90%
I came across this--

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:59.040 align:middle line:84%
actually, it was a
massive, massive book.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.570 align:middle line:90%
It was so big.

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:01.460 align:middle line:90%
About that thick.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.180 align:middle line:90%
No index, of course.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.130 align:middle line:84%
So I wasn't quite sure
what I was looking for.

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:08.850 align:middle line:84%
But somewhere on page 680
there is a swearing-in ceremony

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:11.250 align:middle line:84%
of the grand master of
the Templars in Portugal

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.930 align:middle line:84%
that declares to protect
the bloodline of David.

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're not going to
put that in the swearing-in

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.080 align:middle line:84%
ceremony unless they're
there to protect a bloodline.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.170 align:middle line:84%
So one of the central
themes of the Order of Sion,

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:24.120 align:middle line:90%
who basically the people that--

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.100 align:middle line:84%
I won't say bankrolled
the Templars,

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.620 align:middle line:84%
but they were
certainly fundamental

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.490 align:middle line:84%
in creating the
original Templars.

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
Templars, apparently,

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:33.330 align:middle line:84%
were also members of
the Order of Sion.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:35.520 align:middle line:10%
And that was revealed
in secret dossiers

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:40.220 align:middle line:10%
that were found by Henry
Lincoln and company in Paris.

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:43.500 align:middle line:10%
And that these documents that
were put there deliberately

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.590 align:middle line:10%
showed that the Templars
and the Order of Sion

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:48.030 align:middle line:10%
basically were the same people.

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:51.460 align:middle line:84%
Or that the two organizations
were so intertwined.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And the Order of Sion's
declared aim was always

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:58.260 align:middle line:84%
that we are here to resuscitate
the bloodline of David.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And also the bloodline that
was split from the Sumerian

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:03.150 align:middle line:84%
culture, through the
Egyptian culture,

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:05.520 align:middle line:84%
and eventually find its
way into central Europe.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:09.480 align:middle line:84%
This is the rightful bloodline
of the divine kings and queens,

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.730 align:middle line:84%
who were leading people
up from the ground.

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.410 align:middle line:84%
To give them a ladder
up in the state of life,

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.680 align:middle line:84%
which is what the Catholic
Church wasn't doing.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Because they supported
the Carolingians.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And the Carolingians,
essentially

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.300 align:middle line:84%
had a big coup in
the middle of Europe.

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.550 align:middle line:84%
They had basically run down
the Merovingian bloodline,

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:28.050 align:middle line:90%
and drove it underground.

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Because they held
the biggest secret

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:32.460 align:middle line:84%
of all, which was the true
story of what was happening

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.830 align:middle line:84%
with the true Christian
brotherhood of Jesus,

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:middle line:84%
Mary Magdalene, the fact
that they were married,

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.048 align:middle line:84%
the fact that there's a
family relationship with John

00:30:39.048 --> 00:30:41.450 align:middle line:84%
the Baptist, which to this
day the church has denied.

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Because they even denied the
fact that John the Baptist even

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:46.380 align:middle line:84%
wrote a book, which
is a bit inconvenient,

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:50.057 align:middle line:84%
because the Mandaeans which live
today in southern Iraq, saying,

00:30:50.057 --> 00:30:52.140 align:middle line:84%
we are the original followers
of John the Baptist.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:53.940 align:middle line:90%
And we still read from his book.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.090 align:middle line:84%
Because he was the true
Christian brotherhood.

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:56.240 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was a mystic.

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:58.130 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:59.580 align:middle line:90%
He was the priestly messiah.

00:30:59.580 --> 00:30:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And the bloodline
was always with the priest.

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Whether it was a
man or a woman--

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.420 align:middle line:84%
doesn't matter-- the bloodline
stayed with the woman.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:11.280 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes the priestly
portion of the bloodline

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.780 align:middle line:90%
would be a man or a woman.

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.580 align:middle line:90%
But Jesus was the king version.

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.960 align:middle line:84%
He was almost like the PR
version, the front man.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And that everything else
was done behind the scenes

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.559 align:middle line:90%
not to attract attention.

00:31:20.559 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:84%
The church couldn't
have that, because they

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:25.560 align:middle line:84%
base their version of events
on Jesus being a messiah.

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.480 align:middle line:84%
That's where they
got it really wrong.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And since then they've
been backpedaling,

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.910 align:middle line:84%
trying to hide and
cover up the story

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:34.170 align:middle line:84%
that it was the lineage
of the Magdalene

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:35.720 align:middle line:90%
that was more important.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And hence, there are where
the Templars come in.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.260 align:middle line:84%
They suddenly come
into this section, work

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.240 align:middle line:84%
with the Order of Sion,
and the two of them

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.250 align:middle line:84%
were trying to
resuscitate this bloodline

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:46.902 align:middle line:84%
to bring back the spirituality
of people in Europe.

00:31:46.902 --> 00:31:48.860 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the reasons
why the church wants

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:50.090 align:middle line:90%
to do away with them.

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:51.870 align:middle line:84%
And that starts to
make a lot of sense.

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It does
make a lot of sense.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Why was the
church so against them?

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:54.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
because now,

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.920 align:middle line:84%
even in common-day
thinking about--

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.160 align:middle line:84%
and especially in conspiracy
circles about bloodlines,

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.220 align:middle line:84%
it's immediately given
a dark connotation,

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:06.930 align:middle line:84%
as though there's
something to hide.

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:08.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a controlling force.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.130 align:middle line:84%
It's never given the
benefit of having

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:14.610 align:middle line:84%
been a bloodline through which
these entities can incarnate,

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:16.281 align:middle line:84%
to start uplifting
again and again.

00:32:16.281 --> 00:32:18.530 align:middle line:84%
That keeps being pasted over
with these other stories.

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Kind of
extraordinary, isn't it?

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.163 align:middle line:90%
But the evidence is there.

00:32:21.163 --> 00:32:23.790 align:middle line:84%
You go all the way back
to the House of Troy.

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you go further back to
Sumeria, where the bloodline--

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, the original
mention of the Grail

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:32.337 align:middle line:84%
appears in Sumeria,
in the song of Inanna.

00:32:32.337 --> 00:32:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And you start looking
at the priestesses who

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:35.610 align:middle line:90%
are protecting the bloodline.

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And they wore the
red robe of office.

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:41.250 align:middle line:84%
So the priestesses had the
highest level of officialdom

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:44.120 align:middle line:84%
in-- let's call it "religion,"
for the sake of a better word.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.786 align:middle line:84%
I don't like using
"religion" because it

00:32:45.786 --> 00:32:48.350 align:middle line:84%
has all kinds of
negative connotations.

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:50.070 align:middle line:84%
I'll say it's
spiritual religion.

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And the priestesses
had the highest role

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.570 align:middle line:90%
in the actual temple.

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Because they were in
charge of initiations

00:32:56.790 --> 00:33:00.662 align:middle line:84%
to do with the raising of
a personal spirituality.

00:33:00.662 --> 00:33:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was part of a ritual
called the raising of the dead,

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.370 align:middle line:84%
or the living resurrection
as they called it.

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And so the women wore
the red robe of office,

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:11.400 align:middle line:84%
called "ritus," which is what
we get the word "rituals" from.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.930 align:middle line:90%
And it was a red robe.

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:15.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's where the concept
of the woman in red comes in.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.225 align:middle line:84%
So fast forward 3,000 years
late with Mary Magdalene,

00:33:18.225 --> 00:33:21.480 align:middle line:84%
with the woman wearing the
red robe, what happens to her?

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.430 align:middle line:84%
She gets basically
mislabeled as a prostitute.

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Since then, we've been
having a problem with women

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:26.430 align:middle line:90%
wearing the color red.

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:26.835 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:26.835 --> 00:33:26.970 align:middle line:90%
Jezebel.

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:27.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So the whole thing
has turned on its head,

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:31.536 align:middle line:84%
because they were trying
to basically put this whole

00:33:31.536 --> 00:33:35.670 align:middle line:84%
concept of the women priests
who were carrying this bloodline

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:38.610 align:middle line:84%
for the development of
the personal spirituality,

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:40.570 align:middle line:84%
and a personal
connection with God--

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:42.900 align:middle line:84%
not through a priest,
but through a priest

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:44.970 align:middle line:84%
helping the individual
find themselves,

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:45.862 align:middle line:90%
and that connection.

00:33:45.862 --> 00:33:46.662 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Again.

00:33:46.662 --> 00:33:47.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And that was
what was very important.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.010 align:middle line:90%
The church was all against that.

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:52.051 align:middle line:84%
There's a bunch of guys
who said, oh, no, no, no.

00:33:52.051 --> 00:33:53.100 align:middle line:90%
We can't have that.

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.870 align:middle line:84%
We have a job
creation scheme here.

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:55.980 align:middle line:90%
We want to do that.

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And if we've people find
their own spirituality,

00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:59.481 align:middle line:90%
well, we're out of a job.

00:33:59.481 --> 00:34:00.480 align:middle line:90%
It's really that simple.

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.410 align:middle line:90%
That's what it comes down to.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is that simple.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:02.870 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:03.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:06.660 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to kind
of move away from Sion.

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.630 align:middle line:84%
But the root word
"tzion--" T, right?

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:14.190 align:middle line:84%
T-Z-I-O-N is-- and this caught
me in the book as well--

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:17.639 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual point from
which all reality emerges.

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:18.734 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yup.

00:34:18.734 --> 00:34:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now how
does that concept then

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.110 align:middle line:90%
play into what you just said?

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:25.469 align:middle line:84%
Again, bringing these
telluric points together,

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:28.479 align:middle line:84%
these people coming to these
places with this knowledge.

00:34:28.479 --> 00:34:29.279 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:34:29.279 --> 00:34:30.079 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh.

00:34:30.079 --> 00:34:31.530 align:middle line:90%
The Sion is fascinating.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:33.949 align:middle line:84%
You find this
throughout Arabic text,

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:36.300 align:middle line:84%
throughout early Christian
text, Mandaean text.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.900 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was talking about it.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's discussed as
a kind of cornerstone,

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:44.260 align:middle line:84%
which has to be the cornerstone
of the actual temple, which

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:46.234 align:middle line:84%
literally forms the
foundation of the temple.

00:34:46.234 --> 00:34:47.650 align:middle line:84%
But what they were
talking about--

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and they always talk in
metaphors and symbols

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:51.540 align:middle line:84%
in these moments,
which is where we

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.150 align:middle line:84%
get in some really deep
arguments about what's

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:55.339 align:middle line:90%
right and wrong.

00:34:55.339 --> 00:34:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Once you start looking
at this information,

00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:59.130 align:middle line:90%
literally, you've lost the plot.

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:01.650 align:middle line:84%
All of these people, in
order to protect themselves

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:03.940 align:middle line:84%
and the truthfulness of what
they were trying to say,

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:05.610 align:middle line:84%
they veiled everything
as a metaphor.

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:07.410 align:middle line:84%
So Sion was essentially
the metaphor

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:09.576 align:middle line:84%
for the sort of creation
of the universe.

00:35:09.576 --> 00:35:10.950 align:middle line:84%
The central point
in the universe

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:12.510 align:middle line:90%
from where all life starts.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And from there,
once you understand

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:17.176 align:middle line:84%
what that point does, you're
now in a very even platform.

00:35:17.176 --> 00:35:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Because if you understand
the creative points

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:22.770 align:middle line:84%
of the sort of creation,
in all of its multiplicity,

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:24.570 align:middle line:84%
now you can figure out
how everything else

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:26.190 align:middle line:90%
falls into place.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:28.980 align:middle line:84%
If we don't understand that
you are clutching at straws.

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.230 align:middle line:84%
You're getting something is
right, something is wrong.

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:34.070 align:middle line:84%
So the points associated
with the concept of Sion

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:37.680 align:middle line:84%
become literally the hot spots,
where this creative energy

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.405 align:middle line:84%
manifest on the
face of the Earth.

00:35:39.405 --> 00:35:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that science now knows.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.946 align:middle line:84%
That there are certain
spots on the face

00:35:42.946 --> 00:35:46.960 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth where energy and
gravity behaves very subtly

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:47.760 align:middle line:90%
different.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:49.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And that has
an effect on your body.

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:51.936 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So once you
connect with that energy,

00:35:51.936 --> 00:35:54.664 align:middle line:84%
now you have become in contact
with the concept of Sion, which

00:35:54.664 --> 00:35:56.580 align:middle line:84%
is the central point of
creating the universe.

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately,
we're not that distant

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:01.100 align:middle line:84%
from the creative
center of life.

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a concept that
we here on Earth

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:05.280 align:middle line:84%
are so far away from the
center of the universe.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.050 align:middle line:90%
But we're not, really.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Physics now knows that if you
can find the right wormhole

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.767 align:middle line:84%
you can be there in
a blink of an eye.

00:36:11.767 --> 00:36:13.350 align:middle line:84%
So that's what they
were tapping into.

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:15.690 align:middle line:84%
A very old sort of
wisdom and understanding.

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Of allowing you, as a physical
body, to leave that body,

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.810 align:middle line:84%
connect with the final
level of reality,

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:24.690 align:middle line:84%
and connect with a source where
you can actually understand

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:25.980 align:middle line:90%
how things truly are.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.840 align:middle line:90%
Not how they're perceived.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.512 align:middle line:84%
That's what religion
does, you see?

00:36:29.512 --> 00:36:31.470 align:middle line:84%
You get to the point of
the counter perception.

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:34.011 align:middle line:84%
And you get into arguments, and
then you kill people over it.

00:36:34.011 --> 00:36:35.880 align:middle line:84%
But if you understand
what the true concept

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.060 align:middle line:84%
of the point of
creation is about,

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:40.237 align:middle line:84%
and what science
stands for, now you're

00:36:40.237 --> 00:36:41.320 align:middle line:90%
really learning something.

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.640 align:middle line:90%
You're way ahead of the curve.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.690 align:middle line:90%
I found that fascinating.

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: That's amazing.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:45.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:48.441 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to just side-track
a little, tiny bubble

00:36:48.441 --> 00:36:50.940 align:middle line:84%
of a story I may have mentioned
before, because now maybe it

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:51.740 align:middle line:90%
makes more sense.

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:52.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:53.640 align:middle line:90%
John the Baptist.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:56.790 align:middle line:84%
He is credited at
this point in history

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:59.820 align:middle line:84%
from hailing from a little
town called Ein Karem outside

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:00.660 align:middle line:90%
of Jerusalem, right?

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Mm-hmm.

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:02.013 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Up in the hills.

00:37:02.013 --> 00:37:03.310 align:middle line:90%
And he was known to be a rebel.

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:04.550 align:middle line:10%
He was known to be a mystic.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:05.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: He was a punk.

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:06.405 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He was a punk.

00:37:06.405 --> 00:37:09.870 align:middle line:84%
He was known also to be a loner,
and had great, vast stretches

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:11.730 align:middle line:90%
of time and vision alone.

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And he is credited
with, of course,

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:17.800 align:middle line:84%
the work he did in terms of the
initiations, baptismal well.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.395 align:middle line:84%
But also, his seeing And
there's a little cave there

00:37:20.395 --> 00:37:21.195 align:middle line:90%
in Ein Karem.

00:37:21.195 --> 00:37:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And there is now a monastery
built around all of this.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.060 align:middle line:10%
I went into the monastery,
went into the cave.

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:29.860 align:middle line:84%
I had an experience that-- and
I've mentioned this before--

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.160 align:middle line:84%
one of the top few
experiences of my life.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.480 align:middle line:90%
Unexpected.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:37.110 align:middle line:84%
This incredible download with
these archetypal characters.

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:40.940 align:middle line:84%
All this was coming through from
the Egyptian period of time,

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:41.740 align:middle line:90%
though.

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:42.541 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Hmm.

00:37:42.541 --> 00:37:44.665 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which again--
you already mentioned that.

00:37:44.665 --> 00:37:46.260 align:middle line:90%
We're hopscotching through time.

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.390 align:middle line:84%
That was thousands
of years prior,

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:52.590 align:middle line:84%
depending on the dynasty,
to John the Baptist.

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.630 align:middle line:90%
1,000, 2,000 years prior to him.

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:56.400 align:middle line:90%
So again, hopscotching through.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And I was downloaded with
massive amounts of symbolism

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.620 align:middle line:84%
and information
from Egyptian times,

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:03.360 align:middle line:84%
sitting in John
the Baptist's cave.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Shocked
down to my tootsies.

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.819 align:middle line:90%
Like what is going on here?

00:38:07.819 --> 00:38:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I know exactly
what you're saying.

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:10.590 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:12.506 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: This is why
these places were chosen.

00:38:12.506 --> 00:38:13.590 align:middle line:90%
They're just not a cave.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:16.139 align:middle line:84%
It's a specific place
on the mountain where

00:38:16.139 --> 00:38:18.180 align:middle line:84%
the laws of physics are
slightly different to get

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:19.672 align:middle line:90%
you to have that experience.

00:38:19.672 --> 00:38:21.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just sat down
and it was happening.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.120 align:middle line:90%
It's so prominent in that area.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Again, opening into
these other periods,

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:27.620 align:middle line:90%
and these other energies.

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:28.420 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I think he's the most
important person in the Bible,

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:31.276 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:38:31.276 --> 00:38:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And so little time--
it's funny how so little

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:34.680 align:middle line:90%
is devoted to this guy.

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.612 align:middle line:84%
And yet, he's so
huge, so prominent,

00:38:36.612 --> 00:38:38.070 align:middle line:84%
in the whole, big
scheme of things.

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And all the peoples
around the era

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:42.356 align:middle line:84%
of the time of the
gnostic Christians--

00:38:42.356 --> 00:38:44.980 align:middle line:84%
which is what I was also part of
the understanding of the book,

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.430 align:middle line:84%
which was why were the gnostic
Christians being killed

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:48.300 align:middle line:90%
by the Catholics.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Although fundamentalist
Christians

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:52.290 align:middle line:84%
that there were at the time
didn't make any sense, well,

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:55.104 align:middle line:84%
the gnostic Christians, and all
the other sects of the period,

00:38:55.104 --> 00:38:56.520 align:middle line:84%
all believed that
John the Baptist

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.070 align:middle line:90%
was the man to go look at that.

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.720 align:middle line:84%
He's following a
very old tradition.

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:04.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, his name,
Johannes, goes all the way,

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:07.020 align:middle line:84%
etymologically, back
to Oannes, who is one

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:08.820 align:middle line:90%
of the created gods of Sumeria.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:11.280 align:middle line:84%
The fish man-- half
man, half fish.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And what were they
interested in?

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:15.280 align:middle line:84%
The first portion of
your initiation ceremony

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.900 align:middle line:84%
is ritual baptism through a
very special type of water.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.000 align:middle line:84%
There's something
potent about this water.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And where John the Baptist
did his ceremonies was

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:25.160 align:middle line:84%
in a place called the
place of crossing,

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.060 align:middle line:84%
where there is four
rivers across--

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.830 align:middle line:90%
on this sacred mount--

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:31.440 align:middle line:84%
and where the telluric
lines of the Earth

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.830 align:middle line:90%
also are granted to that water.

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:36.030 align:middle line:84%
That's something that
NASA discovered recently--

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:37.904 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth's magnetic
lines are attracted

00:39:37.904 --> 00:39:40.110 align:middle line:84%
to certain parts
of the world where

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:42.760 align:middle line:84%
a specific type of water--
a very clear and clean type

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.010 align:middle line:90%
of water-- exists.

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.350 align:middle line:84%
So it builds up this
numinous energy,

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:49.170 align:middle line:84%
which then develops a numinous
state of quality within you.

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:51.039 align:middle line:84%
So he was following
a very old tradition

00:39:51.039 --> 00:39:53.580 align:middle line:84%
of manipulation of energy, you
know, for a spiritual purpose.

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:53.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:54.935 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:39:54.935 --> 00:39:56.810 align:middle line:84%
That still exists to
this day, I would argue.

00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:58.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I find it fascinating.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to hop
through a little bit

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:06.780 align:middle line:84%
of the history of the region,
and the Moors who had invaded.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, the
living conditions.

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And then the rag-tag
assembly of people

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.640 align:middle line:90%
that became the "crusade."

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.065 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, my God.

00:40:16.065 --> 00:40:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so, we talk
about poor, ignorant.

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:22.140 align:middle line:90%
Talk about bloody.

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:25.630 align:middle line:84%
So I would like you to launch
into the Palestinian story.

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:30.570 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the Arabs
invaded Palestine.

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:32.184 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like in
the seventh century.

00:40:32.184 --> 00:40:33.600 align:middle line:84%
So you take it
forward from there,

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.790 align:middle line:84%
and set the stage for
what was going on.

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:38.370 align:middle line:84%
All these people
from Portugal over

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:41.430 align:middle line:84%
were basically on the
defensive the whole time,

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:44.970 align:middle line:84%
because the Arabs had made
such incredible progress

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:47.220 align:middle line:90%
into their lands.

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Exactly.

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And then it got more complicated
because the Arabs are

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:51.597 align:middle line:90%
fighting amongst themselves.

00:40:51.597 --> 00:40:53.680 align:middle line:84%
I believe there was just
this mass-- it was almost

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.830 align:middle line:90%
like a Monty Python thing.

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:55.090 align:middle line:90%
It's so funny.

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:57.436 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just give us a
massive movement of Arabs,

00:40:57.436 --> 00:40:58.560 align:middle line:90%
and where they had come in.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:01.350 align:middle line:84%
Starting in the seventh
century, or even before,

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:04.515 align:middle line:84%
what their movement
basically resulted in,

00:41:04.515 --> 00:41:06.980 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the takeover
of certain lands and such.

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:09.371 align:middle line:84%
They began to basically
fight amongst themselves.

00:41:09.371 --> 00:41:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And eventually the Sljuq
Turks became the top dogs

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:15.560 align:middle line:90%
in the situation.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.344 align:middle line:84%
And they were
particularly barbaric.

00:41:17.344 --> 00:41:18.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these were
barbaric times,

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.630 align:middle line:84%
but they were
particularly barbaric.

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:23.869 align:middle line:84%
So I had to edit a
lot of the stuff out.

00:41:23.869 --> 00:41:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And so you had this
sort of fighting that--

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:28.440 align:middle line:84%
this tide that goes in and
out between different factions

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.760 align:middle line:90%
of people.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Especially around the Balkans,
and around Constantinople,

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:36.390 align:middle line:84%
where the actual territory
is always shifting hands,

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:38.920 align:middle line:84%
accordingly, from one
decade to the other.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.410 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes even less.

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:42.390 align:middle line:84%
You'd be getting invaded
by different armies

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:44.681 align:middle line:84%
of different people with
different beliefs almost every

00:41:44.681 --> 00:41:45.630 align:middle line:90%
other week.

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:47.250 align:middle line:90%
It became so confusing.

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:51.990 align:middle line:84%
So after a while, what happened
was that the Sljuq Turks really

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:54.960 align:middle line:84%
sort of took over
the Palestinian area,

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.160 align:middle line:90%
and grounded themselves.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And became like a bulwark
against any other kind

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:00.010 align:middle line:90%
of religion.

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
lot of frustration

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:02.970 align:middle line:84%
between all the
Christians in Europe

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:06.480 align:middle line:84%
who were-- depending on who
was in charge in Jerusalem,

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.900 align:middle line:84%
there would often be given safe
passage to the holy places.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:12.761 align:middle line:84%
But when the Turks took over it
was like, no, no, no, no, no.

00:42:12.761 --> 00:42:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Unless you pay us a lot
of money, a lot of gold,

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.160 align:middle line:84%
we're basically
going to gut you.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And there was
all the gutting going on--

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:18.513 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Literally.

00:42:18.513 --> 00:42:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --literally gutting
going on, on both sides

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:24.130 align:middle line:84%
of the fence, to
the point where if--

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:26.610 align:middle line:84%
any pilgrim that was
caught in the wrong time

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:29.140 align:middle line:84%
at the wrong place
they'd be captured.

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:30.846 align:middle line:90%
They were put in a square.

00:42:30.846 --> 00:42:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And that the ones
that didn't die

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:34.110 align:middle line:84%
from exhaustion,
and from beatings,

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:36.400 align:middle line:84%
they were used for
target practice.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:37.560 align:middle line:90%
Live target practice.

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And after that
there were tortured.

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:41.520 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime,
you had the priests

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.770 align:middle line:90%
egging on all the Christians--

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:44.364 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, that part.

00:42:44.364 --> 00:42:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Just like in this religious
order, egging the peasant

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:54.090 align:middle line:84%
soldiers on by telling
them that the Arabs would

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:55.680 align:middle line:90%
swallow their riches--

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.490 align:middle line:84%
their coins and
their jewels, right?

00:42:57.490 --> 00:42:57.720 align:middle line:90%
So they'd have to cut them open.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So they'd have to
cut them in their bellies,

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.330 align:middle line:90%
and probe in the entrail--

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A good way
to motivate them.

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --to find out where
these riches were buried.

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:05.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the image
is so horrific.

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was happening
on both sides.

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.730 align:middle line:90%
Everybody had lost the plot.

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:10.650 align:middle line:84%
They were basically
looking after something

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:11.946 align:middle line:90%
that was no longer spiritual.

00:43:11.946 --> 00:43:13.320 align:middle line:84%
They were looking
after something

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.826 align:middle line:90%
that was now material.

00:43:14.826 --> 00:43:16.200 align:middle line:84%
It was all about
material wealth.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.570 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like the Aztecs,
who also lost the plot.

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And the Maya kept the plot,
because they saw the--

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh,
distinctly different.

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:22.180 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:23.860 align:middle line:84%
They saw the whole
thing as a metaphor.

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:25.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: You don't
take this literally.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:26.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a metaphor.

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:29.470 align:middle line:84%
They're tools to aid your
spiritual development.

00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:32.728 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And that's where Europe
also got it wrong as well.

00:43:32.728 --> 00:43:34.424 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, around
the same time period.

00:43:34.424 --> 00:43:35.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yes.

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now as the
incursion of the Moors or Arabs

00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:43.170 align:middle line:84%
occurred in Jerusalem--
as I understand it

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:47.130 align:middle line:84%
from your book, the only
area that was not taken over

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:49.680 align:middle line:84%
was the Christian
sector, which was

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.560 align:middle line:84%
where the Church of
the Holy Sepulcher is.

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Which, to this day, is still
in the Christian quadrant

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:55.710 align:middle line:90%
of Jerusalem.

00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:56.170 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:56.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Yeah.

00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:58.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
how did that remain

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.990 align:middle line:90%
protected amidst all of this?

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: A lot of the
people who began--

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:06.190 align:middle line:84%
again, it depends on which
decade you're talking about

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:08.010 align:middle line:90%
and who is in power.

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:10.290 align:middle line:84%
But it seems to me, from
the surviving documents,

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:13.870 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of the Arab
people who were actually

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:17.180 align:middle line:84%
in control of the whole of the
Palestinian and Jerusalem area,

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:18.730 align:middle line:84%
they was actually
very enlightened.

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:21.063 align:middle line:84%
And they recognized that the
only way this problem would

00:44:21.063 --> 00:44:23.410 align:middle line:84%
ever solve itself,
because the location is

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:25.750 align:middle line:84%
so important to so
many different people,

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:27.280 align:middle line:90%
is to give access to everyone.

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:28.480 align:middle line:90%
Everyone is equal.

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.976 align:middle line:84%
But once in a while
the story changes.

00:44:30.976 --> 00:44:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Because you got
someone else that

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:34.572 align:middle line:84%
comes in, and has lost
the plot, and they

00:44:34.572 --> 00:44:36.280 align:middle line:84%
want to basically
control the whole thing

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:37.800 align:middle line:90%
for their own political aims.

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:38.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:39.100 align:middle line:90%
And this is interesting.

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is where
the story is nuanced.

00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Because, again,
within Arabic culture

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:47.500 align:middle line:84%
was a very high understanding of
some of the spiritual teachings

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:48.580 align:middle line:90%
you're talking about.

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Mathematics, geometry,
sound, music.

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And they brought-- the higher
factions brought that with them

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:56.449 align:middle line:90%
to that region as well.

00:44:56.449 --> 00:44:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And the Templars
picked up on that

00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:59.948 align:middle line:84%
because they were
friends with the Arabs.

00:44:59.948 --> 00:45:01.390 align:middle line:90%
They all got along just fine.

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:01.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And the
gnostic Christians.

00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:05.620 align:middle line:84%
They got along just fine with
the Arabs and the Muslims.

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.869 align:middle line:84%
And that they basically
brought all this understanding

00:45:07.869 --> 00:45:08.780 align:middle line:90%
into Europe.

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:11.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's thanks to the
Templars, essentially,

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:15.260 align:middle line:84%
and the Cistercians, who
basically brought this in

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:17.774 align:middle line:84%
via, and through, the
construct of Gothic cathedrals.

00:45:17.774 --> 00:45:19.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was
just going to say.

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: It's essentially--
the Gothic art

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.400 align:middle line:84%
is essentially the mirror
image of the Arabic art.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:26.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: So they were
light years ahead--

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:26.969 align:middle line:90%
the Arabs were.

00:45:26.969 --> 00:45:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Because they had already had
contact with the Libraries

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:30.297 align:middle line:90%
of Alexandria.

00:45:30.297 --> 00:45:31.630 align:middle line:90%
They'd come from that tradition.

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:33.430 align:middle line:84%
They'd come from the
Mandaean tradition.

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:36.350 align:middle line:84%
People who were literally light
years ahead of anybody else.

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And they used the
Templars as a way

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:40.965 align:middle line:84%
to actually put
this into Europe.

00:45:40.965 --> 00:45:42.340 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
wonderful connection

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:43.540 align:middle line:90%
between all of these people.

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of documents
support the concepts.

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: At the higher levels.

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: At the very high level.

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But when you
go down to the masses who

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:51.670 align:middle line:84%
were hungry, and
educated, it doesn't

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:52.840 align:middle line:90%
matter what side you're on.

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:53.817 align:middle line:90%
It's just ugly.

00:45:53.817 --> 00:45:54.775 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It's survival.

00:45:54.775 --> 00:45:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's just survival.

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And it's also
dogma, and it's also--

00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It is.

00:45:57.590 --> 00:45:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: --propaganda.

00:45:58.330 --> 00:45:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now--

00:45:58.600 --> 00:45:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Kind of
like today, actually.

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:00.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Like today.

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:01.930 align:middle line:90%
So let's bring the church in.

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:05.540 align:middle line:84%
What was the pope's motivation,
then, for the Crusades?

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
how these rag-tag--

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.000 align:middle line:84%
this rag-tag
assemblage occurred.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Because this is where
some of the characters

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.540 align:middle line:90%
start entering in.

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:15.070 align:middle line:10%
Some of these
wonderful characters,

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:16.702 align:middle line:10%
like Peter the Hermit.

00:46:16.702 --> 00:46:17.994 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:17.994 --> 00:46:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Peter the
Hermit, it turns out,

00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:21.730 align:middle line:84%
was one of the
original monks that

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:24.260 align:middle line:84%
went, or vowed to take
care of this land that

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:25.060 align:middle line:90%
was given to them.

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:27.297 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the members
of the Order of Sion.

00:46:27.297 --> 00:46:29.630 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out that he was
actually the spiritual guide

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:32.780 align:middle line:84%
to this young guy to become the
first patriarch of Jerusalem.

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:34.720 align:middle line:84%
So talk about a
long relationship.

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:40.870 align:middle line:84%
I always believed that the whole
idea for the pope encouraging

00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:43.270 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of thousands of
people to march on Jerusalem

00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:46.100 align:middle line:84%
was just the liberation
of the Holy Sepulcher.

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:47.080 align:middle line:90%
I thought, OK.

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Because we're now in a decade
where the Turks are not

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:50.745 align:middle line:90%
allowing anybody in.

00:46:50.745 --> 00:46:52.870 align:middle line:84%
The Christians are not
being allowed in unless they

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:53.890 align:middle line:90%
pay a lot of money.

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them
didn't even survive

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.820 align:middle line:84%
getting to the Church
of Holy Sepulcher.

00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:59.170 align:middle line:90%
I can buy that.

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:00.610 align:middle line:90%
But then I read something else.

00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:03.068 align:middle line:84%
That there was a lot of trouble
going on in Constantinople,

00:47:03.068 --> 00:47:05.830 align:middle line:90%
where the Emperor Comnenus who--

00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:07.780 align:middle line:90%
real untrustworthy guy.

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:10.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this guy had a
multiple personality disorder.

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:12.710 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that
he was friends--

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:15.910 align:middle line:84%
in fact, the only friend
that he had was the pope.

00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think he persuaded the
pope to send an army his way,

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:22.120 align:middle line:84%
to Constantinople, to fight
the Turks-- to remove them

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:25.020 align:middle line:84%
from his land so they can
basically invade Turkey.

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Or what would become
Turkey later on.

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:30.160 align:middle line:84%
I think that that was part of
the motivation for the pope

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.200 align:middle line:90%
actually going to the Holy Land.

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.530 align:middle line:84%
There may have even been
two different concepts

00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:37.180 align:middle line:90%
going on here at the same time.

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:39.160 align:middle line:84%
It seems as though
the army was sent over

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:42.415 align:middle line:84%
to help Comnenus get
rid of his enemies.

00:47:42.415 --> 00:47:44.290 align:middle line:84%
But then they thought,
well, while we're here

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:46.257 align:middle line:84%
we might as well get all
the way to Jerusalem.

00:47:46.257 --> 00:47:47.090 align:middle line:90%
It took him forever.

00:47:47.090 --> 00:47:48.044 align:middle line:90%
It took him years.

00:47:48.044 --> 00:47:49.960 align:middle line:84%
They were under the
impression that they would

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:51.512 align:middle line:90%
take him a couple of weeks.

00:47:51.512 --> 00:47:53.470 align:middle line:84%
I have a letter from one
of the knights saying,

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:55.180 align:middle line:84%
yeah-- they're
writing to his wife.

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:57.640 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we're going to be in
Jerusalem in a couple of weeks.

00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Three years later
they finally arrived.

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:02.170 align:middle line:84%
So it tells me that
the plan appears

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:04.120 align:middle line:90%
to have changed on route.

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the deed is
done and they finally

00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:10.810 align:middle line:84%
do get to Jerusalem, it
seems to me that the--

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:13.210 align:middle line:84%
it took a while for
the pope to recognize

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:15.640 align:middle line:84%
that there was something else
going on in Jerusalem, where

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.160 align:middle line:84%
there's a group of guys who
are doing something very, very

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:19.260 align:middle line:90%
mysterious.

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And when you do something
behind closed doors

00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:23.620 align:middle line:84%
you want to know
what's going on.

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:27.010 align:middle line:84%
So the pope was always five
steps behind this small group

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:28.465 align:middle line:90%
of people--

00:48:28.465 --> 00:48:30.724 align:middle line:84%
about nine or 11
people-- or 11 Templars.

00:48:30.724 --> 00:48:32.890 align:middle line:84%
I've come to the conclusion
that there were actually

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:35.430 align:middle line:84%
11 original people,
for good reason.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's documentation
to back it up.

00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:41.230 align:middle line:84%
But he was always
behind the times of what

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:42.550 align:middle line:90%
the Templars were really up to.

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Because by the time the
Templars are officially

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:48.472 align:middle line:84%
ordained by the pope
in 1128, well, the news

00:48:48.472 --> 00:48:49.930 align:middle line:84%
has really been
out for a long time

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:52.710 align:middle line:84%
that the Templars have been
around for at least 20 years.

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is going, well, that
was a really boring story.

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:56.280 align:middle line:84%
We know about the
Order of the Temple.

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:57.640 align:middle line:90%
They've been around for years.

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.275 align:middle line:84%
So the pope was trying
to get in on the act.

00:49:00.275 --> 00:49:02.650 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to muscle in on
what they were looking for.

00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:05.750 align:middle line:84%
Because the idea was that
they found this big treasure

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:07.180 align:middle line:90%
underneath Temple Mount.

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Of course, to most
people treasure

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:12.440 align:middle line:84%
brings up money, riches, gold,
which brings up the point

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:13.240 align:middle line:90%
again--

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.415 align:middle line:84%
why would a bunch of
nobles travel all the way

00:49:15.415 --> 00:49:18.750 align:middle line:84%
to the Holy Land to dig tunnels
in inhospitable conditions

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:20.022 align:middle line:90%
to look for money?

00:49:20.022 --> 00:49:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When they
came from money

00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:23.100 align:middle line:84%
and they had already
disavowed it.

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Stay at
home, keep the money,

00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:28.740 align:middle line:84%
put your feet up, and sit by
the fire and read a good book.

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:30.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not difficult
to understand.

00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So aside
from these royals,

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:34.800 align:middle line:84%
which have given it all up,
which are there searching

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.740 align:middle line:84%
for something mysterious
under the Temple Mount--

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:41.280 align:middle line:84%
which of course, the debate
still rages to this day

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.930 align:middle line:90%
in certain ways--

00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:45.380 align:middle line:84%
you have other
characters that enter in.

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Extreme ascetics such
as Peter the Hermit.

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Now how does he start
factoring into this story?

00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh.

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:53.760 align:middle line:84%
They're all into
extreme asceticism.

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:55.636 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
out-asceticize each other--

00:49:55.636 --> 00:49:56.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, my God.

00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:58.204 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --if that's
even an adjective.

00:49:58.204 --> 00:50:00.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're literally
trying to outdo themselves

00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:00.860 align:middle line:84%
at being more poor
than anybody else.

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:02.193 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm sleeping on straw.

00:50:02.193 --> 00:50:03.380 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm sleeping on dirt.

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:05.380 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm sleeping in a bog.

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: I'm going to
sleep in the woods.

00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:09.485 align:middle line:90%
They were quite funny.

00:50:09.485 --> 00:50:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's Walter
the Penniless as well.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: All these
people suddenly

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.460 align:middle line:84%
renounced their
worldly possessions

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:15.793 align:middle line:90%
to go on this spiritual journey.

00:50:15.793 --> 00:50:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And Peter the
Hermit, it turns out,

00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:18.790 align:middle line:84%
was actually very
central to the story.

00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:21.456 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Because he was one
of the original founders

00:50:21.456 --> 00:50:25.110 align:middle line:84%
of this Order of Sion,
that is so mysterious.

00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, when
the Crusades end up

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:32.370 align:middle line:84%
in Jerusalem, and the Templars,
and the Order of the Knights

00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:34.720 align:middle line:84%
of the Holy Sepulcher,
he basically

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:38.130 align:middle line:84%
is given charge of
most of Jerusalem

00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:41.790 align:middle line:84%
when they basically go off and
do whatever they were doing

00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:44.340 align:middle line:90%
quietly outside of Jerusalem.

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:46.560 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the Crusades,
it was mopping up the land,

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:48.664 align:middle line:84%
and getting rid of
their Arab enemies.

00:50:48.664 --> 00:50:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And on the other side,
there was another group

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:53.029 align:middle line:84%
of people doing something
else very secretly.

00:50:53.029 --> 00:50:55.320 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out he was actually
a very important person

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:56.910 align:middle line:90%
in the big scheme of things.

00:50:56.910 --> 00:51:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And he eventually
decides to take back

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:04.920 align:middle line:84%
what he learns, in terms of
spiritual angle in Jerusalem,

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and goes back to
Europe and founds

00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:09.630 align:middle line:84%
his own particular school,
based on the principles

00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:11.040 align:middle line:90%
of John the Baptist.

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:14.020 align:middle line:84%
So here's a guy
who has written--

00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:16.660 align:middle line:84%
he's like a little minuscule
sideline in history.

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And yet, he is so important
in the big scheme of things.

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:21.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who had a lot
of influence and power.

00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:23.100 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like he
was revered, and had

00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:24.360 align:middle line:90%
great levels of respect--

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, very much so.

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Among the
high and low circles.

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:27.889 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: He was the top.

00:51:27.889 --> 00:51:29.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Plucking
hairs off his donkey--

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:30.620 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:32.355 align:middle line:84%
--just to have a
little piece of him.

00:51:32.355 --> 00:51:33.729 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: He was
so holy that they

00:51:33.729 --> 00:51:35.315 align:middle line:90%
plucked the hairs off his mule.

00:51:35.315 --> 00:51:37.647 align:middle line:84%
I get the vision
of watching that.

00:51:37.647 --> 00:51:39.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like, do
you want my autograph?

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:40.280 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.730 align:middle line:90%
We want a hair off your mule.

00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:42.540 align:middle line:90%
It's hysterical.

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:42.870 align:middle line:90%
But no.

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:43.670 align:middle line:90%
He was.

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:46.180 align:middle line:84%
He was revered because he was
actually walking the talk.

00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:47.891 align:middle line:90%
He was doing real Christianity.

00:51:47.891 --> 00:51:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Not what the Catholic
Church had turned it into.

00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he
was appreciated.

00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:52.914 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
an undercurrent

00:51:52.914 --> 00:51:54.330 align:middle line:84%
in Europe of people
who understood

00:51:54.330 --> 00:51:56.825 align:middle line:84%
the real message
of Christianity,

00:51:56.825 --> 00:51:58.200 align:middle line:84%
which is not the
message that was

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.020 align:middle line:90%
being promoted by the church.

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:01.450 align:middle line:90%
Not in any way imaginable.

00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:04.460 align:middle line:84%
This is why I never confuse
Christianity with Catholicism.

00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:07.030 align:middle line:84%
The two are very
different to each other.

00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:08.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, early
Christianity is almost

00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:10.690 align:middle line:90%
like a version of Buddhism.

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:11.840 align:middle line:90%
Zen.

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:13.065 align:middle line:90%
Not dissimilar.

00:52:13.065 --> 00:52:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Not dissimilar from
esoteric Islam, either.

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.450 align:middle line:84%
They're all pretty
much the same thing.

00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So he was actually
practicing this.

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:23.380 align:middle line:84%
He put his life on the line, put
his money aside, and actually

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:24.180 align:middle line:90%
went there.

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And he nearly died on
the way to Palestine.

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, the guy that
picks him up off the ground,

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:33.120 align:middle line:84%
literally, finds his emaciated
body on the road to Jerusalem,

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:34.120 align:middle line:90%
is Godfrey de Bouillon--

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:36.245 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's who I was
going to ask about next.

00:52:36.245 --> 00:52:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --the young man who
was taught by Peter the Hermit.

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.565 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like-- the whole
thing sounds like a premeditated

00:52:40.565 --> 00:52:40.990 align:middle line:90%
plan--

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.177 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ohh.

00:52:41.177 --> 00:52:41.290 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:41.440 align:middle line:90%
Can I read--

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --because
I think it was.

00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm just going to read
some of his traits just to--

00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:47.260 align:middle line:90%
This could take an hour.

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:48.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, this
is his resume, right?

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:51.877 align:middle line:84%
Godfrey-- "God-fray"
de Bouillon, right?

00:52:51.877 --> 00:52:53.085 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Godfrey de Bouillon.

00:52:53.085 --> 00:52:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:59.640 align:middle line:84%
"Tall, blond, bearded, pious,
humble, gentle, generous.

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:00.960 align:middle line:90%
A model knight.

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Virtuous."

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Really, it almost sounds like
the Knights at the Round Table.

00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Combination of Lancelot
and Arthur, right?

00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:11.220 align:middle line:84%
"He was named King of Jerusalem,
but actually refused."

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:12.642 align:middle line:90%
So let's go on from there.

00:53:12.642 --> 00:53:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about who this
character was, because he's

00:53:14.850 --> 00:53:16.382 align:middle line:90%
so central to the story.

00:53:16.382 --> 00:53:17.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: It turns out--

00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:19.810 align:middle line:84%
I think that-- and there
are echoes of this.

00:53:19.810 --> 00:53:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And again, when you're
dealing with something

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:22.530 align:middle line:84%
as precious as the
holy bloodline that

00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:25.140 align:middle line:84%
has been persecuted for
1,000 years in Europe,

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:26.977 align:middle line:84%
you don't draw
attention to yourself.

00:53:26.977 --> 00:53:29.310 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's something
that I brought up in the book,

00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:32.790 align:middle line:84%
and that Henry Lincoln and
company had also brought up

00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:34.290 align:middle line:84%
in the "Holy Blood,
Holy Grail"--

00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:36.560 align:middle line:84%
was that there are echoes
of the fact that Godfrey de

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:37.976 align:middle line:84%
Bouillon appears
to have been part

00:53:37.976 --> 00:53:39.990 align:middle line:90%
out of this holy bloodline.

00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Why else were these monks sort
of moved halfway across Europe

00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:45.120 align:middle line:84%
to groom a young
man, who had become

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:47.277 align:middle line:90%
the custodian of Jerusalem?

00:53:47.277 --> 00:53:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Because when you actually look
at the paperwork that survives,

00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:53.640 align:middle line:84%
it turns out that when the
initiation ceremony was done

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:58.230 align:middle line:84%
to put Godfrey on the
throne, and his brothers--

00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:00.150 align:middle line:84%
because he died
there shortly after--

00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.290 align:middle line:90%
they were all--

00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was
poisoned, right?

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:01.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: --done.

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:03.225 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was
poisoned, right?

00:54:03.225 --> 00:54:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Um--

00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Was he poisoned?

00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: No.

00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:05.349 align:middle line:90%
He died a normal death.

00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:06.390 align:middle line:90%
The others were poisoned.

00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, the
others were poisoned.

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:08.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: Although it
gets very confusing.

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:08.745 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm confused.

00:54:08.745 --> 00:54:09.030 align:middle line:90%
But go ahead.

00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:09.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: I know.

00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:10.143 align:middle line:90%
It's very confusing.

00:54:10.143 --> 00:54:11.010 align:middle line:90%
They all died.

00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:12.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, they died.

00:54:12.010 --> 00:54:13.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Everybody dies.

00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:15.780 align:middle line:84%
But the ceremonies were
always conducted on land

00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:17.560 align:middle line:90%
owned by the Order of Sion.

00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:18.630 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:21.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And it was always said
that Godfrey owed his throne

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.506 align:middle line:90%
to the Order of Sion.

00:54:22.506 --> 00:54:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's something you
hear again, and again,

00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:26.320 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
Templars story as well.

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.680 align:middle line:84%
Not just in Jerusalem,
but also in Portugal.

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:32.340 align:middle line:84%
They owed their position
to the Order of Sion.

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:34.190 align:middle line:90%
So they owed him a favor.

00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Not as though their--

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.680 align:middle line:84%
they have to have
sort of paid him dues.

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:40.710 align:middle line:84%
But they are obligated to
repay a certain favor in order

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:43.380 align:middle line:84%
to keep a certain
connection, and transaction

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:44.994 align:middle line:90%
going between the two groups.

00:54:44.994 --> 00:54:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And I found that
very interesting.

00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:48.150 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out
that here we have

00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:51.130 align:middle line:84%
the inklings of a bloodline
that was kept very quiet,

00:54:51.130 --> 00:54:51.930 align:middle line:90%
very on the ground.

00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, window of
opportunity comes up.

00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:54.810 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:56.351 align:middle line:84%
Let's put him in
Jerusalem, and we'll

00:54:56.351 --> 00:54:58.020 align:middle line:90%
get the ball rolling from there.

00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how did the pope
and the church relate to him?

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Not well.

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:03.600 align:middle line:90%
They kind of--

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were sort
of trying to figure out

00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:07.080 align:middle line:90%
where this is all going.

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Because they tried to put
such a big stamp on top

00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:15.150 align:middle line:84%
of the holy bloodline, and try
to miniaturize it to the point

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:17.450 align:middle line:90%
where they would--

00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:19.710 align:middle line:84%
these people were described
as great faith-healers.

00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:21.700 align:middle line:90%
And also great mystics.

00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:25.170 align:middle line:84%
At this point you have a group
of monks sitting in an office.

00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:27.030 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was
somewhere in Ireland.

00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And they were actually
told to create the story

00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:32.970 align:middle line:84%
to deminiaturize this
holy bloodline by turning

00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:34.860 align:middle line:84%
into fairies, and to
supernatural beings.

00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:36.194 align:middle line:90%
That they weren't actually real.

00:55:36.194 --> 00:55:37.859 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
concept of the fairies

00:55:37.859 --> 00:55:39.568 align:middle line:84%
actually comes from--
in the Middle Ages.

00:55:39.568 --> 00:55:41.483 align:middle line:84%
Because fairies are
supposed to be bad people.

00:55:41.483 --> 00:55:43.410 align:middle line:84%
If you're affected by
fairies in your dreams,

00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:45.190 align:middle line:90%
that's the devil talking to you.

00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And there are these
supposed people

00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:48.840 align:middle line:84%
that come from a
divine source, that

00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:51.270 align:middle line:84%
pretend to be humans,
that are bad people

00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:53.820 align:middle line:84%
because they associate with
fairies and little people.

00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's those-- the
church's PR department,

00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.700 align:middle line:84%
what becomes the
Holy Inquisition--

00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:01.950 align:middle line:84%
are trying to educate
the public that anything

00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:04.370 align:middle line:84%
to do with the holy bloodline--
if you hear about this,

00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:06.540 align:middle line:84%
or see anything, you
come and talk to us.

00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:07.780 align:middle line:90%
And we'll take care of it.

00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:09.750 align:middle line:84%
That's how they worked,
to try and make sure

00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:13.559 align:middle line:84%
that the lid was kept firmly on
this people who had the right--

00:56:13.559 --> 00:56:14.642 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With the masses.

00:56:14.642 --> 00:56:16.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: --to rule by
divine appointment.

00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Not the church.

00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:19.209 align:middle line:84%
They had inserted themselves
into this position.

00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:22.339 align:middle line:84%
And now find themselves in the
terrible position of keeping

00:56:22.339 --> 00:56:23.630 align:middle line:90%
track, and a lid on everything.

00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:25.838 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the whole
thing was blowing wide open,

00:56:25.838 --> 00:56:27.450 align:middle line:84%
because of the
influential people

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:29.040 align:middle line:90%
that had moved into Jerusalem.

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:31.507 align:middle line:84%
And positioned themselves
outside of the church.

00:56:31.507 --> 00:56:32.340 align:middle line:90%
They had no control.

00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:34.315 align:middle line:84%
The church had no control
over these people.

00:56:34.315 --> 00:56:35.940 align:middle line:84%
That's why there were
always five steps

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:37.440 align:middle line:90%
behind what they were doing.

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And also, Godfrey's--

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:44.280 align:middle line:84%
his mission was dedicated
to Our Lady, right?

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:45.805 align:middle line:90%
He was very ordered toward--

00:56:45.805 --> 00:56:46.058 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh, absolutely.

00:56:46.058 --> 00:56:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --our lady.

00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Absolutely.

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:49.410 align:middle line:90%
So we just accept that.

00:56:49.410 --> 00:56:50.810 align:middle line:90%
Now let's go to Hugues.

00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about how he
interfaces in this story.

00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Because the way the characters
all come together is very--

00:56:58.050 --> 00:56:59.245 align:middle line:90%
it's a tangled web.

00:56:59.245 --> 00:57:00.120 align:middle line:90%
It's confusing to me.

00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:01.125 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Appropriate.

00:57:01.125 --> 00:57:01.925 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:01.925 --> 00:57:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SILVA: And also
somewhat designed.

00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Hugues de Payens
was, again, a noble.

00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:09.900 align:middle line:84%
He had extensive
connections to people

00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:12.069 align:middle line:84%
in Burgundy, who turns
out were all connected

00:57:12.069 --> 00:57:13.110 align:middle line:90%
to this divine bloodline.

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:16.200 align:middle line:84%
They were all part of the
offshoots of these families.

00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And not much is
written about him.

00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Maybe because it
was never written.

00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Or because the
information is now lost,

00:57:21.590 --> 00:57:23.910 align:middle line:84%
as it tends to be of
the times of warfare.

00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:25.410 align:middle line:84%
But what we do know
is that he spent

00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:29.152 align:middle line:84%
a lot of his formative
years being groomed by one

00:57:29.152 --> 00:57:30.360 align:middle line:90%
of the members of his family.

00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:31.980 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was
his grandfather, who

00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:33.000 align:middle line:90%
was a great mystic.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And also had a great
appreciation for Arabic

00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:35.820 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And he said, actually, my
grandson, the Christian belief

00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:41.250 align:middle line:90%
and the Muslim belief--

00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:42.214 align:middle line:90%
it is the same thing.

00:57:42.214 --> 00:57:44.130 align:middle line:84%
So why don't you go walk
about the Middle East

00:57:44.130 --> 00:57:45.250 align:middle line:90%
and discover yourself.

00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's apparently
what he did.

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:50.240 align:middle line:84%
So in 1100 and 1104, we
find Hugues de Payens

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:53.160 align:middle line:84%
suddenly appearing
mysteriously in Jerusalem,

00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:56.460 align:middle line:84%
talking to other members of
the-- now the Proto-Templars.

00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And hanging out with the
people that come from Burgundy.

00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:00.720 align:middle line:90%
And Godfrey de Bouillon.

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And also a bunch of people
that cruised all the way over

00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:07.470 align:middle line:84%
from this county, on the
opposite side of Europe

00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:09.040 align:middle line:90%
called Portugale.

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:11.680 align:middle line:84%
They suddenly appear in
Jerusalem at the same time.

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:13.710 align:middle line:10%
A big opportune
moment of meeting

00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:17.370 align:middle line:10%
of people, all of whose
roots go back to Burgundy.

00:58:17.370 --> 00:58:19.200 align:middle line:84%
So they all stretch
out throughout Europe

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:22.050 align:middle line:84%
all the way to the
far west, and in 1104

00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:25.170 align:middle line:84%
they suddenly appear,
magically, in the same place.

00:58:25.170 --> 00:58:26.460 align:middle line:90%
All talking to each other.

00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:28.770 align:middle line:84%
All have the same
idea of creating

00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:31.474 align:middle line:84%
a kingdom of conscience,
as far from Rome

00:58:31.474 --> 00:58:32.640 align:middle line:90%
as you could possibly do it.

00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:35.610 align:middle line:10%
So you can just imagine
sitting down in Jerusalem--

00:58:35.610 --> 00:58:37.870 align:middle line:10%
there's still the
smoldering, ashes of battle--

00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:39.480 align:middle line:10%
sitting in a cafe
and going, you know,

00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:42.480 align:middle line:10%
it would be such a great idea
if we found the plot of land

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:45.480 align:middle line:10%
somewhere as far away
from Rome as possible,

00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:48.000 align:middle line:10%
and create a real true
kingdom of conscience.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:48.900 align:middle line:90%
Real Christianity.

00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Real spirituality,
where we could

00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:54.670 align:middle line:84%
really embody the ideals and
aspirations of all people.

00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So that we can
all rise together.

00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:57.990 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't this be a great idea?

00:58:57.990 --> 00:59:00.031 align:middle line:84%
And you can just imagine
having this conversation

00:59:00.031 --> 00:59:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and going, actually,
I know someone

00:59:02.730 --> 00:59:04.054 align:middle line:90%
who just came in on a boat.

00:59:04.054 --> 00:59:05.220 align:middle line:90%
They've got a piece of land.

00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:06.630 align:middle line:90%
And they come from my hometown.

00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.920 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:59:07.290 --> 00:59:08.430 align:middle line:90%
In fact, they're your cousins.

00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:09.230 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:10.290 align:middle line:90%
And he's my uncle.

00:59:10.290 --> 00:59:11.998 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, all
those people are either

00:59:11.998 --> 00:59:14.176 align:middle line:84%
uncles, cousins,
or some relation

00:59:14.176 --> 00:59:15.300 align:middle line:90%
to all of these bloodlines.

00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
people in Burgundy

00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:21.240 align:middle line:84%
who are very influential
in creating organizations

00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:22.620 align:middle line:90%
from scratch.

00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And in 1104 they're
all in the same place,

00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:27.180 align:middle line:90%
hatching a big plot.

00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then another man,
a very important character,

00:59:30.030 --> 00:59:31.430 align:middle line:90%
Bernard de Clairvaux comes in.

00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh.

00:59:32.310 --> 00:59:33.601 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so you know what?

00:59:33.601 --> 00:59:34.540 align:middle line:90%
We're out of time.

00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:36.704 align:middle line:84%
We're going to pick it
up with the development

00:59:36.704 --> 00:59:38.370 align:middle line:84%
of this cast of
characters just a little

00:59:38.370 --> 00:59:40.820 align:middle line:84%
bit more so that people get
the nature of the group that

00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:41.620 align:middle line:90%
had assembled--

00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: He's the man.

00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:43.438 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He's the man.

00:59:43.438 --> 00:59:46.250 align:middle line:84%
So we'll save the man for
the next conversation.

00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:47.700 align:middle line:90%
So OK?

00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:48.927 align:middle line:90%
We'll remember where we are?

00:59:48.927 --> 00:59:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Because we're only like
a quarter of the way

00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:52.176 align:middle line:84%
through all of
this at this point.

00:59:52.176 --> 00:59:53.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SILVA: Oh my god.

00:59:53.490 --> 00:59:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In part 2 of our
story we go back to Jerusalem,

00:59:56.130 --> 00:59:58.650 align:middle line:84%
and dig under the Temple
Mount with the Templar.

00:59:58.650 --> 01:00:01.140 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason that
kings and popes alike

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:04.620 align:middle line:84%
gave the Templars vast tracts
of land, gold, and silver.

01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:05.864 align:middle line:90%
What did they possess?

01:00:05.864 --> 01:00:07.530 align:middle line:84%
