00:00:19.574 --> 00:00:20.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Raise your hand

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.980 align:middle line:84%
if you have a firm
understanding of the economy.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.710 align:middle line:90%
I didn't raise mine either.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.270 align:middle line:10%
From my vantage point, it
seems like one big charade,

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.600 align:middle line:10%
a source of infotainment
for the evening news

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.830 align:middle line:10%
and cable channels.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.370 align:middle line:10%
Yet for many, if not most
of us, our money situation

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.480 align:middle line:10%
causes far more
pain than pleasure.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.820 align:middle line:10%
This means we are now
on a need to know basis

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.310 align:middle line:10%
as to what's going on.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Toward that end, I've
invited Ranting Andy Hoffman

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.360 align:middle line:84%
to help us work our way through
the maze of how the world's

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.630 align:middle line:84%
economies were brought
to the brink of collapse.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And what we can do about
it, if anything, now.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank
you for joining us.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.940 align:middle line:90%
This is critical information.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.690 align:middle line:84%
You spent 15 to 20 years
as a Wall Street analyst.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And some of the people that
are in the headlines today

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.700 align:middle line:90%
were your former bosses.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.580 align:middle line:90%
So you know what the game is.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.732 align:middle line:84%
And I love what you
do on your blog.

00:01:06.732 --> 00:01:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't
pull any punches.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.320 align:middle line:84%
But you do such a
beautiful job of tying

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.200 align:middle line:84%
what seem disparate
bits of economic news

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.375 align:middle line:84%
together to see where this
whole thing is flowing badly.

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>>ANDY HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.069 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I learned--
the one thing

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:21.610 align:middle line:84%
I got from Wall
Street that's helpful

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.080 align:middle line:90%
these days is communication.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.690 align:middle line:84%
But after that, it's
completely different.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.460 align:middle line:10%
I've almost become-- I don't
want to say a whistle blower,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.970 align:middle line:10%
but a crusader
against what I saw.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.820 align:middle line:10%
I left the industry in 2005.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.670 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I was with
Salomon Smith Barney,

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.670 align:middle line:10%
which is a Citigroup
company, for seven years.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And I learned more about
the bad side of Wall Street

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.260 align:middle line:90%
than I could imagine.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing
is, what happened

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.050 align:middle line:84%
back then was nothing
compared to what we see today.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I know.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.840 align:middle line:90%
Sad.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.879 align:middle line:90%
Sadly but true.

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:54.170 align:middle line:10%
You know what I thought I'd do.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.920 align:middle line:10%
I have this little
list of questions here.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.980 align:middle line:10%
Because we literally could
talk for 8 or 10 hours

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.740 align:middle line:10%
and barely unravel
what's going on.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.340 align:middle line:10%
But I thought what we'd do
is maybe start back 1929,

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:10%
runs on the bank, what
the world was like.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.510 align:middle line:84%
What the context of this was
like in a country that was

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.560 align:middle line:84%
not-- it wasn't-- our economies
weren't so global at the time.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.427 align:middle line:84%
What was it then and then
lead forward from there.

00:02:21.427 --> 00:02:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, back
then the United States

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:84%
was an emerging
power in the world.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.390 align:middle line:84%
We were also on a
gold standard, as was

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.950 align:middle line:90%
much of the rest of the world.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.760 align:middle line:84%
So what you saw was
what you got when

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.650 align:middle line:90%
it came to economic activity.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.400 align:middle line:10%
The Federal Reserve
had just been

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.490 align:middle line:10%
created about 15 years before.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.930 align:middle line:10%
So there really was no real
debt load yet to speak of.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't take
long from 1913

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.680 align:middle line:84%
until the roaring '20s for
the banks to do what they do,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.570 align:middle line:84%
which is to promote
debt and speculation.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
roaring '20s was.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.920 align:middle line:90%
It was not a change in mindset.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.700 align:middle line:84%
It was an increase in wealth
created by the same banker

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.330 align:middle line:84%
games they're playing today,
only on a much lesser level.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.420 align:middle line:84%
By the time we got to the late
'20s, remember markets were not

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.960 align:middle line:90%
manipulated back then.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.160 align:middle line:84%
So there were no
government means

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.180 align:middle line:90%
of trying to alter perception.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we
had a market crash,

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.885 align:middle line:84%
which is what
happens in markets.

00:03:14.885 --> 00:03:17.880 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do with
whether it's boom or bust.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.990 align:middle line:90%
They happen.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.030 align:middle line:84%
In that particular time, it was
the United States' first period

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.060 align:middle line:84%
of rampant banker
funded speculation.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.880 align:middle line:84%
So it really took
the world by storm.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.049 align:middle line:84%
And when it happened,
the government

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.090 align:middle line:90%
didn't know how to react.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.390 align:middle line:90%
Banks were closing.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.140 align:middle line:90%
And there was no backup system.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.590 align:middle line:90%
There was really no plan at all.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.660 align:middle line:84%
So it took 20 years or
so to get out of that.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's a misnomer that
the war helped end it.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.380 align:middle line:90%
It really didn't.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.810 align:middle line:84%
If anything, the war helped
the United States simply

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.370 align:middle line:84%
because all of our competitors
overseas destroyed themselves.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.870 align:middle line:90%
That's how we came to power.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And you know, but
after the crash,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.690 align:middle line:84%
they created things like
the Glass Steagall Act.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.565 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just
going to ask that, yeah.

00:03:59.565 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: To stop
banks from speculating

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.980 align:middle line:90%
with people's money.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.270 align:middle line:90%
And you know, that--

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain the
Glass Steagall Act to us

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.490 align:middle line:84%
in kindergarten
terms, so we really

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.490 align:middle line:84%
understand what they
were trying to do

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.680 align:middle line:84%
and what happened
when, essentially, we

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.667 align:middle line:84%
moved away from that
about 20 years ago.

00:04:16.667 --> 00:04:17.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: OK.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, in today's world, you
only hear the word banks.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.400 align:middle line:84%
They may be referred to as mega
banks, too big to fail banks,

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.290 align:middle line:84%
but you only hear
the word banks.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.830 align:middle line:84%
But even 10 years ago,
let alone back then,

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:84%
there were what you call
commercial banks and investment

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:31.230 align:middle line:90%
banks.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Now a commercial bank is
what you think a bank as.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.670 align:middle line:84%
You put in your money, that
you borrow money from them.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:38.870 align:middle line:90%
They take your deposits.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And they supposedly invest
them into safe securities,

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.320 align:middle line:84%
almost like an insurance
company would do.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And they're supposedly
safe, you know.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.640 align:middle line:84%
They're there
almost as non-profit

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.527 align:middle line:90%
for the neighborhood.

00:04:51.527 --> 00:04:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if you
need-- so the point was,

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.960 align:middle line:84%
there had been a
run on the banks.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.410 align:middle line:84%
We had this disaster
economically.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is to ensure
that you, as a depositor,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.150 align:middle line:84%
can go and get your
money out of the bank

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:90%
safely at any given time.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Right.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's supposed
to be a guarantee, right.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.881 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: But the difference
between a commercial bank

00:05:07.881 --> 00:05:11.250 align:middle line:84%
and an investment bank, and
again Solomon Smith Barney

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.720 align:middle line:84%
was an investment bank, today
it would just be called a bank,

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.480 align:middle line:90%
but that's the misnomer.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.710 align:middle line:90%
They call it investment bank.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's not really
a bank at all.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a speculation machine.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.450 align:middle line:84%
Their primary business
is IPOs like Facebook.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.090 align:middle line:84%
That's what they
do for a living.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.470 align:middle line:84%
They also have what they call
proprietary trading, which

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.880 align:middle line:84%
simply means they gamble
with their own money.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.120 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
deposits, just people

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.520 align:middle line:90%
who have brokerage accounts.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's a completely
different animal.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.980 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do with
what a traditional bank is.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And until the roaring
'20s, the banks

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.020 align:middle line:84%
just did the former,
what I was talking about.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.340 align:middle line:90%
They just lent money.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.703 align:middle line:10%
But then the banks after
the Federal Reserve

00:05:51.703 --> 00:05:54.420 align:middle line:10%
came around and started to get
control of the money supply,

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.700 align:middle line:10%
and the government, they
started to speculate.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.160 align:middle line:10%
And that's what
caused the crash then.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.540 align:middle line:84%
So after the crash,
Glass Steagall

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.300 align:middle line:84%
was created to separate
those two things.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
be a speculator,

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.970 align:middle line:90%
you are an investment bank.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.970 align:middle line:84%
You can't be part
of the FDIC system.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.590 align:middle line:84%
You have to be your
own financial company.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.420 align:middle line:84%
That has nothing to do
with government backing.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we saw proliferate

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:31.110 align:middle line:84%
from the '20s through 1999, when
Glass Steagall was repealed.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.090 align:middle line:84%
So you saw these huge growth
in these non-bank banks.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
got powerful enough,

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.930 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
lobby the government

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.250 align:middle line:84%
during the good times
of 1999 when internet--

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
the roaring '90s.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah, saying well
look at great everything is.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.410 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to
have this separation.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.330 align:middle line:90%
Plus we're going to buy you.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Because you know who had the
most campaign contributions

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.700 align:middle line:84%
for Bush in 2000 and
2004, Obama in 2008,

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.462 align:middle line:84%
and Mit Romney in 2012,
is from Wall Street.

00:07:03.462 --> 00:07:04.420 align:middle line:90%
They kind of took over.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And you see the people
who took over positions

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.532 align:middle line:84%
of off-- Robert Rubin, Secretary
of the Treasury, Tim Geithner.

00:07:11.532 --> 00:07:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Tim Geithner, yeah.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: All these guys,
they come from Wall Street.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Obama's just had
the Chief of Staff

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.100 align:middle line:84%
was William Daley, who was a
managing director at JP Morgan,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and before that
Rahm Emanuel, who

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.210 align:middle line:84%
worked for Goldman Sachs
and all these guys.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.500 align:middle line:84%
So the point is, they kind
of took over the system

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.412 align:middle line:84%
and convinced, through campaign
contributions, people like Bill

00:07:31.412 --> 00:07:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Clinton and the senators
who were around in the '90s,

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.960 align:middle line:90%
that we don't need this.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.094 align:middle line:84%
And when they got
rid of it in 1999,

00:07:37.094 --> 00:07:38.510 align:middle line:84%
that was the
beginning of the end.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.180 align:middle line:84%
On top of that, that
was also the end

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.800 align:middle line:84%
of a kind of upswing
in the economy.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.125 align:middle line:84%
So you had the banks getting
more lethal at a time

00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:47.625 align:middle line:84%
where the economy
was getting worse.

00:07:47.625 --> 00:07:51.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So In 1999,
the Glass Steagall

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.130 align:middle line:90%
was repealed in essence.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And so now does that mean
that the FDIC was covering

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.830 align:middle line:84%
both the wild investment,
the investment

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.300 align:middle line:90%
banks, and the commercial banks?

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.420 align:middle line:90%
They're liable for both?

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:04.920 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.295 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: They
created something

00:08:06.295 --> 00:08:09.600 align:middle line:84%
called SIPC, Securities
Income Protection, which

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.740 align:middle line:84%
is like FDIC for
brokerages accounts.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.580 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is
the kind of things

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.270 align:middle line:90%
that bankers get accomplished.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But this isn't right.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:20.530 align:middle line:84%
The government should not be
paying for gambling debts.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:21.960 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: That's exactly right.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.050 align:middle line:84%
But when the bankers own the
government, and they truly do,

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.553 align:middle line:90%
they get whatever they want.

00:08:27.553 --> 00:08:28.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.927 align:middle line:84%
So that leads us
up to 2007, 2008.

00:08:31.927 --> 00:08:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Now there were some big
bumps along the way.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.520 align:middle line:84%
It's not like we haven't
seen difficult times before.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Early 1980s, god I remember
when interest rates on homes

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.700 align:middle line:90%
were at 14 and 15%, even higher.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And then we had the savings
and loan debacle as well.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.930 align:middle line:84%
What was happening during
that little period, as opposed

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.180 align:middle line:90%
to what's happening now?

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, that period
was just after the gold standard

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.280 align:middle line:90%
had come off, which was 1971.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So again, the nation
didn't have a lot of debt.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's no coincidence
that the nation

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.530 align:middle line:84%
didn't have a lot
of debt until 1971.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're at the public
debt that's announced

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.310 align:middle line:90%
today is $16 trillion dollars.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.460 align:middle line:84%
It was about $200 or
$300 billion back then.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.152 align:middle line:84%
And that was from
200 years of history.

00:09:14.152 --> 00:09:15.860 align:middle line:84%
That's because the
gold standard does not

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.640 align:middle line:84%
allow you to build up debt
without having a commensurate

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.930 align:middle line:90%
increase in gold.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:24.760 align:middle line:84%
So when-- in the
1970s, the government

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.450 align:middle line:84%
could print all the money it
wanted to get out of things.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And it could raise
interest rates.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Because unlike now, where
we have all this debt

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.740 align:middle line:84%
across the entire
system, it could

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.100 align:middle line:90%
take higher interest rates here.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.626 align:middle line:90%
They're at zero right now.

00:09:39.626 --> 00:09:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Some countries have just gone
to negative interest rates.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.250 align:middle line:84%
They literally can't
afford even a tiny increase

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.470 align:middle line:90%
in interest rates.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Of course, low interest
rates is bad for savers.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.840 align:middle line:90%
No one wants money in the bank.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And again, a backup on your
question, in the '70s it

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.780 align:middle line:84%
was really a cyclical
downturn, which

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:01.350 align:middle line:84%
was exacerbated by political
tensions in the Middle East

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.590 align:middle line:90%
that caused oil prices to go up.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So it was really more
of a regular downturn

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.139 align:middle line:90%
that got exacerbated.

00:10:09.139 --> 00:10:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you had the
savings and loan scandals

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.214 align:middle line:84%
that took place in the
'80s, right, on top of that.

00:10:15.214 --> 00:10:15.880 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.200 align:middle line:84%
And the savings
and loan scandals

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.670 align:middle line:84%
were more of a function
of just shoddy bank

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.210 align:middle line:84%
practices than
something more sinister.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were some
bad people involved.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.960 align:middle line:84%
But again, they had the
savings and bank loan.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.293 align:middle line:84%
They created the-- I forgot
what the name of that agency

00:10:29.293 --> 00:10:31.110 align:middle line:90%
was-- to clean it up.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.870 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Because again, it was
clean up-able back then.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was clean up-able
and fairly isolated in a sense.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And it took a few years, not
too long, to recover from that,

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.560 align:middle line:90%
as I recall.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Right, it
really was not a big deal

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.990 align:middle line:84%
for the majority of the
public, and certainly

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.090 align:middle line:84%
was not felt anywhere
around the world.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so then we're
back to the free market.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:51.960 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the free market.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.330 align:middle line:84%
It sounds from everything
I'm hearing, and certainly

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.490 align:middle line:84%
the subtext, and the direct
text of what you say,

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:02.419 align:middle line:84%
we don't really
have free markets.

00:11:02.419 --> 00:11:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, we don't--
in the United States,

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.300 align:middle line:90%
we have zero free markets.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:90%
And I mean utter zero.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:10.300 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there are
actually names.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And part of what I do is I'm
pointing out the obvious.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.630 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think
well, you're so smart.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.100 align:middle line:84%
You're so tuned
into these things.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.760 align:middle line:84%
I go, you know, I'm
just telling you

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.570 align:middle line:90%
what's the public information.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:22.750 align:middle line:84%
The Federal Reserve
manipulates bonds

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:26.870 align:middle line:84%
with what they call quantitative
easing, operation twist.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.090 align:middle line:84%
The ECB calls it long term
refinancing operations.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:32.030 align:middle line:90%
They call it the swap agreement.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:35.490 align:middle line:84%
The fact is they are in business
to buy bonds and manipulate

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:36.340 align:middle line:90%
the market.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.640 align:middle line:84%
There's also a public
group created in 1987

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.940 align:middle line:84%
by Ronald Reagan right after
the crash, the stock crash,

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.570 align:middle line:84%
called the President's Working
Group on Financial Markets.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.090 align:middle line:90%
You can Google it.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.250 align:middle line:90%
It's very well defined.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:52.490 align:middle line:84%
It involves the leaders
of the SEC, and the CFTC,

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:53.740 align:middle line:90%
and banking leaders.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And their job is to prop
up the stock market.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a
government agency.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:02.170 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing-- George
Stephanopoulos admitted to it,

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.000 align:middle line:84%
talked about it openly
a few years ago.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.850 align:middle line:90%
It's real.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:07.960 align:middle line:84%
There's also an organization,
a government organization,

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.780 align:middle line:84%
called the Exchange
Stabilization Fund.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.990 align:middle line:90%
It's been around 70, 80 years.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Its job, its mandate,
is to manipulate

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:16.930 align:middle line:84%
foreign currency
and gold and silver.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.290 align:middle line:90%
That's what it says.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:19.130 align:middle line:90%
So, the fact is--

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.089 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To manipulate--
manage or manipulate.

00:12:21.089 --> 00:12:22.879 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, they
would call it manage.

00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: OK.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.840 align:middle line:84%
But my point is that these
organizations, people call

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.280 align:middle line:84%
me a conspiracy
theorist, but I'm not.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm a scientist when
it comes to finance.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're just
calling it like it is.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is in
the United States,

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.140 align:middle line:84%
we actually have names
for these organizations.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.262 align:middle line:84%
In Europe, which is
a newer organization,

00:12:40.262 --> 00:12:41.720 align:middle line:84%
they're still trying
to figure out.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.270 align:middle line:84%
In fact, every day is a new
reaction to something bad.

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.370 align:middle line:84%
But because they
have 20 countries,

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.420 align:middle line:84%
they don't have
the infrastructure

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.640 align:middle line:84%
to create these organizations
that are formal.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.980 align:middle line:84%
So they have to meet
every couple of weeks.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And say well, now we're creating
the long term refinancing

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:59.830 align:middle line:84%
operation, where we
will support bonds.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Now we'll create
the SMP, which is

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:07.060 align:middle line:84%
some British term with the
British language with the oldie

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and stuff like that to describe
how buy government bonds.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And so these things have
been around forever.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Now when it comes
to gold, which is

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:18.200 align:middle line:84%
my particular area
of expertise, it's

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.110 align:middle line:84%
been manipulated, suppressed,
for the past 1,000, 5,000

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.610 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Any time there's
been a government

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.460 align:middle line:84%
that wanted to
control the currency,

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.810 align:middle line:90%
they suppress the price of gold.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:29.070 align:middle line:90%
First they take it.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:30.395 align:middle line:90%
And then they suppress.

00:13:30.395 --> 00:13:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They've
confiscated it in the past.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And that did happen, I
think, in '33, right?

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.562 align:middle line:84%
but again, nothing was
actually taken from anyone.

00:13:37.562 --> 00:13:38.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No it wasn't.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.229 align:middle line:90%
Now explain that.

00:13:39.229 --> 00:13:41.894 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what-- you always
read that gold was confiscated.

00:13:41.894 --> 00:13:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
actually happened.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.901 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: It's one
of the few things

00:13:44.901 --> 00:13:47.130 align:middle line:84%
that people who know
nothing seem to know.

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:48.020 align:middle line:90%
And they come at me.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.185 align:middle line:84%
I won't buy gold because
it was confiscated.

00:13:50.185 --> 00:13:51.770 align:middle line:90%
It will get confiscated again.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Now in 1933, we were in the
middle of the Great Depression.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And FDR had just
come into office.

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And he put out a
decree that says,

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:06.122 align:middle line:84%
you must give in your gold
for the fixed price of $20.67.

00:14:06.122 --> 00:14:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Because we were still
on a gold standard.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:08.871 align:middle line:90%
That's what it was worth.

00:14:08.871 --> 00:14:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, even before
that decree, there

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.100 align:middle line:84%
were public calls
for patriotism.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.450 align:middle line:90%
We need to help the country.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.420 align:middle line:84%
The country can't-- again,
when you have a gold standard,

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:21.810 align:middle line:84%
you can't spend like on the
Tennessee Valley Authority

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:23.234 align:middle line:90%
without gold in hand.

00:14:23.234 --> 00:14:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:24.790 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: That's
the beauty of it.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:25.870 align:middle line:90%
You can't create debt.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.240 align:middle line:90%
You can't spend without it.

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.300 align:middle line:84%
So there were kind of
public calls for patriotism.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Turn in your gold and
we'll give you money.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:34.890 align:middle line:90%
And this was before the decree.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And people gave it
in hand over fist.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:36.751 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:38.260 align:middle line:90%
So this was voluntary.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:39.744 align:middle line:90%
It was the spirit of the times.

00:14:39.744 --> 00:14:40.910 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Before 1933, yes.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:41.686 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It wasn't
as though you

00:14:41.686 --> 00:14:43.144 align:middle line:84%
had he police
knocking on your door

00:14:43.144 --> 00:14:44.489 align:middle line:90%
taking your gold away from you.

00:14:44.489 --> 00:14:47.030 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFFMAN: And again, at that
time there was a gold standard.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:50.690 align:middle line:84%
Every gold-- every dollar
said on it payable to

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:53.120 align:middle line:90%
for X amount of ounces of gold.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.630 align:middle line:84%
So if the government
said, we really

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.580 align:middle line:90%
need to expand our spending.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.227 align:middle line:90%
Can you just give us your gold.

00:14:58.227 --> 00:15:00.060 align:middle line:84%
We'll give you dollars
that are gold backed.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.020 align:middle line:90%
People were like, fine.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.686 align:middle line:84%
We can just get them
back in the future.

00:15:02.686 --> 00:15:04.230 align:middle line:90%
They're gold backed.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Of course, what he did was
after he made the decree, all

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:11.390 align:middle line:84%
the gold that had been
given to them, they said A,

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:12.550 align:middle line:90%
you can't have it back.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.270 align:middle line:90%
It's now illegal to own it.

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And B, we're now
valuing at $35 an ounce.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.890 align:middle line:84%
So we get twice the
value that you had.

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:21.360 align:middle line:90%
And you can't have it back.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.300 align:middle line:84%
So the people learned back
then that the government

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.240 align:middle line:84%
is liars, or are
liars, back then.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Which is-- so and even
after that happened,

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:32.156 align:middle line:90%
they didn't take anyone's gold.

00:15:32.156 --> 00:15:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Even after they said OK, it's
now $35.00 an ounce and you

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:37.170 align:middle line:84%
can't have it, not a single
ounce was ever taken.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Even there was some
misnomers that they

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.555 align:middle line:84%
went into safe deposit
box and took them.

00:15:41.555 --> 00:15:42.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hmhm.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:42.679 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:15:42.679 --> 00:15:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: They didn't.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.180 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I would
never put any in a bank.

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.140 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't put a dollar in a
bank, let alone my valuables,

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.421 align:middle line:90%
like a gold bar.

00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:51.920 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is
they never took any.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.570 align:middle line:90%
There was actually one lawsuit.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Someone sued because
the government

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.480 align:middle line:84%
got a hold of their
gold in some kind

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.970 align:middle line:84%
of legal arrange--
legal lawsuit.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no
you can't have it.

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.999 align:middle line:84%
The judges said you can't
take the person's gold.

00:16:04.999 --> 00:16:06.790 align:middle line:84%
So no one ever actually
had it confiscated.

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And in today's world,
for a million reasons,

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:11.756 align:middle line:84%
I think it's insane
to even comprehend.

00:16:11.756 --> 00:16:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But like
you just said,

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:14.590 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't put
money in a vault,

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.835 align:middle line:84%
in a safe deposit
box in the bank.

00:16:16.835 --> 00:16:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: No, I
wouldn't put anything.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.543 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why, I mean why.

00:16:19.543 --> 00:16:22.360 align:middle line:84%
If it couldn't be confiscated,
why would you not trust them?

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.693 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, I don't trust
the banks for any reasons

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:27.500 align:middle line:84%
because the banks are the people
who have been stealing from us.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And again, the banks and the
government are one in the same.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And when you say JP
Morgan, like people

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.810 align:middle line:84%
say oh, JP Morgan, the
short or the silver?

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:35.960 align:middle line:90%
It's not JP Morgan.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.170 align:middle line:90%
It's the government.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you have your
stuff in a bank,

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:41.890 align:middle line:84%
that means you're leaving your
possessions in the government's

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:42.450 align:middle line:90%
hands.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And you know what governments
do with people's possessions.

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:46.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Now-- so we're not
in a-- we're not

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.690 align:middle line:84%
participating in a free market
on any level from what you just

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:53.620 align:middle line:90%
told us, not really.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: No, no.

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:56.130 align:middle line:90%
Some places more than others.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:58.070 align:middle line:90%
United States, zero.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And yet we feel
like we have the right

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.800 align:middle line:84%
to invest in a stock, or invest
in a bond if we'd like to.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.170 align:middle line:90%
And there's your free market.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:08.190 align:middle line:90%
We have the freedom to invest.

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:11.026 align:middle line:84%
And here we have a market
that a little while back,

00:17:11.026 --> 00:17:12.900 align:middle line:84%
a few years ago, it
dropped all the way down,

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.430 align:middle line:84%
as I recall to
something like 7,000.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.310 align:middle line:90%
Now it's back up to 13.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And everyone sees if
you just sit on it,

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:21.390 align:middle line:84%
the free market will
take care of itself.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:22.589 align:middle line:90%
It's all bounce back.

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:23.755 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Isn't that funny?

00:17:23.755 --> 00:17:25.510 align:middle line:90%
The Dow is up to 13,000.

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:27.589 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, in
real terms, if you

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:31.740 align:middle line:84%
use what real inflation is,
it's probably down about 70%

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.760 align:middle line:90%
in the past 10 years.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.130 align:middle line:84%
If you look at what real
inflation is, and oh,

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.940 align:middle line:84%
by the way, if you include the
four companies that have been

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:42.400 align:middle line:84%
bankrupted or reorganized,
General Motors, Citigroup, AIG,

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.060 align:middle line:84%
and Eastman Kodak, the Dow
would be probably 10,000 and not

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:46.630 align:middle line:90%
13,000.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:47.730 align:middle line:90%
But that's just--

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But I mean,
my understanding is also

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:54.450 align:middle line:84%
that the data on a daily
basis is also manipulated,

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.120 align:middle line:84%
in that the companies that
aren't performing so well

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.890 align:middle line:84%
might be taken
out of the listing

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.780 align:middle line:84%
and you edge over the ones that
maybe had a better day just

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.530 align:middle line:84%
to prop whatever number
you want up there.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: That's what I
mean by GM and Citigroup.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's it.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:06.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:06.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.165 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: It's a survivor bias.

00:18:08.165 --> 00:18:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Survivor bias, OK.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So not only is
the Dow down in real terms,

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:14.050 align:middle line:84%
but if you actually use the
same Dow, it's down also.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:15.820 align:middle line:84%
But you know, the
mainstream media,

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.880 align:middle line:84%
which is part of the
machine, their job

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.420 align:middle line:84%
is tell you the Dow is 13,000
so you should be happy.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:23.860 align:middle line:90%
But the fact is it's 13,000.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:24.690 align:middle line:90%
Big deal.

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:27.310 align:middle line:84%
The average, there was just
an article out a few weeks ago

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:30.670 align:middle line:84%
that says the average median
net worth is down something

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.740 align:middle line:84%
like 40% in the
past five years, OK.

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.770 align:middle line:84%
So clearly the Dow at 13,000
is not helping people, OK.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:40.370 align:middle line:84%
People don't own bond-- you
can't even buy bonds anymore

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.790 align:middle line:90%
because they have no yield.

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Or you could buy a junk
bond and lose your money.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Or you could buy a
government bond for 0%,

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.150 align:middle line:84%
or in Switzerland for
negative 0.5% and pay them.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.530 align:middle line:84%
So whether you buy or
sell a bond or a stock,

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:57.390 align:middle line:84%
remember that the government
has a printing press

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.540 align:middle line:84%
and is always on the
other side of the trade,

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.680 align:middle line:84%
buying what you're selling,
or selling what you're buying.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I recommend
people to stay away,

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:08.280 align:middle line:84%
long or short, from
everything paper.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Now this morning, I
was reading an article

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:16.650 align:middle line:84%
in the paper that was saying in
2007 when the poop hit the fan,

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.810 align:middle line:84%
was there some element
of that was temporarily

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:26.680 align:middle line:84%
reenacted that is it due to go
off December 31st this year?

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Or FDIC was to continue its
extending its protections.

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:34.294 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, what is this.

00:19:34.294 --> 00:19:35.460 align:middle line:90%
You can see what I'm saying.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Because I can't
remember the details.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: When
that happened, when

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:44.780 align:middle line:84%
what I call Global Meltdown
One occurred in late 2008,

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.750 align:middle line:84%
it took the government
by surprise.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:51.500 align:middle line:84%
They were not prepared for
everything to hit the fan,

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.200 align:middle line:84%
because they thought, hey, we
just repealed Glass Steagall.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.410 align:middle line:90%
These banks are doing great.

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a real
state boom going on.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.120 align:middle line:90%
Everything's well.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.750 align:middle line:84%
They were in the middle
of an election cycle

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.166 align:middle line:84%
on top of that
where you just talk

00:20:02.166 --> 00:20:03.850 align:middle line:90%
about how great everything is.

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.797 align:middle line:84%
So they were taken
by surprise when

00:20:06.797 --> 00:20:08.880 align:middle line:84%
the real estate-- it was
basically the real estate

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.220 align:middle line:84%
bubble blowing up
that caused that.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:16.170 align:middle line:84%
The derivatives created by
the 1999 repeal of the Glass

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Steagall is what made the
bubble in real estate that

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.060 align:middle line:90%
much more lethal.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.500 align:middle line:10%
And so when it came down and
all the derivatives came down

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:28.370 align:middle line:10%
with it, like AIG for
instance, and Citigroup,

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.770 align:middle line:10%
and Bear Stearns,
and Lehman Brothers,

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.740 align:middle line:10%
they were taken by surprise.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:36.660 align:middle line:10%
So their initial reaction
was just print, print, print.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.610 align:middle line:90%
You can call it tarp.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:43.040 align:middle line:84%
You can call it increasing
the size of FDIC and SIPC.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.040 align:middle line:84%
You can call it the
various housing programs

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.969 align:middle line:84%
they created to-- with the
first time mortgage, what

00:20:50.969 --> 00:20:52.510 align:middle line:84%
do they call it,
the first time buyer

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:54.520 align:middle line:84%
where you get all
the tax credits.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.080 align:middle line:84%
They were just giving
away money basically.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And for a couple
years it worked.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Because people were so shocked
and awed by all the money

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:04.540 align:middle line:90%
that was printed.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And they ran up the
stock market again,

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.940 align:middle line:84%
that they thought
everything was fine.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And then kind of like taking the
painkiller off, once it wears

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.464 align:middle line:84%
down, you realize that your
bone is just as broken.

00:21:16.464 --> 00:21:18.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's a lot more
broken because you've

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:22.150 align:middle line:84%
been walking on this broken
bone for a couple of years.

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:24.100 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we stand today.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And all they know how to
do is just give themselves

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:27.450 align:middle line:90%
more drugs.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so essentially
at this time let's talk

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.300 align:middle line:90%
about FDIC for moment.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that's-- with
everything going on, people are

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.060 align:middle line:90%
thinking, well jeez.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.060 align:middle line:84%
At least my savings or
whatever I have left,

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.470 align:middle line:90%
it may not be drawing interest.

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.770 align:middle line:84%
But if one of these
banks collapses,

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:47.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm still protected
under the FDIC coverage.

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well that's assuming
the bank is still there.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Because banks tend
to freeze assets.

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.360 align:middle line:84%
You just saw it in
Spain two weeks ago,

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.360 align:middle line:90%
a company called Bankia.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.245 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the biggest
banks in all of Spain, froze.

00:21:59.245 --> 00:21:59.870 align:middle line:90%
They closed it.

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:01.310 align:middle line:84%
The government had
to nationalize it.

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:02.090 align:middle line:90%
There's one in Italy.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:02.970 align:middle line:90%
I forgot what it's called.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.011 align:middle line:90%
It's a long Italian name.

00:22:04.011 --> 00:22:06.200 align:middle line:84%
It's been in the
state of what they

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.197 align:middle line:84%
call bank holiday
for two months now.

00:22:08.197 --> 00:22:09.280 align:middle line:90%
You can't get your assets.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.610 align:middle line:84%
We've seen in Russia
the largest bank

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.430 align:middle line:84%
in the country, for I think
two weeks last month, stop

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.030 align:middle line:84%
processing credit
cards, debit cards.

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:16.613 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:16.613 --> 00:22:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So people
who relied on that

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:20.590 align:middle line:90%
couldn't pay for things.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.500 align:middle line:84%
So for one, you're
assuming the banks

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.150 align:middle line:90%
are going to still stay open.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And two, you're assuming
that your money in the bank,

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:31.740 align:middle line:84%
that there won't be fees,
that they won't just

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.260 align:middle line:90%
confiscate it like MF Global.

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.630 align:middle line:90%
Say oh, those funds.

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Oh sorry, those funds
were not segregated.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:40.510 align:middle line:90%
JP Morgan had them.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:42.030 align:middle line:84%
You'll have to get
them from them.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:43.657 align:middle line:90%
So you're holding your money.

00:22:43.657 --> 00:22:45.490 align:middle line:84%
People hold their money
in a bank right now.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:46.614 align:middle line:90%
You're getting no interest.

00:22:46.614 --> 00:22:49.080 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, no interest.

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:49.622 align:middle line:90%
And for what?

00:22:49.622 --> 00:22:50.871 align:middle line:90%
What are you getting for that?

00:22:50.871 --> 00:22:53.310 align:middle line:84%
You're getting it to-- you're
letting these companies who

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.910 align:middle line:90%
no longer are commercial banks.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.330 align:middle line:84%
Now they're just banks
that can speculate because

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.440 align:middle line:90%
of the repeal of Glass Steagall.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.355 align:middle line:90%
They speculate with your money.

00:23:01.355 --> 00:23:03.730 align:middle line:84%
The government says sure,
we'll give you your money back.

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:05.640 align:middle line:84%
But you may not get
your money back.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.630 align:middle line:90%
The bank may spend it all.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:09.620 align:middle line:90%
Or invested it all and lose it.

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So theoretically,
am I hearing this correctly,

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:17.690 align:middle line:84%
that theoretically FDIC
extends to all banks,

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:19.710 align:middle line:84%
including those that
would previously

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:22.040 align:middle line:84%
have been called
investment banks?

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.486 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: It's a murky
line now of what is a bank

00:23:24.486 --> 00:23:25.110 align:middle line:90%
and what's not.

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:28.640 align:middle line:84%
In fact, TARP, when
that came out in 2008,

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.560 align:middle line:90%
Term Asset Reduction Program.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.190 align:middle line:90%
I forgot what it stands for.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.760 align:middle line:84%
But it was basically just
giving money to the banks.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Now two banks, Goldman
Sachs and Morgan Stanley,

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.660 align:middle line:84%
were considered
investment banks,

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.700 align:middle line:84%
which means they're
not really banks.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.220 align:middle line:84%
So the government said to
them, OK, we want to save you.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.110 align:middle line:84%
So as of tomorrow,
you're a bank.

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:52.800 align:middle line:84%
They literally overnight said,
so you're eligible for TARP.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So we'll print money
and give it to you.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.670 align:middle line:90%
And yes, you're saved.

00:23:56.670 --> 00:24:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Now how did that money help
the Goldman Sachs clients?

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:02.100 align:middle line:90%
Didn't help them any.

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.110 align:middle line:84%
The bank just took the money and
paid record bonuses that year,

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.665 align:middle line:84%
if you can believe--
record bonuses.

00:24:06.665 --> 00:24:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I remember.

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And they only
did it, because remember,

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.430 align:middle line:90%
that was the fall.

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:10.760 align:middle line:90%
So that was bonus season.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.209 align:middle line:84%
So no one got any
money from that.

00:24:13.209 --> 00:24:15.875 align:middle line:84%
I guess you could say if you had
a brokerage account of $100,000

00:24:15.875 --> 00:24:17.917 align:middle line:90%
that it's still there.

00:24:17.917 --> 00:24:19.500 align:middle line:84%
But of course, you
lost all your money

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.680 align:middle line:84%
in the markets because of
Goldman Sachs recommendations.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:26.660 align:middle line:84%
I remember Goldman Sachs also
happened to be sued and lost,

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.970 align:middle line:84%
of course it was a hand
slap, for creating securities

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:32.670 align:middle line:84%
to sell to their clients
and then shorting them.

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:33.822 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:24:33.822 --> 00:24:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So that's
what you get--

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:35.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I mean really.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: For your
SIPC protection.

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
really criminal.

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.060 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking about
is criminal behavior.

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Whether the government chooses
to prosecute and follow

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:49.010 align:middle line:84%
through or label it
that, it is criminal.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you're looking
at quantitative easing,

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:52.760 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.844 align:middle line:90%
I was thinking about this.

00:24:53.844 --> 00:24:55.635 align:middle line:84%
I was just trying to
get my mind around it.

00:24:55.635 --> 00:24:56.970 align:middle line:90%
Because this is not my language.

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.400 align:middle line:90%
This is tricky stuff.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, how is,
functionally speaking, what

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:05.940 align:middle line:84%
they did by printing money
through quantitative easing

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:09.070 align:middle line:84%
any different than if one of us
were to counterfeit our money

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:10.680 align:middle line:90%
and flood it into the system?

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: There's not
a difference at all.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And again, you're
saying it's criminal.

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:15.970 align:middle line:90%
You wonder about the government.

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:17.178 align:middle line:90%
Why would they let it happen?

00:25:17.178 --> 00:25:18.899 align:middle line:84%
Again, the government
and Goldman Sachs

00:25:18.899 --> 00:25:19.690 align:middle line:90%
are the same thing.

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: One and the same, yes.

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: It's literally
the same people.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, the head of the
Federal Reserve of New York

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.882 align:middle line:84%
is the former Goldman
Chief Economist right now.

00:25:27.882 --> 00:25:29.340 align:middle line:84%
We were talking
about Robert Rubin,

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.920 align:middle line:84%
who was the chairman
of Goldman Sachs.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.520 align:middle line:84%
He became the Secretary of
the Treasury, Rahm Emanuel,

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.580 align:middle line:90%
and the list goes on.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.980 align:middle line:84%
If I had time, I could list
all the people currently.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.830 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the prime
minister-- I'm sorry.

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:44.120 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the prime minister
of Italy, Mario Monte,

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.070 align:middle line:84%
he was a former
Goldman Sachs guy, OK.

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:50.430 align:middle line:84%
And the guy who's going to
be the new Bank of England

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.450 align:middle line:90%
head, former Goldman Sachs guy.

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:55.050 align:middle line:84%
So these guys are
one in the same.

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:56.855 align:middle line:90%
They rape and pillage.

00:25:56.855 --> 00:25:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
a global cartel.

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes, it
is a global cartel.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not sim-- it's
not just about gold or about

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:06.950 align:middle line:90%
stocks.

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:09.860 align:middle line:84%
It's about basically
taking everything from you

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:13.190 align:middle line:84%
so that, you know, you
beg people like Obama

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:16.430 align:middle line:84%
to give you Obamacare,
which has to be

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:17.719 align:middle line:90%
funded by more printed money.

00:26:17.719 --> 00:26:19.510 align:middle line:84%
See that's where the
Ponzi scheme comes in.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:21.650 align:middle line:84%
That's their weakness,
is the paper money.

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:24.120 align:middle line:90%
You can't print it forever.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, why not?

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.240 align:middle line:90%
They've been doing it for years.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what people
keep saying is, looks OK to me.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.720 align:middle line:90%
I haven't lost my job yet.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.292 align:middle line:84%
Of course, your
mother has moved back

00:26:33.292 --> 00:26:34.500 align:middle line:90%
in because she lost her home.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Your kids move back in because
they can't find any work.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.030 align:middle line:90%
But still it looks normal.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:41.827 align:middle line:84%
You still have some things
on the shelves at Walmart.

00:26:41.827 --> 00:26:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, you-- and I
don't mean you personally--

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.902 align:middle line:90%
but you may still have your job.

00:26:45.902 --> 00:26:47.860 align:middle line:84%
But the real unemployment
rate in this country,

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.490 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking
about the real rate,

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:52.590 align:middle line:84%
meaning people who can't
afford to pay their bills,

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:54.460 align:middle line:90%
is closer to 20, 25%.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's only
going to get worse.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And yes, they can
keep printing money.

00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:59.340 align:middle line:90%
They have.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.450 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of the government
statistics, the CPI,

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:04.960 align:middle line:84%
the Consumer Price Index,
that's their statistics which

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.330 align:middle line:84%
are heavily
understated, the dollar

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:09.770 align:middle line:84%
has lost 98% of its
purchasing power

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:11.670 align:middle line:84%
since the Federal
Reserve was created.

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:15.950 align:middle line:84%
It's lost 50% since we went
off the gold standard in 1970.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:17.424 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
what they tell you.

00:27:17.424 --> 00:27:19.340 align:middle line:84%
They tell you we printed
this amount of money.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:20.690 align:middle line:90%
You know they've printed more.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:22.140 align:middle line:84%
They tell you this is
the inflation rate.

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:22.990 align:middle line:90%
You know it's more.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Just like they tell you we
have 8,133 tons of gold,

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:29.020 align:middle line:84%
which anyone in my
world knows they don't.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:30.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Where'd it go?

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: They leased
it and sold it secretly

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:34.800 align:middle line:84%
to maintain the
value of the dollar.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.780 align:middle line:90%
That's their Achilles heel.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Because gold and
silver are real money.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.450 align:middle line:90%
And they always have been.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And what I say when people
ask about that, I say look.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:47.450 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're the number one--
you're literally Joe six pack,

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:48.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:49.970 align:middle line:84%
You don't work in the
financial industry.

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:51.410 align:middle line:90%
You don't have much money.

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:53.590 align:middle line:84%
You know nothing about
financial markets.

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:55.530 align:middle line:84%
There's probably
two things that are

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:57.780 align:middle line:84%
ingrained in your
DNA about markets.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:00.780 align:middle line:84%
One is the Dow Jones
Industrial Average,

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:04.470 align:middle line:84%
which is supposedly a barometer
of the health of the nation,

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:05.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:06.364 align:middle line:90%
And you also know about gold.

00:28:06.364 --> 00:28:08.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've been
watching what's happened.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.350 align:middle line:84%
All of us have been watching
what's happened with gold.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:12.141 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
have migrated that way,

00:28:12.141 --> 00:28:14.470 align:middle line:84%
have gotten out of the
markets and moved toward gold.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And it went as high
as, what was it?

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.900 align:middle line:90%
Just under 2,000 a while back.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's back down around 1,600.

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:24.540 align:middle line:84%
But it's interesting because
just as the world is becoming

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.160 align:middle line:84%
even less stable,
everything's coming unglued.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Bad news everywhere,
which normally you

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.760 align:middle line:84%
should see the gold
going like that.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.140 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not really moving.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:37.390 align:middle line:84%
It's been stuck in the same
place for a couple months now.

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.360 align:middle line:90%
What's actually happening?

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.260 align:middle line:84%
Are those fixed
too, those prices

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.820 align:middle line:84%
fixed too-- the gold
market, silver market?

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, first
I'd say that I disagree

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:47.970 align:middle line:90%
that people are watching gold.

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:49.600 align:middle line:90%
You may be watching personally.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.160 align:middle line:10%
And you probably did some
research for the show,

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.960 align:middle line:10%
but from my experience
in the world,

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.180 align:middle line:10%
probably one out of
1,000 people even

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.850 align:middle line:10%
has knowledge that gold is
a market that's tradeable.

00:28:58.850 --> 00:28:59.140 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Seriously.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.140 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFFMAN: Let alone to
understand what it means

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.700 align:middle line:10%
or how to buy it.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:07.110 align:middle line:10%
So as far as your second
question, is it manipulated?

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.350 align:middle line:84%
There is no market
more manipulated

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:10.780 align:middle line:90%
than the precious metals.

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Because as I mentioned
before, they're

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.530 align:middle line:90%
the linchpin of the system.

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:17.870 align:middle line:84%
They are the barometer
of something being wrong.

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so here it's stuck
around 1,600, up or down $20

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:25.100 align:middle line:84%
as the weeks have
gone on, I've noticed.

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And yet I've read over
the last few years,

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.590 align:middle line:84%
many people I've talked to
on the subject have said,

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:35.320 align:middle line:84%
realistically, gold should
be over 2,000, 2,500, $3,000.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:36.947 align:middle line:84%
In real terms, that
should be where

00:29:36.947 --> 00:29:40.150 align:middle line:90%
it-- that's where it should be.

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:42.920 align:middle line:10%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, first of all,
again we talked about the Dow

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.710 align:middle line:10%
at 13,000, how everyone's
crowing about it.

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:49.450 align:middle line:10%
The Dow was 13,000 12 years ago.

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:52.850 align:middle line:10%
And that's again, that's
the pre-Citigroup Dow.

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:54.810 align:middle line:10%
And that's not
including inflation.

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:56.590 align:middle line:10%
Just on an absolute
basis, the Dow

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:58.070 align:middle line:10%
is the same as it
was 12 years ago.

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:00.780 align:middle line:10%
But the mainstream media, every
time it goes up 20 points,

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.240 align:middle line:10%
talks about how
great it's doing.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.110 align:middle line:10%
It hasn't gone anywhere.

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Gold has been up for
12 years in a row.

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Gold was up last year
after they smashed it

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:10.740 align:middle line:84%
down purposely, the
government, after it

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.520 align:middle line:90%
hit that high in September.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.870 align:middle line:90%
It was up 13%.

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Gold has been, this year
because the system is getting so

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.420 align:middle line:84%
near the end, and so
frayed, and the currencies

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.010 align:middle line:84%
are being over printed,
and the debt is spiraling,

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:24.950 align:middle line:84%
I have never seen
in my life anything

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:27.140 align:middle line:84%
like what we see in the
suppression this year.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.590 align:middle line:90%
And still, gold is up this year.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:33.080 align:middle line:84%
It's very resilient because
underlying the paper that they

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.850 align:middle line:84%
are naked shorting, which means
basically selling things that--

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell us
about shorting.

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:38.750 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't
understand shorting.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:39.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: OK.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Shorting, if you
go all the way back

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:45.410 align:middle line:84%
to the '70s when it was created,
maybe even the late '60s when

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:47.970 align:middle line:84%
it was created, it was
really, once again,

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:50.420 align:middle line:90%
a banking invention for fees.

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Basically it allows you to
borrow someone else's shares,

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:59.300 align:middle line:84%
or gold, or bonds, and bet
that they will go down,

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.240 align:middle line:84%
wherein where you'd buy them
back and then return the shares

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.350 align:middle line:84%
and pay the brokerage a
fee for that lending that's

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.520 align:middle line:90%
called margin.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.910 align:middle line:84%
But as time went
on, people started

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:12.760 align:middle line:84%
to use shorting in
a more sinister way.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Once the banks realized
that they can kind of double

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:20.410 align:middle line:84%
the market, meaning you have
people buying on one side.

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And then you have--
you're creating shares

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:24.500 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
to sell, you're

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.930 align:middle line:90%
creating more commissions.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And so they started
to promote it heavily.

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, there
became the manipulation.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Once governments-- once the
US government, in particular,

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.860 align:middle line:84%
realized that they
can naked short,

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.474 align:middle line:84%
which means create
shares and gold, paper--

00:31:40.474 --> 00:31:42.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That don't
exist in real gold.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: That
don't exist, yeah.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.180 align:middle line:84%
There are laws that
say you can't do it.

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.180 align:middle line:90%
But that's what they do.

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:47.605 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I
was going to say,

00:31:47.605 --> 00:31:49.800 align:middle line:84%
it sounds-- another thing
that sounds illegal to me,

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:50.700 align:middle line:90%
I mean should be illegal.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.158 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: It's
completely illegal.

00:31:52.158 --> 00:31:54.159 align:middle line:90%
But that's what they do.

00:31:54.159 --> 00:31:55.200 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's very simple.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.010 align:middle line:84%
They just put in an order
and say sell paper gold,

00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:01.300 align:middle line:84%
sell stocks, sell gold mining
shares, whatever it is.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:02.550 align:middle line:90%
And the market goes down.

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And since the CFTC,
which is the commodities

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:08.010 align:middle line:84%
regulator, and the SEC,
which is the stock regulator,

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:11.390 align:middle line:84%
are all part of the same team,
they do whatever they want.

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:14.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure it won't surprise you
that the CFTC, which again,

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.710 align:middle line:84%
they regulate commodities, is
run by a former Goldman Sachs

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:18.820 align:middle line:90%
executive.

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And the same will go across
all of these agencies, which

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.651 align:middle line:90%
are supposedly regulatory.

00:32:25.651 --> 00:32:26.150 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It doesn't
sound like there's

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.207 align:middle line:84%
much regulation of any
kind going on, though.

00:32:29.207 --> 00:32:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: No.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:31.710 align:middle line:10%
No, in fact, they
created this thing

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:34.640 align:middle line:10%
called Dodd-Frank about three
or four years ago, which

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.520 align:middle line:10%
celebrated its second or third
anniversary a week or two ago.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.380 align:middle line:10%
It hasn't even
been finished yet.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.211 align:middle line:10%
So they crow about how they're
creating regulation to help.

00:32:43.211 --> 00:32:44.960 align:middle line:10%
But they don't even
finish the regulation.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.530 align:middle line:10%
I think it's something like
2000 pages and growing.

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:49.640 align:middle line:10%
But it hasn't
regulated anything.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And the point is, it's
not going to be regulated.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.350 align:middle line:84%
The whole point is the
banks and the government

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:56.940 align:middle line:84%
have now become so
powerful that they realize

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:58.660 align:middle line:84%
that they don't
have to regulate.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.870 align:middle line:84%
The average person
doesn't have the money

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:03.280 align:middle line:84%
to even protect themself,
let alone the will

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.990 align:middle line:84%
to try to figure out the
complexities of derivatives

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:07.960 align:middle line:84%
and naked shorting
and algorithms,

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:11.320 align:middle line:84%
which are computer programs that
are used to manipulate markets.

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:14.594 align:middle line:84%
And it gets to the point where
people just throw in the flag.

00:33:14.594 --> 00:33:17.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, even a few years ago,
they might be looking at the TV

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.457 align:middle line:84%
and saying oh, well
the Dow is going up.

00:33:19.457 --> 00:33:20.540 align:middle line:90%
I guess things are better.

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.420 align:middle line:84%
People don't even look
at the Dow anymore.

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:25.490 align:middle line:90%
In fact, there's been outflows.

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:27.640 align:middle line:84%
They have statistics
that measure people's

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.950 align:middle line:84%
inflows and outflows
into mutual funds.

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And they've been net outflow
I think for two straight years

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:33.920 align:middle line:90%
every single month.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.170 align:middle line:84%
So when you see
the Dow going up,

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:39.260 align:middle line:84%
you got to say well,
who's buying it.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.990 align:middle line:90%
And the same goes with gold.

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:44.220 align:middle line:84%
You say well, why is it
not going up this year?

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Why does it seem like every
time something wildly bullish

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:50.870 align:middle line:84%
for gold happens, it just
plummets $20.00 in 10 seconds.

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:51.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:51.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:53.825 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And it's the
same reason; the government

00:33:53.825 --> 00:33:57.460 align:middle line:84%
is creating paper on one side
to support things that it likes.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's creating
paper on the other side

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.934 align:middle line:84%
to manipulate the price
of things it doesn't like.

00:34:01.934 --> 00:34:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
is the advantage

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:05.650 align:middle line:84%
of manipulating
the price of gold

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:08.382 align:middle line:84%
downward and
keeping a lid on it?

00:34:08.382 --> 00:34:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Because it
keeps it out of the news.

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:13.929 align:middle line:84%
When people see gold going
up, even the mainstream media

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:16.800 align:middle line:84%
will be forced to write
inflation expectations,

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.760 align:middle line:90%
inflation fears.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:21.520 align:middle line:84%
The government, the Fed's
policies are not working.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.429 align:middle line:90%
The Fed is supposedly in charge.

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:25.440 align:middle line:84%
They supposedly
know what's right.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.520 align:middle line:90%
And so they must keep it down.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.659 align:middle line:84%
Because there's such a tiny
supply of gold in the world.

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:34.406 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's probably only
a couple of trillion dollars

00:34:34.406 --> 00:34:36.750 align:middle line:90%
of gold that's ever been mined.

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Of course, almost all of
it is hidden in vaults

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.909 align:middle line:90%
that you'll never see again.

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:43.969 align:middle line:84%
As far as silver, there's only
about a billion ounces above

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:48.000 align:middle line:84%
ground existing, because most of
it's been depleted by industry.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.219 align:middle line:84%
A billion ounces is
worth $30 billion.

00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:53.510 align:middle line:84%
I think there's 1,200
billionaires in the world.

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And there's probably 10
times as many corporations

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:59.170 align:middle line:84%
that could take that
supply out, much of which,

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:01.310 align:middle line:84%
again, is sitting in
vaults, never to be used.

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:05.265 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very fine line about
the physical supply of gold

00:35:05.265 --> 00:35:07.720 align:middle line:84%
and silver, and the
paper naked shorting

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.140 align:middle line:90%
that tries to hold them down.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.639 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And let's
talk about that.

00:35:10.639 --> 00:35:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Because now once you
realize the fraud

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.350 align:middle line:84%
that was going on in the world,
including in your own life,

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:19.570 align:middle line:84%
including among your fellow
employees and your bosses

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:21.950 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, you decided
to get out of the game.

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And other people I've
interviewed did the same thing.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And the first
place they went was

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:29.820 align:middle line:84%
anything-- go to high ground,
go to higher ground, which

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:32.410 align:middle line:90%
was to gold and silver.

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And so now that's
really what you do.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.580 align:middle line:84%
That's a big part
of your life is

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:39.530 align:middle line:84%
gold and silver, and the
marketing of gold and silver.

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:42.240 align:middle line:84%
So let's just be upfront about
that, and it's for a reason.

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Because that was the only safe
place you could see to go.

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:45.326 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:35:45.326 --> 00:35:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Gold and silver is
the highest ground.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The highest
ground, right.

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: I mean, there is
no other ground even close.

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And I agree.

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:54.410 align:middle line:84%
From everything I've seen,
read, and looked into,

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:57.530 align:middle line:84%
it seems that's a very
clear and true statement.

00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:00.650 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk about real
gold and its value right

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:04.240 align:middle line:84%
now, today, as opposed to paper
gold and the manipulated gold

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.110 align:middle line:90%
prices.

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:07.110 align:middle line:90%
And the same thing with silver.

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, without
being too technical,

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:11.759 align:middle line:84%
the physical price of
gold-- well, I should say,

00:36:11.759 --> 00:36:13.300 align:middle line:84%
the price that you
see on your screen

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.140 align:middle line:90%
for gold is about $1,600.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And the price you see on your
screen for silver is about $28

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:19.320 align:middle line:90%
an ounce.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you will pay
premiums in the real world.

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:23.470 align:middle line:84%
If you want to buy
an ounce of gold,

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:26.300 align:middle line:84%
it'll probably cost
closer to $1,700 today.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:29.400 align:middle line:84%
The premiums for gold and
silver are typically five to 15%

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.660 align:middle line:90%
in normal market conditions.

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.930 align:middle line:84%
But we've seen them
blow out-- in 2008,

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:37.330 align:middle line:84%
they got as high as almost
100% in the silver market,

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and not quite that high
in gold, but pretty high.

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:45.530 align:middle line:84%
When people fear it, and when
these manipulations start

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:48.040 align:middle line:84%
to falter, and people
get fear and start

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:51.960 align:middle line:84%
to try to buy the physical
from like firms like my firm,

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.670 align:middle line:90%
then the premiums extend.

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And the mints run out
of gold and silver.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And the delays of when you're
going to get it get larger.

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:05.110 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's a very fine line
of-- that the manipulators are

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:05.610 align:middle line:90%
fighting.

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Because when it goes too
high, we run out of supply.

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:12.510 align:middle line:84%
But when it goes too low,
we do the same thing.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.718 align:middle line:84%
And that's the beauty of
about gold and silver, which

00:37:14.718 --> 00:37:16.270 align:middle line:84%
shows you why it's
not an investment.

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:17.460 align:middle line:90%
But it's money.

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:20.100 align:middle line:84%
The bull market in gold
and silver, which is again,

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.440 align:middle line:84%
it's really just a bear
market in currencies.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not like a
gold coin has gained

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:26.830 align:middle line:90%
in value over the past 10 years.

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:29.300 align:middle line:84%
It's the currencies that
it's being valued in.

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Not just the dollar, the
euro, the rupee, yuan,

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.030 align:middle line:90%
that's been going down in value.

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And what's been causing it,
what's been causing people

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:40.630 align:middle line:84%
to trade in those dollars
and euros for gold and silver

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:42.154 align:middle line:90%
is not greed but fear.

00:37:42.154 --> 00:37:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So when you buy
even land, or certainly

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.520 align:middle line:84%
stocks and bonds,
you're buying it

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.210 align:middle line:90%
because you want to gain value.

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:52.657 align:middle line:84%
You want this thing
to grow in value.

00:37:52.657 --> 00:37:54.490 align:middle line:10%
Whereas with gold, you
buy it because you're

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:57.924 align:middle line:10%
scared that everything else is
going to lose value against it.

00:37:57.924 --> 00:37:58.590 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:00.990 align:middle line:10%
So let's take this
period of time.

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:05.050 align:middle line:10%
And right now, we're talking
it's the beginning of August.

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:06.610 align:middle line:10%
What is happening
with the supplies?

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:08.410 align:middle line:10%
If a person watching
the news going on,

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:11.550 align:middle line:10%
watching what's happening in
Europe right now with Greece,

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:14.540 align:middle line:10%
with Spain, soon
to be Italy, what

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:16.730 align:middle line:10%
is the supply situation
like with gold?

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And what do you expect it to
be over the next few months?

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:20.805 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, it's
been interesting.

00:38:20.805 --> 00:38:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Because again, starting, really
starting September last year

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:28.250 align:middle line:84%
when gold hit $1,920 an ounce,
which was over Labor Day,

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:29.540 align:middle line:90%
literally on Labor Day.

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:30.390 align:middle line:90%
I was watching it.

00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:31.450 align:middle line:84%
And it never trades
on Labor Day.

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You mean when
nobody's paying attention

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:34.230 align:middle line:90%
because we're all at barbecues.

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:35.938 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah, people
were that scared.

00:38:35.938 --> 00:38:38.570 align:middle line:84%
People were actually buying in
those thinly traded computer

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:40.840 align:middle line:90%
markets on Labor Day, OK.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And since that time, that
was during the debt debacle.

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:48.210 align:middle line:84%
That was also during
the last European crash

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:49.810 align:middle line:90%
that was last summer.

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:52.280 align:middle line:84%
When that was happening,
right after that happened,

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.890 align:middle line:84%
the government started
attacking the paper price.

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:57.010 align:middle line:84%
It's been going on
now it's almost a year

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:59.540 align:middle line:90%
like I've never seen before, OK.

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the United States,
they've been so good at it,

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:05.400 align:middle line:84%
it's been so relentless,
that they actually

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.790 align:middle line:84%
have sapped sentiment
a bit this year.

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:10.724 align:middle line:84%
Now I'd say my firm's
sales are about-- last year

00:39:10.724 --> 00:39:11.640 align:middle line:90%
they were record high.

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.015 align:middle line:84%
They're about the
same this year.

00:39:13.015 --> 00:39:13.937 align:middle line:90%
They're not higher.

00:39:13.937 --> 00:39:15.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which considering
what's going on,

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:17.186 align:middle line:84%
they should be
quite a bit higher.

00:39:17.186 --> 00:39:19.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah, but
staying at a record level,

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:21.560 align:middle line:84%
considering that gold
hasn't gone anywhere,

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.260 align:middle line:84%
the efforts that have
been made to keep it down

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.570 align:middle line:84%
should tell you how strong
the underlying demand is.

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:28.460 align:middle line:90%
Now that's only one part of it.

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Again, the other Achilles
heel of these manipulators

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.470 align:middle line:84%
is that gold is priced
in all currencies.

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:38.960 align:middle line:84%
So it's one thing to try
to keep it down in dollars,

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.802 align:middle line:84%
but there's only
300 million people

00:39:40.802 --> 00:39:42.260 align:middle line:84%
in the worl-- in
the United States.

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:43.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
6 plus billion

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.020 align:middle line:84%
around the world who
trade in other currencies.

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Now the euro has been
collapsing against the dollar.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:49.980 align:middle line:90%
So guess what?

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Euro gold is almost
at its all time high.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.519 align:middle line:84%
As we speak, it's
about 5% from it.

00:39:53.519 --> 00:39:54.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it makes sense.

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Whereas, the
US price is 20% below.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.790 align:middle line:84%
So when I say
they're manipulating,

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:00.250 align:middle line:90%
it's not just the US.

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:02.140 align:middle line:84%
It could be people
from Greece alone,

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:04.970 align:middle line:84%
and Spain, who blow
out this cartel,

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:08.160 align:middle line:84%
because they all at once, you
know, the bank runs intensify,

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.470 align:middle line:84%
and they say, we don't
want to be Spanish banks.

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:12.340 align:middle line:90%
We want to be in real money.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And so the point is
it's like putting

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:16.500 align:middle line:90%
the fingers in the dike.

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.740 align:middle line:84%
There's just holes
popping up everywhere.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:22.390 align:middle line:84%
They can't-- for one, they can't
keep the physical price down.

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Because when they push
the paper price too low,

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:26.790 align:middle line:84%
everyone comes to
our firm and buys it.

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:28.360 align:middle line:90%
That's when demand takes off.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.080 align:middle line:84%
And for two, if they try
to make it like, oh, they

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.890 align:middle line:84%
want you to think because
the euro collapsing-- Europe

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:35.720 align:middle line:90%
is collapsing, it's a deflation.

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:38.430 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is when
the euro collapses,

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:40.630 align:middle line:84%
people have
inflation over there.

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:44.650 align:middle line:84%
They had record gasoline
prices in Europe this summer.

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:46.100 align:middle line:90%
So people want to buy gold.

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.340 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's
very, very difficult

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:51.570 align:middle line:84%
for them to just to keep
it flat, like you said,

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:53.270 align:middle line:84%
let alone to keep
it from exploding.

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And yes, what I think
is going to happen,

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.370 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going to
go to levels that people

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:58.020 align:middle line:90%
can't imagine.

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:00.860 align:middle line:84%
But again, there's a difference
between the real value

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:02.310 align:middle line:90%
and the nominal value.

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Because I can do the simple
math and say gold price

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:08.760 align:middle line:84%
should be today $15,000
to $20,000 an ounce.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:10.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: $15,000 to $20,000.

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:13.500 align:middle line:84%
That's not like predicting
a stock will go up.

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:15.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying this is how much
money the government tells you

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:16.760 align:middle line:90%
they've printed.

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Not that they've
actually printed.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:18.760 align:middle line:84%
It's what they tell
you they printed.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So with that ratio,
that should be what it's worth.

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.531 align:middle line:90%
That's what it should be today.

00:41:22.531 --> 00:41:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Of course, each minute
they print another dollar,

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.350 align:middle line:90%
that price target goes up.

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:29.390 align:middle line:84%
So at some point, I believe,
as all fiat currencies do,

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:30.520 align:middle line:90%
the dollar will go.

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:34.364 align:middle line:84%
And gold will become
infinite in current dollars

00:41:34.364 --> 00:41:35.280 align:middle line:90%
for what that's worth.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:38.250 align:middle line:84%
It may cost a zillion dollars
to buy a loaf of bread.

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:40.080 align:middle line:84%
But it will maintain
its purchasing power.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.038 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
talk about hyperinflation

00:41:42.038 --> 00:41:44.422 align:middle line:84%
in real terms, because I
watch all these things.

00:41:44.422 --> 00:41:45.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm curious about
all of them, so I

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.290 align:middle line:90%
do watch all these indicators.

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And I even watch things
like the price of rice

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.140 align:middle line:90%
at the grocery store.

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:52.060 align:middle line:84%
I know what's
happened with rice.

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: I have
it on my screen.

00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:53.270 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:55.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Over the
last three years.

00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And many other things,
toilet paper, all the basics.

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:00.810 align:middle line:84%
If people are not
paying attention,

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:03.610 align:middle line:84%
why don't you fill them in as
to what the actual numbers are

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:05.594 align:middle line:84%
on basics the last two
to three years alone.

00:42:05.594 --> 00:42:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, it's funny
you should mention rice.

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:10.120 align:middle line:84%
I actually wrote
a piece last year.

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.630 align:middle line:84%
I think it was called
something like "The Most

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:15.224 align:middle line:90%
Important Commodity on Earth."

00:42:15.224 --> 00:42:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And everyone thought it was
gold that I was writing about.

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.470 align:middle line:90%
And I said no, it's rice.

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what sustains
the most people in the world.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And the price of rice is not
its all time high right now.

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:28.460 align:middle line:84%
It was last year, but
it's not too far from it.

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And of course, now
agricultural commodities,

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:34.670 align:middle line:84%
inflation is part of
it, but there's also

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:36.460 align:middle line:90%
other factors like this drought.

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:38.235 align:middle line:84%
People don't realize
the price of corn

00:42:38.235 --> 00:42:39.610 align:middle line:84%
is at an all time
high right now.

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:41.820 align:middle line:84%
The price of soybeans is
near an all time high.

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:44.114 align:middle line:84%
The price of wheat
has been surging.

00:42:44.114 --> 00:42:46.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, this may not
affect people on Wall Street,

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:49.130 align:middle line:84%
but it affects people all
over the world, especially

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:52.850 align:middle line:84%
those that don't have currencies
that can be kept stable.

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:54.350 align:middle line:84%
The Indian rupee
right now, everyone

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:57.290 align:middle line:84%
thinks India is such a
wildly amazing country

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:58.510 align:middle line:90%
with their economy growing.

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:00.220 align:middle line:90%
The Indian rupee is collapsing.

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And I mean it's
really, it's down 30%

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:04.170 align:middle line:90%
this year against the dollar.

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:07.197 align:middle line:84%
Again, rupee gold is
near an all time high.

00:43:07.197 --> 00:43:09.030 align:middle line:84%
So again, and after
that, now the government

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:12.590 align:middle line:84%
is trying to keep the people
in India who love gold and hate

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:14.700 align:middle line:84%
rupees, they don't
want them to buy gold.

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:17.540 align:middle line:84%
So you're getting a
combination of inflation,

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:22.580 align:middle line:84%
monetary po-- crazy monetary
policy, draconian government

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:23.540 align:middle line:90%
action all at once.

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:27.380 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is prices of food
are up huge around the world.

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:30.095 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, instead
of itemizing what's up

00:43:30.095 --> 00:43:33.635 align:middle line:84%
and-- because I've noticed
just thumbnail, 100,

00:43:33.635 --> 00:43:35.394 align:middle line:84%
200% on a lot of
our basic items.

00:43:35.394 --> 00:43:36.310 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Absolutely.

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:37.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Over the
last three years.

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.430 align:middle line:90%
100 to 200% percent.

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure people, especially
if someone has lost their job,

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:44.910 align:middle line:84%
or they're on a
fixed income, have

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:46.950 align:middle line:84%
to be noticing the
squeezes on this.

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is even at
the discount markets.

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:53.300 align:middle line:84%
So we're not really--
we haven't tanked yet.

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.360 align:middle line:84%
What do you expect to
see over the next year?

00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And is there any kind of hedge
on just a really simple level,

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:03.190 align:middle line:84%
other than stock-- going to
Costco and buying a couple

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:05.545 align:middle line:84%
jumbo packs, or five
jumbo packs of toilet

00:44:05.545 --> 00:44:06.670 align:middle line:90%
paper and some light bulbs.

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:08.836 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, this is
what I tell everyone to do.

00:44:08.836 --> 00:44:10.760 align:middle line:90%
This is protection 101.

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.339 align:middle line:84%
Forget-- well, I mean you
know, your financial protection

00:44:13.339 --> 00:44:14.130 align:middle line:90%
is gold and silver.

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:16.630 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be ready
for hyperinflation, which

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:18.180 align:middle line:84%
includes higher
prices, and also--

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:20.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you expect
to see hyperinflation?

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Inevitably,
it must happen.

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:24.050 align:middle line:84%
It happens to every
fiat currency.

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:25.370 align:middle line:90%
Every one.

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:27.896 align:middle line:84%
And again, every currency in
the world is a fiat currency.

00:44:27.896 --> 00:44:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And they're all pretty much
anchored to the dollar.

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:31.210 align:middle line:90%
It will happen.

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:34.030 align:middle line:84%
It's only a matter of how
long can the powers that be

00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:35.750 align:middle line:90%
keep the game going.

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And while they keep it going,
it'll be like frogs in a pot.

00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:40.940 align:middle line:84%
You'll still see the
inflation go up, up, up.

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Some places like
India where people

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:45.910 align:middle line:84%
don't seem to care as
much, as least over here,

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:47.700 align:middle line:90%
it'll be much worse.

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:51.030 align:middle line:84%
But it will keep going up until
eventually the big one, as I

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:53.875 align:middle line:84%
call it, happens when
the Federal Reserve can

00:44:53.875 --> 00:44:58.210 align:middle line:84%
no longer create a perception
that everything's OK.

00:44:58.210 --> 00:44:58.710 align:middle line:90%
The fact--

00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And this is all
perception at this point.

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Like I said in the
very beginning,

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:03.640 align:middle line:90%
this is infotainment.

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.937 align:middle line:90%
It's all a charade.

00:45:05.937 --> 00:45:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: They had tools.

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:09.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, again we're
talking about the 1970s.

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:11.850 align:middle line:84%
They could actually raise
interest rates back then.

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:14.194 align:middle line:84%
Because people didn't have
zillions of dollars of debt.

00:45:14.194 --> 00:45:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Now they can't
do any of that stuff.

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Because every-- first of all,
they've tried everything.

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:20.480 align:middle line:90%
Everything's failed.

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.080 align:middle line:84%
So the way I put
every day, I say

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:25.830 align:middle line:84%
the only thing they have
left is money printing,

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:28.570 align:middle line:84%
market manipulation to
create this perception,

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:31.170 align:middle line:84%
and propaganda, just telling
you things are all right.

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.360 align:middle line:84%
Now the propaganda is
not working anymore.

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:34.700 align:middle line:90%
I mean, people are out of work.

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in
Greece, I mean, they're

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:38.280 align:middle line:90%
voting Nazis into office.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.340 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't work to
try to pretend things are OK.

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
market manipulation

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:46.920 align:middle line:84%
is becoming so obvious
that it's starting

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:48.600 align:middle line:84%
to become mainstream
in many ways.

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm highlighting
this constantly.

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:53.370 align:middle line:84%
How many mainstream
outlets are starting

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:55.570 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the
plunge protection team.

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And to realize that quantitative
easing is manipulation.

00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:03.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the government bought
60% of all the treasury bonds

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:04.560 align:middle line:90%
last year.

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And they try to act like on,
still on CNBC, bonds are up.

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you
keep buying them.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:11.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: When they're
telling you who's buying them.

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:14.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:18.740 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now, a lot of times when
you get into this conversation,

00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:21.400 align:middle line:84%
we start getting
into an ego mode.

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:25.280 align:middle line:84%
You know, the United States
is losing it superpower status

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:26.020 align:middle line:90%
economically.

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:27.417 align:middle line:84%
And China's moving
into the lead.

00:46:27.417 --> 00:46:29.750 align:middle line:84%
But let's look at what's
really happening to the Chinese

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:30.390 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:33.300 align:middle line:84%
This is not a pat
picture at all.

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.930 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: No,
again the Chinese,

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:38.780 align:middle line:84%
for whatever they take, they've
gotta feed five extra people.

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:40.660 align:middle line:90%
They're five to one population.

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:44.530 align:middle line:84%
So they have create-- they
have gained all of the market

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:47.530 align:middle line:84%
share of manufacturing, which
would have happened anyway.

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:49.970 align:middle line:90%
I mean, more people need jobs.

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:51.450 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
lower the wages.

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And the United
States promoted that.

00:46:53.650 --> 00:46:55.970 align:middle line:84%
All these same corporations
and Wall Street people

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:57.660 align:middle line:84%
that got rid of
Glass Steagall also

00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:59.980 align:middle line:84%
lobbied for all the
international trade agreements

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:03.100 align:middle line:84%
like NAFTA and Gada, and
all those things that

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:07.530 align:middle line:84%
allowed the nations to
outsource to other nations--

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:09.660 align:middle line:84%
the corporations to
outsource to other nations.

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Now people say, oh,
these evil corporations.

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:14.880 align:middle line:84%
GE, oh, they're sending
the-- no, corporations,

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.150 align:middle line:90%
their job is to make profits.

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:17.816 align:middle line:84%
I would do the same
thing if you allowed

00:47:17.816 --> 00:47:20.680 align:middle line:84%
me to have things made
in China by people

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:21.970 align:middle line:90%
making a tenth of the cost.

00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:24.197 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
just good business.

00:47:24.197 --> 00:47:26.530 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese government, because
they had so many people,

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:30.190 align:middle line:84%
realized, well, we better let
the capitalists come in here.

00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:31.670 align:middle line:90%
Because we need jobs.

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And the fact is, they're
never going to go back.

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Because forget even the
union stuff over here,

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:39.150 align:middle line:84%
the fact is the
prices will always

00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:41.046 align:middle line:90%
be lower for wages over there.

00:47:41.046 --> 00:47:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And they're harder
working because they

00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:44.580 align:middle line:84%
don't have insurance
or a safety net.

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:46.630 align:middle line:90%
They need to work.

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:48.590 align:middle line:90%
And so that was part of it.

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:49.790 align:middle line:90%
We helped to create that.

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:51.270 align:middle line:90%
It would have happened anyway.

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:52.640 align:middle line:90%
And the fact is OK, great.

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.520 align:middle line:84%
All of the market share of
manufacturing is in China.

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.560 align:middle line:90%
But look how they're doing.

00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Part of the reason they were
able to keep the costs so low

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:04.780 align:middle line:84%
was by pegging the Chinese
yuan to the dollar,

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:06.080 align:middle line:90%
which people don't realize--

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that changed,
that shifted last week.

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Didn't they decide
to allow it to--

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: A little bit.

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Little?

00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:13.186 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: I mean, they've
been allowing for the last five

00:48:13.186 --> 00:48:16.622 align:middle line:84%
or 10 years it to inch
higher, but nothing like what

00:48:16.622 --> 00:48:18.080 align:middle line:84%
it would be if they
just let it go.

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:20.130 align:middle line:84%
It would just explode
against the dollar.

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And there would be
major ramifications,

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:23.840 align:middle line:90%
negative either way.

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.610 align:middle line:84%
They keep it where
it is, it's bad.

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:27.290 align:middle line:84%
If they let it go
the other way, we'd

00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:29.080 align:middle line:84%
have hyperinflation here
immediately, because, you know.

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:29.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: So the fact
is, the Chinese created

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:33.880 align:middle line:90%
an artificial environment.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Our corporations,
and politicians,

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.420 align:middle line:84%
and bankers foster
that environment,

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:40.710 align:middle line:84%
which during good times
seemed like a good thing.

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:44.560 align:middle line:84%
It also-- it created speculation
in China with all the

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:48.260 align:middle line:84%
newfound riches, which caused a
stock bubble and a real estate

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:50.195 align:middle line:84%
bubble, which are all
crashing right now.

00:48:50.195 --> 00:48:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
people are realizing now

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:54.370 align:middle line:84%
that the rest the world,
including their big customer,

00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:56.450 align:middle line:84%
the United States, are
not spending anymore,

00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:58.410 align:middle line:84%
that they're in a
major recession.

00:48:58.410 --> 00:49:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So they're seeing a drop
in industrial demand,

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:04.029 align:middle line:90%
in manufacturing output.

00:49:04.029 --> 00:49:06.320 align:middle line:84%
They're seeing a bursting of
their stock in real estate

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:07.370 align:middle line:90%
bubbles.

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's just
a communist government

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:12.000 align:middle line:84%
run by a couple
of dozen jerks who

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.109 align:middle line:90%
know nothing about economics.

00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:17.650 align:middle line:84%
So there-- I mean, I'd rather
be here than there are any day,

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:21.150 align:middle line:84%
because they're going to have
a lot, a lot of unhappy people

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:22.600 align:middle line:90%
that are going to be starving.

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
you know, we hear about

00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:28.110 align:middle line:84%
and we see the pictures of
these strange condominium

00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:30.314 align:middle line:84%
developments that are empty
because it hasn't really

00:49:30.314 --> 00:49:30.980 align:middle line:90%
been brought up.

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Ghost cities.

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:33.089 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Ghost
cities and the like.

00:49:33.089 --> 00:49:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, in reality,
the last stat I

00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:37.660 align:middle line:84%
read was something like
a third of the people

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:40.500 align:middle line:84%
are still living without
electricity, without plumbing,

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:42.010 align:middle line:90%
and without kitchens.

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Just ordinarily, it's not
as though the standard

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:49.060 align:middle line:84%
of life across the
board has been raised.

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:50.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, for some perhaps, but--

00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:51.918 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: That's
absolutely right.

00:49:51.918 --> 00:49:53.294 align:middle line:90%
It was in the cities.

00:49:53.294 --> 00:49:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: The big cities
got all the wealth.

00:49:55.850 --> 00:49:58.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not unlike
what's happened here,

00:49:58.070 --> 00:50:01.470 align:middle line:84%
where the banks, and
the defense contractors,

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:03.890 align:middle line:84%
and a few the big
corporations had

00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:06.280 align:middle line:84%
huge, huge growth in the
last couple of decades,

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:08.250 align:middle line:90%
but not the average company.

00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:09.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in China
again, it's also

00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:12.710 align:middle line:84%
it's a tiered society,
where a lot of money

00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:15.470 align:middle line:84%
went to a small
amount of people.

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:17.900 align:middle line:84%
The government,
because of the boom,

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:22.280 align:middle line:84%
had enough revenue to kind
of do their socialist thing.

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:24.870 align:middle line:84%
But that's a problem
with socialism.

00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:27.520 align:middle line:84%
When you don't have money,
you can't pay for everyone.

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yet at
the same time, I've

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:31.030 align:middle line:84%
also read that they've
been stockpiling

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:34.670 align:middle line:84%
huge amounts of
currencies and also

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:38.540 align:middle line:84%
very large amounts of gold,
warehouses of the stuff.

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.670 align:middle line:90%
So how does that play in?

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:43.469 align:middle line:84%
They're obviously attempting to
make their future more secure.

00:50:43.469 --> 00:50:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well,
that's the one thing

00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:48.050 align:middle line:84%
they do have that's because
they've been selling so

00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:50.590 align:middle line:84%
many things to the
United States and Europe,

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:53.840 align:middle line:84%
they have built trillions and
trillions of currency reserves.

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:56.060 align:middle line:84%
I think it's over
$3 trillion now.

00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:58.800 align:middle line:84%
They also know that
those dollars and euros

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:01.050 align:middle line:84%
are depreciating
because of inflation.

00:51:01.050 --> 00:51:04.460 align:middle line:84%
So not only do they have all
this depreciating currency

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:07.486 align:middle line:84%
coming in, but they fear
for what they already have.

00:51:07.486 --> 00:51:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So they have been, I
mean, buying everything.

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They're buying
gold, right, gold like crazy.

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Everything.

00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:12.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Every commodity.

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Everything.

00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:14.030 align:middle line:90%
They are buying gold.

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.760 align:middle line:90%
They are buying--

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:15.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But that's smart.

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Of course.

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's smart.

00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:18.471 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: They know that the
dollar's going to be worthless.

00:51:18.471 --> 00:51:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And they also know that he who
has the gold makes the rules.

00:51:22.050 --> 00:51:25.220 align:middle line:84%
When this all breaks apart,
the currencies, which

00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:28.720 align:middle line:84%
could be this year, next year,
I mean two years, who knows,

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.170 align:middle line:84%
whoever has the gold
is going to be rich

00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:33.240 align:middle line:84%
because there'll
be a new standard,

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:36.270 align:middle line:84%
a new kind of currency
standard based on real money.

00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:38.869 align:middle line:84%
People will look into Fort Knox,
thinking the United States is

00:51:38.869 --> 00:51:40.660 align:middle line:84%
going to be rich and
realize it's all gone.

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:41.580 align:middle line:90%
It's been leased out.

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:42.600 align:middle line:90%
It's been sold.

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:45.750 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese, the
Russians, the Arabs,

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:48.430 align:middle line:84%
basically anyone who's
had an inflow of income

00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:50.630 align:middle line:84%
has been buying them,
the gold and silver.

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And they are the ones
who are going to be rich.

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:53.990 align:middle line:84%
So the Chinese, not only
have they been buying it

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:55.531 align:middle line:84%
for themselves, but
for years they've

00:51:55.531 --> 00:51:58.790 align:middle line:84%
been promoting, actively
promoting, for the public

00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:59.690 align:middle line:90%
to be buying it.

00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:01.506 align:middle line:84%
Because they want the
public to have gold,

00:52:01.506 --> 00:52:02.630 align:middle line:90%
too, so everyone's wealthy.

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Heck, they might
confiscated it from them,

00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:06.490 align:middle line:84%
but they want to make
sure that it's in China.

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:07.430 align:middle line:90%
Whereas in here--

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:08.304 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's smart.

00:52:08.304 --> 00:52:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: The only promotion
we get is cash for gold.

00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:14.001 align:middle line:84%
Sell us your gold at
10 cents on the dollar.

00:52:14.001 --> 00:52:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Whereas there, they
tell them to buy gold.

00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:19.350 align:middle line:84%
Because they want the
nation to get wealthier.

00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
at least somebody

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:23.002 align:middle line:84%
on the planet's
thinking long term.

00:52:23.002 --> 00:52:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: They definitely
got that part right.

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:26.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Exactly,
which we don't.

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:28.010 align:middle line:90%
We're not known for that.

00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:29.750 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to ask you.

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:31.350 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a trick
question, but I

00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:33.190 align:middle line:84%
just-- we only have
a few minutes left.

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And I probably shouldn't
use our time this way.

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:38.460 align:middle line:84%
But I've never
understood derivatives.

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
watching the film,

00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:42.940 align:middle line:84%
"Inside Job," where
the question was posed,

00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.100 align:middle line:84%
could you please explain
derivatives to someone--

00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:47.980 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember the name
the person-- very high up.

00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:49.480 align:middle line:90%
And they couldn't.

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:50.160 align:middle line:90%
They stumbled.

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And finally everyone
was giggling.

00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And that was the end
of the conversation.

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:56.326 align:middle line:84%
So can you explain
what a derivative is?

00:52:56.326 --> 00:52:56.950 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:58.450 align:middle line:84%
In the simplest
form, a derivative

00:52:58.450 --> 00:53:01.260 align:middle line:84%
just means a security that
derives its value based

00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:03.214 align:middle line:84%
on the movement of
another security.

00:53:03.214 --> 00:53:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's
that really mean?

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:06.379 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: Well, I
wrote a piece last year

00:53:06.379 --> 00:53:07.870 align:middle line:84%
called "The
Single-Celled Option,"

00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:10.720 align:middle line:84%
trying to say how like
you have one cell.

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.650 align:middle line:90%
And then it splits.

00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:12.247 align:middle line:90%
And it splits.

00:53:12.247 --> 00:53:12.830 align:middle line:90%
And it splits.

00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:14.610 align:middle line:90%
And it becomes a whole organism.

00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:18.980 align:middle line:84%
When they created stock
options back in early '70s,

00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:22.380 align:middle line:84%
it was like OK,
you buy something.

00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:25.270 align:middle line:84%
You pay a premium,
maybe a dollar or two,

00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:29.730 align:middle line:84%
so that if a stock is
above $20 in the future,

00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:31.450 align:middle line:90%
you can get the difference.

00:53:31.450 --> 00:53:35.790 align:middle line:84%
If it's 25 and you have a
$20 call option, you make $5.

00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:37.260 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:41.120 align:middle line:84%
So that proliferated,
because people realized

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:45.540 align:middle line:84%
they can control more capital
with a smaller investment.

00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:48.810 align:middle line:84%
The problem with the option,
though, is that it expires.

00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And most of them
expire worthless.

00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:52.482 align:middle line:90%
So yes, you can make more money.

00:53:52.482 --> 00:53:53.690 align:middle line:90%
But you're probably instead--

00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It can expire
at a bad time, too.

00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:55.810 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The timing can be off.

00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:57.366 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah.

00:53:57.366 --> 00:53:59.450 align:middle line:84%
You don't know
when it-- the point

00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:01.310 align:middle line:84%
is, most people lose
money in options.

00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:03.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a loser's game, OK.

00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:06.520 align:middle line:84%
But people loved it because
Americans love leverage.

00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:08.400 align:middle line:90%
And Britons love leverage.

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Everyone loves leverage
until, of course, they lose.

00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And when the banks
took over the system,

00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:15.130 align:middle line:84%
as I'm talking about in
the '80s and the '90s,

00:54:15.130 --> 00:54:20.260 align:middle line:84%
they created much more complex
derivatives, there's futures,

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:24.800 align:middle line:84%
there's options, there's
collateral mortgage,

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:28.050 align:middle line:84%
what do you call them, CMOs,
Collateral Mortgage Obligations

00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:29.650 align:middle line:84%
where they package
up real estate

00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:31.080 align:middle line:90%
and split it into pieces.

00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:32.340 align:middle line:84%
You can buy the interest
only, the property--

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've got
to say, you know

00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:35.720 align:middle line:84%
what, it's still kind of
sounding like Greek to me.

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.885 align:middle line:84%
And we only have about a
minute left to wrap that up.

00:54:37.885 --> 00:54:39.343 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: And my
point is, they've

00:54:39.343 --> 00:54:43.090 align:middle line:84%
created these complex,
intertwined options, where

00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:44.180 align:middle line:90%
it's a zero sum game.

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:47.070 align:middle line:84%
Because if one person
loses, the other person

00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:48.290 align:middle line:90%
won't have money to pay them.

00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:49.050 align:middle line:90%
So everyone loses.

00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:49.865 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Everybody loses.

00:54:49.865 --> 00:54:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yes.

00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, well
that sounds like that's

00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:54.190 align:middle line:84%
been the story of derivatives
from the headline news anyway.

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So just to give us an
idea, and you've already

00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:59.190 align:middle line:84%
made various references
to it along the way,

00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:01.650 align:middle line:84%
but just give us a one,
two, three, four, five,

00:55:01.650 --> 00:55:03.150 align:middle line:84%
we only have a
minute or so left,

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:05.959 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what
we can do now which

00:55:05.959 --> 00:55:08.250 align:middle line:84%
might be a little late in
the game for a lot of people,

00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:09.980 align:middle line:84%
if you haven't already
considered what's coming up.

00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>HOFFMAN: If you still have
a net worth left, a liquid net

00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:16.110 align:middle line:84%
worth, I recommend putting
as much of it as possible

00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:19.070 align:middle line:84%
into physical gold and silver,
and even a little of what

00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:21.990 align:middle line:84%
they call junk silver, which is
the old dimes, because they're

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:23.580 align:middle line:90%
a very small denomination.

00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 90% silver.

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:25.521 align:middle line:90%
>>HOFFMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:55:25.521 --> 00:55:27.610 align:middle line:84%
That's a great way to
restore your wealth.

00:55:27.610 --> 00:55:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And also, just think about
the worst case scenario.

00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Forget about investment,
stocks, bonds, those things.

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Think what happens if
inflation gets really bad?

00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And that means protect
yourself with getting out

00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:41.280 align:middle line:84%
of debt for one
thing, making sure

00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:44.560 align:middle line:84%
that you have stocks of food
and other life necessities,

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:47.120 align:middle line:84%
and of course, I can't
emphasize enough, physical gold

00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:48.830 align:middle line:90%
and silver.

00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I'm with you on that.

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:52.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been following
the same strategy, and which

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:54.810 align:middle line:84%
is why I think I appreciate
your work so much,

00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:56.970 align:middle line:84%
is because from a
conservative position,

00:55:56.970 --> 00:56:00.820 align:middle line:84%
we were told back in 19--
no, back in 2006 what

00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:04.090 align:middle line:84%
would be coming down in 2008,
which everything came right

00:56:04.090 --> 00:56:05.284 align:middle line:90%
on schedule.

00:56:05.284 --> 00:56:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And so we've been thinking
about it for quite a long time.

00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:10.140 align:middle line:84%
So I'm hoping that
this has helped

00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:13.610 align:middle line:84%
you unravel some of the mystery
about the financial world a bit

00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:15.150 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:17.680 align:middle line:10%
Even more so, I'm
hoping this conversation

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:20.610 align:middle line:10%
is giving you a little better
of an understanding of how

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:23.472 align:middle line:10%
to take care of
you and your family

00:56:23.472 --> 00:56:25.180 align:middle line:10%
as the times go on,
because I don't think

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:26.360 align:middle line:10%
it's going to get a lot easier.

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:27.430 align:middle line:10%
It may get a lot worse.

00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:30.410 align:middle line:10%
And meanwhile, there
are other types

00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:32.660 align:middle line:10%
of currencies that have been
used throughout history,

00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:34.890 align:middle line:10%
one of them is known as
complimentary currencies,

00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:38.180 align:middle line:10%
to help stem some of the
problems in times like this.

00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:40.320 align:middle line:10%
And along that line, you
might enjoy my interview

00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:43.190 align:middle line:10%
with Stephen Belgin, if you
have not already watched it.

00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:46.800 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thanks for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
