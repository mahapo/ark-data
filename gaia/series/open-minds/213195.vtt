00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.030 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: The flag
I've been waving for decades is

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.790 align:middle line:10%
that once we can consciously
connect with our higher self,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:21.990 align:middle line:10%
the game changes.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.740 align:middle line:84%
We know our purpose, our past,
and what we need to do now.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Toward that end,
Dr. Linda Backman

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.490 align:middle line:84%
has been teaching her
students the nature

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.820 align:middle line:84%
of the soul and the differences
among the souls here on Earth.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.130 align:middle line:90%
And we are wildly different.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.150 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Linda.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.810 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful to
sit with you again.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>> LINDA BACKMAN:
Thank you, Regina.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.060 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be back.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So I thought what
we'd do is for people who

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.490 align:middle line:84%
didn't see our previous
show-- and I recommend they do

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.157 align:middle line:84%
because we'll do some
other things too--

00:00:46.157 --> 00:00:50.100 align:middle line:84%
but go over a few things
like the nature of the soul.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.738 align:middle line:84%
And you call the soul
the higher self, right?

00:00:53.738 --> 00:00:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: I mean, that's an
important-- can we start there?

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's start there
because the vernacular for what

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.990 align:middle line:84%
soul, spirit, and
higher self is,

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.810 align:middle line:84%
is different from tradition to
tradition and person to person.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.970 align:middle line:84%
So give us, so we know
what you're talking about,

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:07.770 align:middle line:90%
your definition.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.880 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: OK, good.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.980 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful for clarity.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.550 align:middle line:10%
OK, so when we're in body--
you, me, people listening--

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.390 align:middle line:10%
when we're in body, we have
a portion of our soul energy

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.330 align:middle line:10%
in our body that causes
us to live and breathe.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.240 align:middle line:10%
Our higher self is the
remainder of our soul

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.020 align:middle line:10%
that exists somewhere in
the spiritual realm that

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.940 align:middle line:10%
is not in our body.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And we have to have a
higher self because that's

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.570 align:middle line:90%
part of our guidance system.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.370 align:middle line:84%
So higher self and soul
and body are related,

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.630 align:middle line:84%
but they're, we might say, two
different aspects of our soul.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, and
because of my background,

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.690 align:middle line:84%
I tend to come from the language
of hermetics although embrace

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.900 align:middle line:84%
many, many different
philosophies and traditions.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.780 align:middle line:90%
The language there would pair--

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.700 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like
a pairing complex

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.960 align:middle line:84%
of that infinite spark
of soul and the higher

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.730 align:middle line:90%
mind as a complex.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.030 align:middle line:10%
But the higher mind can
be accessed and translated

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:10%
to the lower mind, to
our conscious mind.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.720 align:middle line:90%
So I'm coming from that place.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.240 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm talking
to you, that's

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.530 align:middle line:90%
what I'm seeing in my mind.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is that
most people are not

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.750 align:middle line:84%
connecting consciously
with the higher mind, which

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.320 align:middle line:90%
is here to do the guiding.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: I could have said
the exact same words to you.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.350 align:middle line:84%
That is part of the
issue for a lot of people

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.350 align:middle line:84%
is they're not connecting
to their soul energy

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.120 align:middle line:90%
in the higher realm.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And that way, they
know who they are.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.070 align:middle line:84%
They receive their
guidance, but they

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.380 align:middle line:84%
don't think about
connecting to what

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.880 align:middle line:84%
you might be calling
the higher mind

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and I would call
the higher self.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, same thing.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.210 align:middle line:90%
So the higher self--

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.430 align:middle line:84%
you and I have the
same perception

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.640 align:middle line:84%
that the higher self is probably
our most profound guidance.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.700 align:middle line:84%
But at times, we can't
access it so we need

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.290 align:middle line:90%
help from some other friends.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
this a little bit?

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: Yes, so let's put
that if we can in the context

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.490 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual guides.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.220 align:middle line:84%
So here's what I know from
years of guiding regression

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.250 align:middle line:90%
about spiritual guides.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And I know we'll talk about
the different types of souls.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you are a soul that
primarily incarnates on Earth,

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.800 align:middle line:84%
then your higher
self is a guide.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, you have
a separate experienced guide

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:90%
that is not your higher self.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.290 align:middle line:84%
If you're an
interplanetary soul,

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.720 align:middle line:84%
meaning you come from
somewhere else in the universe

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:84%
and you don't come
here often, then

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.030 align:middle line:84%
your higher self, not always but
often, is your primary guide.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And I also know we'll
talk about angelic souls.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.190 align:middle line:84%
If you're a soul from
the angelic realm,

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.150 align:middle line:84%
usually, your higher
self is your main guide.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So tell us what
the unique challenge is

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking
percentages here.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Most of the people on Earth
are Earth-based souls, you say.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.750 align:middle line:84%
They've incarnated many times,
and they know the energetic.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And they know the drill of
what it means to be human,

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:84%
the physicality, the
energies of the Earth,

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.720 align:middle line:84%
the resistance,
beauty, et cetera.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.110 align:middle line:84%
You say that you are a
very, very well-experienced

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.490 align:middle line:90%
Earth-based soul.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Right.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.160 align:middle line:84%
So I'll put it in percentages
to try to ground it.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.590 align:middle line:84%
About 95% of humans
are Earth-based souls,

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.400 align:middle line:84%
meaning their soul was designed
to grow and evolve on Earth.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.820 align:middle line:90%
And about 95% of humans are--

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.690 align:middle line:84%
if we put soul evolution
on a 10-point scale,

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.340 align:middle line:84%
95% of humans are probably
between a 4 and 6.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What's that mean?

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: That means that
they're-- think about it like

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Earth-based souls come into
body on Earth to grow and learn.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So 95% of humans are souls
designed to come primarily

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.970 align:middle line:84%
to Earth, and they are midrange
of development in terms

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.813 align:middle line:90%
of soul wisdom or--

00:05:11.813 --> 00:05:12.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Soul development.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:13.813 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, so
around midland, 4 to 6--

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.325 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:05:16.325 --> 00:05:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --yeah, on the scale.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.140 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: Then if we take that
other 5% that we're not talking

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.500 align:middle line:84%
about-- so that
other 5% of humans,

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.640 align:middle line:84%
about half are advanced
Earth-based souls,

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.020 align:middle line:84%
souls that are 7s, 8s, and 9s on
a 10-point scale of evolution.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:90%
And then take the other--

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.750 align:middle line:84%
I hope this isn't
confusing for people.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Take the other 2 and 1/2%, and
we have to split that into two.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Half of that 2 and 1/2%
or so are interplanetary,

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.600 align:middle line:90%
and the other half are angelic.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Those souls,
interplanetary and angelic,

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.300 align:middle line:90%
are all highly advanced.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why they come to
Earth to help us, basically.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.827 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
they're on a mission.

00:05:58.827 --> 00:05:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Correct.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.952 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so they usually
have their own guidance.

00:06:01.952 --> 00:06:05.480 align:middle line:84%
They're clear on what they're
here to do and oftentimes

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.230 align:middle line:84%
find that path earlier in life
than an Earth-based soul that's

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.930 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure it out and
not getting clear communication

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.437 align:middle line:90%
with their higher mind.

00:06:13.437 --> 00:06:14.270 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Correct.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And often struggle more
than Earth-based souls

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.582 align:middle line:90%
do in body on Earth.

00:06:19.582 --> 00:06:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Being in a body in
particular is very difficult.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Correct.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.500 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So let's talk about--

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.650 align:middle line:84%
well, OK, so as an
Earth-based soul, which

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.220 align:middle line:84%
is the average person that's
going to be walking around

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.830 align:middle line:84%
on Earth between a
4 and 6, and they're

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:84%
trying to gain access to their
guidance, what's blocking them

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.690 align:middle line:84%
from going directly
to the higher mind

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and rather having to talk
directly with a guide?

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.620 align:middle line:84%
What's the benefit of each
aspect in development?

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:57.380 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: Well, one thing
that's blocking so many humans,

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.710 align:middle line:84%
as I was blocked until
I was well into my 40s,

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.590 align:middle line:84%
one thing that's blocking them
is they don't understand how

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.757 align:middle line:84%
to access intuition, or they
don't trust their intuition.

00:07:06.757 --> 00:07:08.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and society
makes sure you don't.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: That's right.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So to be fair, we've
got a lot working against us

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.047 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:07:13.047 --> 00:07:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Correct.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.680 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.270 align:middle line:84%
We're not taught,
what is intuition?

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.080 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.440 align:middle line:90%
We think we're making it up.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.810 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.150 align:middle line:90%
But for an Earth-based soul--

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and obviously, I'm an example
of an Earth-based soul.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.280 align:middle line:84%
For an Earth-based
soul, we communicate

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.350 align:middle line:84%
with both, both a lead guide
that's not our higher self

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.510 align:middle line:90%
and with our higher self.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And so we almost have
not more guidance

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.170 align:middle line:84%
than an interplanetary
soul or an angelic,

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:46.420 align:middle line:84%
but we have almost two
avenues, two connections.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.340 align:middle line:90%
I often talk to my higher self.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.980 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to just call it her.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.460 align:middle line:90%
Does my higher self have gender?

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.260 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.270 align:middle line:90%
But her is just easier.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.185 align:middle line:84%
And I talk to my main guide
that is not my higher self.

00:07:59.185 --> 00:08:01.810 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So I'm going to guess
from your mission in life that

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:10%
you're among the percent that
are advanced Earth-based souls.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.290 align:middle line:90%
You've been around a long time.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.890 align:middle line:84%
You've really been
working on it.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And so each of
those aspects, does

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.790 align:middle line:84%
one come in handy more than
the other, an outside guide

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:90%
versus higher self?

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.182 align:middle line:84%
Are there distinctions
between how you use them?

00:08:16.182 --> 00:08:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: Regina, that's
an awesome question.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.490 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:23.740 align:middle line:90%
Let me see how to answer that.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.240 align:middle line:90%
That's hard.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.850 align:middle line:84%
When I talk to my
higher self, it's

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:32.409 align:middle line:84%
almost like I'm talking
to my big sister.

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't literally have a
big sister in current life,

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.530 align:middle line:84%
but it's almost like I'm
talking to my big sis.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.270 align:middle line:90%
I respect her.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.900 align:middle line:90%
But she's also me, part of me.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.030 align:middle line:84%
When I talk to my
main guide, who I

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.860 align:middle line:90%
know at this stage of my life.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm very familiar
with my main guide

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.700 align:middle line:84%
as a very advanced-- we might
call an ascended master.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a little bit
more of a mentor feel.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a little bit more
of a senior professor

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.210 align:middle line:84%
but not in a dogmatic,
critical way.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:09.490 align:middle line:84%
So I actually go to each of
them with different types

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:10.600 align:middle line:90%
of questions.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, yeah,
well, that's good.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:15.450 align:middle line:84%
For anyone listening who
are also in the same boat,

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.950 align:middle line:84%
I just want to give a little
practical information up front.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, you say
there are three components

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.370 align:middle line:90%
of the way our minds work.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is the
past, which of course,

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.570 align:middle line:84%
is the subconscious,
where everything

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.280 align:middle line:90%
is embodied, essentially.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.690 align:middle line:90%
It's all remembered.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:33.110 align:middle line:84%
We carry that forward
with us, those memories,

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.620 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious memories to
help us contend with Earth life.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.270 align:middle line:84%
We've got a template
in there for when

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.830 align:middle line:90%
this happens, step that way.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.677 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that part of our mind.

00:09:44.677 --> 00:09:46.385 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: So what
we're talking about--

00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:50.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously, I understand
the brain to a degree because

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.820 align:middle line:90%
of my background in psychology.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.150 align:middle line:84%
I think of the
subconscious as, what's

00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:01.010 align:middle line:84%
that content of information
that's held in my human brain

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:08.270 align:middle line:84%
that if I relax or if I
have a dream or I daydream,

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:09.620 align:middle line:90%
I can track?

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, what was the name of
my second grade teacher?

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.995 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah her name was so and so.

00:10:13.995 --> 00:10:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's going to be
over there in that library.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:17.412 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: That's right.

00:10:17.412 --> 00:10:21.530 align:middle line:10%
And that's the library in
my human brain as opposed

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.430 align:middle line:10%
to the library at my soul level.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:25.070 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Because the library of the
soul level continues with us,

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:29.810 align:middle line:90%
does it not?

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.420 align:middle line:84%
So we can continue
growing from that base

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.950 align:middle line:90%
and learning from that base.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Right.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And the library
at the soul level

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.060 align:middle line:90%
is held with our higher self.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.540 align:middle line:10%
But also, our main guide, if
we have a separate main guide,

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.430 align:middle line:10%
they also have access
to our library.

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:45.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.130 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.800 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that we weren't

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.230 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about
but I'd like to is,

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:55.010 align:middle line:84%
first, we'll get into the nature
of these different three soul

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:59.270 align:middle line:84%
types and the notion that
Earth-based souls in particular

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.760 align:middle line:84%
have the ability,
as far as you're

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.520 align:middle line:84%
able to see in all these
regressions, to split

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:09.620 align:middle line:84%
into different incarnations
simultaneously,

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.970 align:middle line:90%
which is interesting.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.760 align:middle line:84%
Some systems say
that's not possible.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.142 align:middle line:90%
Others say it is possible.

00:11:17.142 --> 00:11:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk
about evidence for that.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.720 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, tell us about
the nature of Earth-based souls

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.725 align:middle line:90%
a little bit.

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:24.830 align:middle line:90%
You talked about it a bit.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And the nature of
interplanetary souls and largely

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.430 align:middle line:84%
what they're tasked
with and angelic.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:35.680 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: OK, well, the nature
of Earth-based souls is that

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.370 align:middle line:84%
we've just been here over
and over most of the time.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not over and
over quite as much

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.610 align:middle line:84%
as I have or other
experienced Earth-based souls

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.620 align:middle line:90%
but still Earth-based souls.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:54.520 align:middle line:10%
It's like if I need to drive
from Denver to Colorado Springs,

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.820 align:middle line:10%
I don't need a map, because
I have a lot of experience

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:01.270 align:middle line:10%
in a particular state.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:03.118 align:middle line:84%
Earth-based souls sort
of know the ropes.

00:12:03.118 --> 00:12:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So they're a little
physically, emotionally,

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.553 align:middle line:84%
generally more
comfortable, you're saying?

00:12:07.553 --> 00:12:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Generally.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.760 align:middle line:84%
But the more advanced
and Earth-based soul

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.600 align:middle line:84%
is, then they begin to be
very affected by energy, very

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.950 align:middle line:84%
affected by intuition that
might get in the way at times

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:20.240 align:middle line:90%
but is purposeful.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.390 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, they're
experienced just being in body,

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:27.320 align:middle line:84%
in these human bodies that
are unique over and over

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.160 align:middle line:90%
and over and over again.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so then
we go to the IP souls,

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.410 align:middle line:90%
which are interplanetary.

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.780 align:middle line:90%
They can be from other planets.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Can they also be from
other dimensions?

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: So that depends on
what people mean by dimensions.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe the
easiest way to put

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.060 align:middle line:84%
it is that interplanetary
souls on Earth

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.820 align:middle line:84%
almost always come
from somewhere

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:54.260 align:middle line:84%
inside of the solar system
that contains Earth.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And we often call
that the solar system,

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.410 align:middle line:84%
but it's the solar system
because we're living on Earth.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And so interplanetary souls
come from planets, star systems,

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.773 align:middle line:84%
but they also come from
nondense locations like--

00:13:09.773 --> 00:13:11.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what I'm asking.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.607 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: --you're
referring to.

00:13:12.607 --> 00:13:15.800 align:middle line:84%
They don't always come from
something that has density.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.680 align:middle line:90%
They can come from spacecraft.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.700 align:middle line:84%
They don't always have to be
from Sirius or the Pleiades.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.710 align:middle line:84%
They come from places where
the names mean nothing to us.

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:27.310 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And so people are perked up and
listening to this and thinking,

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:34.490 align:middle line:84%
well, I don't feel
comfortable on Earth.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.110 align:middle line:84%
How might they
identify themselves

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:39.380 align:middle line:90%
if they were an IP soul?

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Various ways.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:43.760 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite ways, because
I hear this a lot from clients,

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.030 align:middle line:84%
is that it's the person who
says to me something like this.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:52.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, Linda, even
as a young child,

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.740 align:middle line:84%
I was fascinated
with the night sky.

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Even as a five-year-old,
I would stand

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.870 align:middle line:84%
by the window in the evening
and stare out the window.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And my parents would say, Suzy,
Johnny, whatever, come away

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:04.610 align:middle line:90%
from the window.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:09.200 align:middle line:84%
But no, I was fascinated
with what goes on

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.110 align:middle line:90%
out there in the dark sky.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:16.200 align:middle line:84%
As an Earth-based soul, I
wasn't fascinated with that.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.790 align:middle line:84%
So usually,
something sci-fi-ish,

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:23.360 align:middle line:84%
astrologically related
they're fascinated with.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.560 align:middle line:84%
The other common identifying
feature is health,

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:33.500 align:middle line:84%
is allergies, digestive
disorders, sleep issues,

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:84%
autoimmune disorders,
the autistic spectrum,

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:41.690 align:middle line:84%
those people who
struggle in such ways,

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:45.560 align:middle line:84%
sometimes to extremes,
not always to extremes.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.260 align:middle line:84%
That's often a sign of
an interplanetary soul.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:52.093 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, one very,
very, very hotly debated

00:14:52.093 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:84%
and well-known one that
immediately comes to mind is

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.340 align:middle line:90%
Elon Musk.

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.823 align:middle line:84%
He cannot be an
Earth-based soul.

00:14:57.823 --> 00:14:59.240 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: I don't
know for sure.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.077 align:middle line:84%
But I would suspect you're
completely accurate.

00:15:02.077 --> 00:15:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Especially with
his drive to take human

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.380 align:middle line:84%
consciousness to Mars
since he was a kid.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.620 align:middle line:90%
We got to get to Mars.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.570 align:middle line:90%
We got to get to Mars.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And being on the spectrum
at the same time,

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.950 align:middle line:84%
saying inappropriate things
because he doesn't have filters.

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of an
interesting extreme version,

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:21.245 align:middle line:84%
I think, of what's
likely a planetary soul.

00:15:21.245 --> 00:15:23.810 align:middle line:84%
He has a lot of digestive
issues, too, I hear.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.520 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: Yes, and
also think about--

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.200 align:middle line:84%
and I don't necessarily want
to name names even of public

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.000 align:middle line:90%
figures.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.970 align:middle line:84%
But think about famous movie
producers and directors,

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.340 align:middle line:90%
the Spielbergs of the world.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.710 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
the kind of movies

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.500 align:middle line:84%
that someone-- there are others
besides Steven Spielberg,

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:47.340 align:middle line:84%
but Spielberg tends to do, for
the most part, Earth-based type

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.140 align:middle line:90%
movies.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.140 align:middle line:84%
But you think about some of
the other famous directors

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:54.620 align:middle line:84%
and producers and writers,
where they're teaching us

00:15:54.620 --> 00:16:00.620 align:middle line:84%
about the broader perspective of
the world out there and space.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.860 align:middle line:84%
This "Soul" movie, the
Disney movie "Soul,"

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.660 align:middle line:84%
those are probably
writers, directors,

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.890 align:middle line:84%
producers that are
interplanetary souls.

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:15.150 align:middle line:84%
So as you said, hard living
in the body, it's a stretch.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.670 align:middle line:84%
So now let's go
to the other teeny

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.130 align:middle line:84%
percentage, which are
the angelic souls.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: Yes,
and you're right.

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.870 align:middle line:84%
As I said, teeny
percentage, yes.

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.600 align:middle line:84%
But spiritual people
that are probably

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.820 align:middle line:84%
interested in what
we're discussing--

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Have a high
percentage like in our audience.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: That's right.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.830 align:middle line:90%
Fit in that--

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.187 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Both IPs
and angelic souls.

00:16:36.187 --> 00:16:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Totally.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:37.820 align:middle line:90%
Totally.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.040 align:middle line:84%
So angelics is the
third type of souls

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.050 align:middle line:84%
that I began to learn
a lot about, oh, I

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:46.860 align:middle line:84%
don't know, 10, 12, 14 years
ago through my clients.

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So angelic souls
serve the divine.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.710 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about divine.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:54.930 align:middle line:84%
I want people out there
to pick their word--

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.810 align:middle line:84%
the source, great
spirit, the Tao.

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Another term I tend to
use, an Eastern term,

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:06.569 align:middle line:84%
the Manu is a highly
advanced group soul

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:12.160 align:middle line:84%
that seeks to guide Earth
and humanity forward

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.700 align:middle line:90%
in terms of evolution.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.260 align:middle line:84%
So the Manu, the source,
whatever you call it,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:21.819 align:middle line:84%
they have a cadre of
souls that support them

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:24.280 align:middle line:90%
as ambassadors, carrying--

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and human words are inadequate--
carrying love and compassion

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:32.680 align:middle line:84%
to an extreme but
bringing it to Earth.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.470 align:middle line:84%
There are angelic
souls on Earth.

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:39.500 align:middle line:84%
They struggle with the
lack of love on our planet.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And I don't just mean
everyday kind of love,

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:45.100 align:middle line:84%
love, love like
we talk about it.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.370 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:47.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: With cruelty.

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:50.080 align:middle line:84%
For example, they have
a very difficult time

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.820 align:middle line:90%
with cruelty and war.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And unkindness,
insensitivity would just

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.360 align:middle line:90%
be devastating to them.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.160 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Right.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.670 align:middle line:90%
And we need these souls.

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:04.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give a quick
example that pops into my mind

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.850 align:middle line:84%
and be cautious to
camouflage this a bit.

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:08.600 align:middle line:90%
This is a woman who's a nurse.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.180 align:middle line:90%
She's an angelic soul.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.770 align:middle line:84%
She works in a large hospital
in the United States.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:19.090 align:middle line:84%
She was the head of the
ER for a period of time.

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:22.270 align:middle line:84%
She was the charge nurse, the
main nurse in charge of the ER.

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:25.690 align:middle line:84%
And all these street people kept
being brought in, especially

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:26.630 align:middle line:90%
on weekends.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And they were acting
strange and bizarre.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And normally, when
they came into the ER,

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:38.200 align:middle line:84%
the ER docs would hit them with
heavy sedatives, major sedatives

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.310 align:middle line:90%
to knock them out.

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And finally, she said to some
of the head doctors in the ER,

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:48.010 align:middle line:84%
she said, could we start by
giving them a shower, a meal,

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:49.090 align:middle line:90%
and time to sleep?

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A cup of tea
and, yeah, some sleep.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And then let's see if
they need heavy sedatives,

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.850 align:middle line:84%
or they don't need heavy
sedatives to calm down.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, she's an angelic
soul with some nurturance.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:05.380 align:middle line:84%
These street people didn't
need heavy sedatives.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.040 align:middle line:84%
That's the way an
angelic soul would think.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's beautiful.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.820 align:middle line:10%
But then didn't the people
return to the street,

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.930 align:middle line:10%
and then it just starts
the cycle over again?

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:17.863 align:middle line:84%
So what do they do
when they've been

00:19:17.863 --> 00:19:19.780 align:middle line:84%
bumped around so much
by life that they're not

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.360 align:middle line:90%
contending very easily with it?

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.960 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: Well, we don't
assist street people in ways

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.250 align:middle line:90%
they need to be assisted.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.440 align:middle line:84%
There are programs
here in the state

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.100 align:middle line:84%
where I live where they're
building tent communities,

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.810 align:middle line:90%
where they get food.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:35.830 align:middle line:90%
They get water.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.780 align:middle line:90%
They get warmth.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.970 align:middle line:84%
We just tend to cast
those people aside

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.400 align:middle line:84%
because we decide we're
scared of them or something--

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because they're
operating outside of social

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:45.040 align:middle line:90%
norms.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: That's correct.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:46.600 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So
backtracking a little bit,

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:51.790 align:middle line:84%
so I assume that was a
regression of a woman.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:55.030 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about
something that jumps

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.520 align:middle line:84%
to mind as a fascinating
regression of an IP soul.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.160 align:middle line:90%


00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.360 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: I have so many.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:06.550 align:middle line:84%
One pops in my mind from
recently, this is a woman--

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:09.620 align:middle line:84%
again, I'm wanting to be
appropriate and confidential.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.420 align:middle line:84%
This is a woman into
her adult years.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.290 align:middle line:90%
She has a very responsible--

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to call her
a spiritual leader.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And she has always talked to
what she calls the great mother.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:27.390 align:middle line:84%
So we might quickly
think, well, we're

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:30.990 align:middle line:84%
talking about the soul of
Mother Mary or Kwan Yin.

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Or Earth.

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Or Earth.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:34.140 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, she's an IP soul
that comes from somewhere--

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.980 align:middle line:90%
I really don't know where.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And she works with what was
described with lots of detail--

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.610 align:middle line:90%
I didn't give her the details.

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:48.840 align:middle line:90%
She gave it to me--

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:54.000 align:middle line:84%
the great mother in the
universe that is, we might say,

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.120 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the
quintessential divine feminine.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Isis even
in Egyptian terms.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.390 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Correct.

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:01.320 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.120 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And that is the energy she
brings as a spiritual leader

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:90%
to help people.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.850 align:middle line:84%
At first, I thought
she was Earth based.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:11.890 align:middle line:84%
But as we went further
in her regression,

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:13.360 align:middle line:90%
she's interplanetary.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So this is the mother,
the nurturer, the deeply,

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:20.620 align:middle line:90%
deeply caring--

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:26.030 align:middle line:84%
the caregiver in the
universe that exists.

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's the energy she
brings to people she works with.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, when I
think of that energy

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.190 align:middle line:84%
and I think of the kind
of-- if you go back

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:40.720 align:middle line:84%
to the basis of
everything, if you

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.380 align:middle line:84%
go through the Egyptian lens of
Osiris and Isis, you have logos,

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.960 align:middle line:84%
and you have prima
materia, basically,

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.530 align:middle line:84%
which is we need to
learn how to work

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:55.570 align:middle line:84%
with these mediums,
these creative mediums

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.850 align:middle line:84%
on a different level
now because we're not

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:01.720 align:middle line:84%
understanding that logos
has effect on matter,

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.700 align:middle line:84%
the creation of matter,
the creation of what

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:04.880 align:middle line:90%
we see in our world.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And so what she's
doing, it sounds

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:11.380 align:middle line:84%
like she's going back to one
of the most primitive aspects

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:15.730 align:middle line:84%
of what it is to be the receiver
that ultimately manifests

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.410 align:middle line:90%
into nurturing.

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:19.090 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty powerful.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: Yes,
and I think, Regina,

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:25.690 align:middle line:84%
a piece that is really important
that I hear from clients is that

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:31.360 align:middle line:84%
the master levels of high,
evolved energy that, again,

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:35.140 align:middle line:90%
we might call source, they are--

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.100 align:middle line:84%
and I hear this-- they are
extremely worried about humanity

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:43.390 align:middle line:84%
because humanity, we have a
huge sex trafficking problem,

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:44.830 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:51.910 align:middle line:10%
Humanity is I might say not
progressing as much as source

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.080 align:middle line:10%
would wish for us to progress.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.820 align:middle line:84%
So just in relation
to what you just said,

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:01.840 align:middle line:90%
humanity is pushed harder.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And more advanced souls are
being brought closer to Earth

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:15.350 align:middle line:84%
to try to guide we as humans,
to guide us to take steps,

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:18.500 align:middle line:84%
I might say, to clean
up our human act.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And if you then
go through the Vedic lens,

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:22.910 align:middle line:84%
that validates
what you're saying.

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:24.290 align:middle line:90%
We are in the Kali Yuga.

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:26.270 align:middle line:90%
That is a difficult cycle.

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:30.290 align:middle line:84%
We're in a dark cycle
and trying to find

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.660 align:middle line:84%
our way back to
the light as we're

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.380 align:middle line:90%
emerging from that dark cycle.

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:38.480 align:middle line:84%
So we need, as Earth needs,
all the help it can get.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
really important.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.620 align:middle line:84%
If people start teaching
the mechanics of how

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:46.130 align:middle line:84%
reality works, the nature of
reality, the nature of creation,

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.380 align:middle line:84%
the nature of working
with the masculine,

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.360 align:middle line:84%
the word, the thought
form, the feminine,

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:54.620 align:middle line:84%
the reception that materializes
into this ultimate reality,

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.900 align:middle line:84%
we don't even know how
reality-- we don't even

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.600 align:middle line:90%
study how reality works.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.060 align:middle line:84%
The building blocks
of reality, they

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.850 align:middle line:84%
should start with
that in kindergarten.

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:07.100 align:middle line:90%
And IPs, well, I'm an IP, right?

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.223 align:middle line:84%
So that's the kind
of thing, of course,

00:24:09.223 --> 00:24:10.640 align:middle line:84%
I think about all
the time is, why

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.223 align:middle line:84%
aren't we teaching
the building blocks

00:24:12.223 --> 00:24:13.960 align:middle line:84%
of nature of reality
in kindergarten?

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:14.967 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:24:14.967 --> 00:24:15.800 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's the beauty
of an IP you talking

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:25.580 align:middle line:84%
to an Earth-based soul, EB me,
is that we don't study the soul.

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.750 align:middle line:84%
We don't study, where
did we come from?

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.080 align:middle line:90%
What's our purpose?

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.430 align:middle line:90%
Where is our soul?

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:32.810 align:middle line:90%
What is our soul doing?

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:35.660 align:middle line:84%
What is our higher self doing
when we're here in body?

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.780 align:middle line:90%
We don't teach that.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I know.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's critical
for us to start

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.920 align:middle line:84%
learning about the essence of
what we are, how we create,

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.010 align:middle line:84%
what our minds, what our
words, what our connection

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:47.340 align:middle line:90%
with each other does.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.640 align:middle line:84%
It's just so
elementary, and it's

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.680 align:middle line:84%
the furthest thing from any
kind of educational system.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, that's my
little axe to grind.

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:57.650 align:middle line:84%
So let's go on now back
to Earth-based souls

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.420 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of trying to
speed up this process a bit

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:01.220 align:middle line:90%
maybe.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.338 align:middle line:84%
I assume it's not for
kicks that a soul splits.

00:25:04.338 --> 00:25:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: Absolutely
not for kicks.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.463 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk about
what happens when a soul splits

00:25:08.463 --> 00:25:11.120 align:middle line:84%
and then explain the difference
between that and what we might

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.460 align:middle line:90%
call a twin soul.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.377 align:middle line:90%
Or is it one and the same?

00:25:15.377 --> 00:25:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: OK, well, some of
it depends on who you're talking

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.370 align:middle line:84%
to and what they
mean by those terms.

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:22.850 align:middle line:84%
So just to quickly
comment on twin soul,

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:27.860 align:middle line:84%
when I use the term "twin
soul," I mean if I, Linda,

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:32.780 align:middle line:84%
have a twin soul, that is
another soul with whom I've had

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.700 align:middle line:90%
many, many, many, many lives--

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so strong
resonance with a separate soul.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:38.053 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Correct.

00:25:38.053 --> 00:25:39.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK, now split soul.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:42.320 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: Split soul,
which happens primarily only

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:46.310 align:middle line:84%
for Earth-based souls but on
occasion with angelic souls--

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:47.480 align:middle line:90%
and I'll come back to that.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.380 align:middle line:84%
There's, I think, an important
piece to say about angelics.

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:55.400 align:middle line:10%
As an Earth-based soul
that is experienced,

00:25:55.400 --> 00:26:00.350 align:middle line:10%
an Earth-based soul can
split into more than one,

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:05.420 align:middle line:10%
be more than one person
simultaneously because they've

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.450 align:middle line:10%
agreed to try to help the
planet progress faster,

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.110 align:middle line:10%
farther, if you will.

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot
of public figures

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:18.410 align:middle line:84%
that are splits, that
are the same soul.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you can
recognize this by thinking

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.710 align:middle line:84%
about two people you know
in the public eye that

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:26.150 align:middle line:90%
tend to look alike.

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:29.780 align:middle line:90%
And often that is the same soul.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And for now, I'll
leave names out.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's the
cleanest way to put it.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.920 align:middle line:90%
But Earth-based souls do split.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.580 align:middle line:10%
I actually know that
I have soul splits.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:41.726 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: How many?

00:26:41.726 --> 00:26:46.610 align:middle line:84%
How many can one have at a time,
motivated by the same soul?

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: That's
a great question.

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:52.040 align:middle line:10%
A very, very advanced
Earth-based soul

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.740 align:middle line:10%
can have 25 splits.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:56.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Wow.

00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:00.680 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: Yeah, and the reason
is that an Earth-based soul

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:04.700 align:middle line:84%
that's been here many times
can energetically balance--

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:08.120 align:middle line:84%
how difficult it is from
the higher self level,

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.160 align:middle line:84%
can balance that
many incarnations.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's by way of trying
to push humanity forward.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.700 align:middle line:84%
The other piece that's
probably important for me

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.550 align:middle line:84%
to interject just so
that we talk about it,

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:23.850 align:middle line:90%
angelics can have splits.

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And this may stretch
people's minds.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:29.270 align:middle line:84%
So I want people to
think about archangels.

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:31.730 align:middle line:84%
So archangels, as
most people know,

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:34.400 align:middle line:84%
are the leaders,
the coordinators

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.450 align:middle line:84%
of the angelic realm that
work directly with source.

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Archangels are the four
classic archangels.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.100 align:middle line:90%
Plus, there are more.

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:44.330 align:middle line:90%
So there's Michael.

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:45.140 align:middle line:90%
There's Gabriel.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:46.010 align:middle line:90%
There's Raphael.

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:46.940 align:middle line:90%
There's Uriel.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.610 align:middle line:84%
There are other
archangels as well.

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Some of the archangels
do still incarnate.

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Some of the archangels,
I have regressed clients

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:59.420 align:middle line:84%
that the content is too
specific to be wrong.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.580 align:middle line:84%
They are aspects
of an archangel.

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Certain archangels--
Michael is one example--

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:09.980 align:middle line:84%
have splits on Earth at this
time, again, to try to affect--

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Their projecting a
portion of soul into a human

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:13.820 align:middle line:90%
form.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: That's correct.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:15.710 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:20.720 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So would you say
from the people that are here

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:24.740 align:middle line:10%
for very clear purpose
that you've regressed,

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:29.090 align:middle line:10%
do you see that as fairly common
then for the Earth-based souls

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:29.890 align:middle line:10%
who have split?

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:31.598 align:middle line:84%
Did you see the split
happening in people

00:28:31.598 --> 00:28:33.710 align:middle line:84%
who are very
purposeful and really

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:37.790 align:middle line:84%
trying to do a lot with the soul
in a given time frame like this?

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Yes, I do.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.500 align:middle line:84%
But I also think
it's important to say

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.810 align:middle line:84%
that there are a lot
of Earth-based souls

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:47.180 align:middle line:84%
that are experienced
that don't have splits.

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's not
necessarily the norm,

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:52.170 align:middle line:90%
but it certainly does happen.

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:53.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's interesting.

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.150 align:middle line:84%
So it gives people
something to think about.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:57.770 align:middle line:84%
OK, and thank you
for your definition

00:28:57.770 --> 00:28:59.690 align:middle line:90%
also of the twin flame.

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:03.710 align:middle line:84%
So when I think
of angelic souls,

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:07.520 align:middle line:84%
I think of my late
stepmother, who was--

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.680 align:middle line:84%
she just lived to
love everything.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.230 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing more--

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:15.320 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people thought she was
too simple because she didn't

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.910 align:middle line:90%
have this drive and purpose.

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, that's
a pretty high purpose.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Everyone that touched her and
touched into her life felt seen

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.880 align:middle line:84%
and loved, every baby,
every animal, every adult,

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.750 align:middle line:84%
just a sparkly beautiful
little soul named May--

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:33.712 align:middle line:84%
not little soul but
little woman named May.

00:29:33.712 --> 00:29:35.670 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: Yeah, I mean,
that just brings up--

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:38.700 align:middle line:84%
that's the beauty of
conversation with you and me,

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.090 align:middle line:90%
brings up a couple of things.

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:43.980 align:middle line:84%
One is that when I work
with an angelic soul,

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:48.280 align:middle line:84%
almost always they are some of
the most nonjudgmental people

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.152 align:middle line:90%
I have ever met in my life.

00:29:50.152 --> 00:29:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: She was like that.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.263 align:middle line:90%
No judgment.

00:29:52.263 --> 00:29:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: But the other piece
that's important to say is there

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:59.220 align:middle line:84%
are interplanetary souls that
come from places in the universe

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:02.850 align:middle line:84%
that are also focused
almost completely on heart,

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:04.080 align:middle line:90%
heart energy.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And they are not
angelic souls, but they

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.330 align:middle line:84%
come across that same
way because they're so

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:10.530 align:middle line:90%
feeling oriented.

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:14.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, OK, so I
want to get into these traits

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.220 align:middle line:84%
because people are listening,
thinking, gee, where am I?

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Where's my spouse, where's
my child in all of this?

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:22.530 align:middle line:90%
And so there's another thing.

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:27.270 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about an overlay
also of seven archetypes.

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And last time, we
did not get to that,

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:31.170 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to make
time for it this time.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.830 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the archetypal element

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:36.270 align:middle line:90%
to all of this.

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:38.550 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: So this
came through regression.

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:42.120 align:middle line:84%
I learned this person to
person to person to person.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And what I understand
is that when

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:50.062 align:middle line:84%
we are on Earth, no
matter which type of soul

00:30:50.062 --> 00:30:52.020 align:middle line:84%
we are-- and there's a
slight difference, which

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.840 align:middle line:90%
I'll try to be clear about.

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.310 align:middle line:84%
So an Earth-based
soul like myself,

00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:00.780 align:middle line:84%
I have a soul archetype
that is immortal.

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.060 align:middle line:90%
It's one of seven energies.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.462 align:middle line:84%
None of us seven
are better than--

00:31:05.462 --> 00:31:07.170 align:middle line:84%
one isn't better than
the other, and I'll

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:09.062 align:middle line:90%
give a couple of examples.

00:31:09.062 --> 00:31:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We're going to go
through all seven, by the way.

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: OK.

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:12.990 align:middle line:90%
OK, perfect.

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:13.740 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We have
time to do it.

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:16.322 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: OK, that's perfect.

00:31:16.322 --> 00:31:17.800 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's do that.

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.940 align:middle line:84%
So as an Earth-based soul,
I have a soul archetype.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:22.050 align:middle line:90%
It's unchanging.

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:23.980 align:middle line:90%
It shows up in all my lives.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So OK, so we'll delineate
each of these seven.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.662 align:middle line:84%
The first of the seven,
I like to call it--

00:31:31.662 --> 00:31:33.870 align:middle line:84%
I can use this because the
person's not on the planet

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:34.670 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:37.210 align:middle line:84%
We might call it the
Steve Jobs energy,

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:38.940 align:middle line:90%
meaning it's the change agent.

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.970 align:middle line:84%
You could also call
it the Moses energy.

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:44.320 align:middle line:84%
The change agent of
this isn't working,

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.140 align:middle line:90%
so we're going to make change.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:51.030 align:middle line:84%
It is someone who's very
strong, very directive, pretty

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:56.040 align:middle line:84%
left brained, and says,
I've got to make change.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And the way things are working
isn't going the way it is.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's Steve Jobs, who
obviously created the Apple

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:03.630 align:middle line:90%
computer.

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:05.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know for sure
that Steve Jobs is

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:09.240 align:middle line:84%
what we might call a first
ray soul, but probably he is.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.670 align:middle line:90%
So that's first ray.

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:15.330 align:middle line:84%
I'll add that I had a
mother that was first ray.

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And until I
understood archetypes,

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.620 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get my mother.

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.560 align:middle line:84%
It was like, oh,
she's so specific.

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:26.340 align:middle line:84%
She's sometimes so demanding,
and it's like, aha, she's

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.180 align:middle line:90%
a first ray soul.

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:28.800 align:middle line:90%
So no wonder she's like that.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.390 align:middle line:90%
So that's first ray.

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Second ray flips
over to right brain.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:39.300 align:middle line:84%
It flips over to love, caring,
nurturing, making sure everybody

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:40.470 align:middle line:90%
gets their needs met.

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:44.085 align:middle line:84%
Probably your mother-in-law, I
think, you said or grandmother.

00:32:44.085 --> 00:32:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: My stepmom.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Stepmom.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: Yeah, 10 to 1, your
stepmom was second ray energy.

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.280 align:middle line:84%
It's that deep,
deep, caring person.

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And it could be caring
in front of the scenes

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.310 align:middle line:90%
or behind the scenes.

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:00.730 align:middle line:84%
So it could be
some public figure

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:03.820 align:middle line:84%
that is just so kind and
loving and supportive.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:07.000 align:middle line:84%
But it could be your everyday
neighbor who's just sweet--

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.467 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Like May.

00:33:08.467 --> 00:33:09.550 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: And wonderful.

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:12.880 align:middle line:84%
So that's second ray, and these
keep flipping left brain, right

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.860 align:middle line:90%
brain, left brain, right brain.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Third ray soul-- and I know some
of your listeners are saying,

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:22.030 align:middle line:84%
oh, Linda's talking
about theosophy.

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Linda's talking about the
ray structure of theosophy.

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I am with some expansion
and a little bit of tweaks

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:35.890 align:middle line:84%
to that sort of paradigm
of understanding.

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Third ray soul, actually,
I'm a third ray soul.

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Third rays love to learn and
learn and learn and, ad nauseam,

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:45.700 align:middle line:90%
learn more.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.680 align:middle line:84%
They're wanting
to meld knowledge,

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.170 align:middle line:84%
and then they're wanting
to benefit our culture

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:52.070 align:middle line:90%
by melding knowledge.

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So a third ray soul isn't
just trying to be intellectual

00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:00.880 align:middle line:84%
all the time but is
tasked with understanding

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.240 align:middle line:84%
knowledge and wisdom
and then sharing it

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.340 align:middle line:90%
in one way or another.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:07.990 align:middle line:90%
So that's number three.

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:11.679 align:middle line:90%
Number four, think about--

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:13.300 align:middle line:90%
we can use public figures.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use
someone I've never

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:17.469 align:middle line:84%
regressed, of
course, Frida Kahlo,

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:20.500 align:middle line:84%
one of the more famous
artists on our planet.

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Fourth ray souls are
aesthetic people.

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:27.580 align:middle line:10%
They're into cooking.

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:28.480 align:middle line:90%
They're into art.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.145 align:middle line:90%
They're into design.

00:34:30.145 --> 00:34:34.750 align:middle line:84%
They're into anything that we
think about, melding elements.

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:37.600 align:middle line:90%
They're musicians.

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:41.469 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so fourth ray is
on the feeling side,

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:43.330 align:middle line:90%
but it's on the aesthetic--

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:46.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Artistic in
all its expressions.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.219 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:49.719 align:middle line:84%
Again, and all of these can
be in front of the scenes

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:50.860 align:middle line:90%
and behind the scenes.

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:55.270 align:middle line:84%
OK, and now we have
logistics, fifth ray.

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: So number
five is easy to explain.

00:34:57.490 --> 00:34:58.870 align:middle line:90%
It's probably the easiest.

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:03.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the person who makes
pieces fit together.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the family
member that decides,

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.600 align:middle line:84%
every Thanksgiving, who's
going to bring what.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.400 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I have a friend
that exemplifies that.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:15.610 align:middle line:84%
25 people for six days
every Thanksgiving,

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:18.977 align:middle line:84%
man, that thing is
run like a war room.

00:35:18.977 --> 00:35:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:21.070 align:middle line:90%
It's the implementer.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:23.590 align:middle line:90%
It's the strategy person.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:24.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's impressive.

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: We need
people to do that.

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's impressive.

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Totally.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I'm not that.

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:29.473 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Yeah, totally.

00:35:29.473 --> 00:35:30.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm not that either.

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:32.530 align:middle line:90%
So that's number five.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Number six goes back
to being right brained.

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Number six is like taking
love, compassion and putting it

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:42.500 align:middle line:90%
on steroids.

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.760 align:middle line:90%
It's group cohesion.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.090 align:middle line:90%
It's the neighborhood.

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:49.918 align:middle line:90%
It's the family.

00:35:49.918 --> 00:35:54.670 align:middle line:84%
It's the country,
or it's the person

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:58.713 align:middle line:84%
who is very effective at
international politics.

00:35:58.713 --> 00:36:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was just going
to ask about that, yeah.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.380 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: Yeah,
it's the person--

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:03.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm thinking
about people I know.

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Diplomats,
politicians,

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:08.417 align:middle line:84%
in the highest sense,
would represent that.

00:36:08.417 --> 00:36:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:10.050 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:17.680 align:middle line:84%
How can we make sure that
groups work together effectively

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.970 align:middle line:90%
and with equality?

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:22.640 align:middle line:90%
So it's that egalitarian person.

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.980 align:middle line:90%
So that's number six.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:29.482 align:middle line:84%
It's a caring person
who is strong.

00:36:29.482 --> 00:36:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And you think
they're left brained,

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:35.110 align:middle line:84%
but they're strongly right
brained because of their group

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:36.580 align:middle line:90%
caring energy.

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:38.800 align:middle line:90%
Then lastly, number seven.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.050 align:middle line:84%
Number seven is
the Merlin energy.

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:42.940 align:middle line:90%
It's the humanitarian.

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:47.330 align:middle line:84%
It's the alchemy of
energies one through six.

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:51.650 align:middle line:84%
It's taking each of the six
energies, melding it into one

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and bringing it to the
sustainability and the stability

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:57.830 align:middle line:90%
that we need with humanity.

00:36:57.830 --> 00:36:58.820 align:middle line:90%
So that's number seven.

00:36:58.820 --> 00:36:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're
the alchemists.

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.002 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: That's right.

00:37:01.002 --> 00:37:04.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so this then
comes into the subject of dharma

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.340 align:middle line:84%
because you say that our dharma
carries over from lifetime

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:10.250 align:middle line:84%
to lifetime, which means
it sounds to me like you

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:13.310 align:middle line:84%
can't separate that from
this archetypal energy.

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: No,
absolutely not, because--

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So talk about
yourself, for example.

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Well, your dharma--

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:22.400 align:middle line:90%
dharma meaning soul intention.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:26.480 align:middle line:84%
So again, I'll use myself,
as you're suggesting.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.560 align:middle line:90%
My dharma from my lives--

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:33.290 align:middle line:84%
in other words, what have I
accomplished in my lifetimes--

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:35.300 align:middle line:90%
builds on itself.

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And then when I come
into body again,

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:43.070 align:middle line:84%
I bring the compilation of
all that dharma or all that

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:45.810 align:middle line:90%
what I've accomplished forward.

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean I'm a
perfectly accomplished soul,

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:50.930 align:middle line:84%
that anybody is a perfectly
accomplished soul?

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:52.790 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:54.620 align:middle line:90%
I still have karma to clean up.

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:57.710 align:middle line:84%
I still have intentions
I haven't satisfied,

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:01.340 align:middle line:90%
but our dharma is crucial.

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:02.925 align:middle line:10%
Often, people come
for regression,

00:38:02.925 --> 00:38:04.550 align:middle line:10%
and one of the things
we're going to do

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:06.120 align:middle line:10%
is discover a past life.

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:10.010 align:middle line:84%
So often, the client, before
the regression starts,

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:13.500 align:middle line:84%
says, oh, I don't want to know
I've done something wrong.

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:18.815 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to know that I
was an uninvolved spouse, or--

00:38:18.815 --> 00:38:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They don't want to
see themselves as a bad person.

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: That's right.

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:22.700 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They're scared
of seeing the dark stuff.

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: And I say to them,
when we discover a past life

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.970 align:middle line:84%
today, number one, I don't
choose the past life.

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:32.570 align:middle line:84%
The higher self of my client and
the guides choose the past life.

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:36.080 align:middle line:84%
But I say to the person, you
may learn about dharma today,

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.700 align:middle line:90%
not karma.

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Your guides may want
you to know what

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:42.470 align:middle line:84%
you've accomplished that you
don't give yourself credit for.

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And so often, that
comes forward.

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
and people are--

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:51.950 align:middle line:84%
we have been made over thousands
of years to feel less than.

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:56.090 align:middle line:10%
I mean, in the Judeo-Christian
world, the word "sinner"

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:59.780 align:middle line:10%
is inculcated into your mind and
vocabulary from the time you go

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:01.940 align:middle line:10%
to Sunday school three
four or five years old.

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:02.820 align:middle line:90%
You're a sinner.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:03.620 align:middle line:90%
You're less than.

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:07.760 align:middle line:84%
So of course, people have
a terrible, low self-esteem

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.990 align:middle line:90%
thinking that they're bad.

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:12.320 align:middle line:84%
But my belief is, intrinsically,
most people are good,

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.140 align:middle line:84%
though we've all done some
bad things in our incarnations

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.138 align:middle line:84%
we have to sweep up at
some point, rebalance.

00:39:17.138 --> 00:39:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: Well, and I think
it's how you're putting it too.

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:23.150 align:middle line:84%
It's that most of us
at the core are good.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:24.775 align:middle line:84%
It's behavior that
we need to clean up.

00:39:24.775 --> 00:39:27.275 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah, and you know
what was going on at the time,

00:39:27.275 --> 00:39:28.850 align:middle line:84%
and you just stepped
over the line.

00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:32.817 align:middle line:84%
And well, you'll bounce
that one out down the road.

00:39:32.817 --> 00:39:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Exactly.

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:34.640 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The thing
is there's grace to it.

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.650 align:middle line:84%
There's grace to even
the subject of karma.

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:43.700 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, so yes, thank you for
explaining about that archetypes

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:49.150 align:middle line:84%
and also the continuation of
these urgent desires that we

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:51.790 align:middle line:84%
wish to fulfill in a lifetime
that we end up calling dharma.

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And one thing you've
been looking at

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:56.930 align:middle line:84%
is examining a grief through
the lens of the soul, grief

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:57.730 align:middle line:90%
and loss.

00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And you're writing a
new book, and we're

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:02.770 align:middle line:84%
going to come back after that
book's out and talk about it.

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:07.720 align:middle line:84%
But just give us an idea of what
you're focusing on in this book

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.160 align:middle line:90%
and why.

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: Yeah, and I want
to just quickly come back

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:16.780 align:middle line:84%
to your word "grace" and
then answer your question.

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I agree there is
almost always grace.

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:25.390 align:middle line:84%
I will add, though, because I
learned this through clients,

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:32.440 align:middle line:84%
that if someone is a
despot, if someone has--

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:34.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Psychopath and cruel.

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: --then
when they cross over,

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:41.320 align:middle line:84%
when that life is over, my
understanding is that that soul

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:50.830 align:middle line:84%
must take time to learn
and clean up some of that

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:52.000 align:middle line:90%
inappropriate behavior--

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, that makes sense.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: --before
they come back.

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But we're talking
about a more extreme class

00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:57.820 align:middle line:90%
of psychology.

00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:59.800 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
psychopaths and people

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:00.913 align:middle line:90%
that don't have empathy.

00:41:00.913 --> 00:41:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: That is correct.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.370 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's
not most people.

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:04.000 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: That's right.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:04.800 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So most people
are totally good at heart.

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
bringing that up.

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, we're seeing a rise,
however, in mental illness.

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing a
rise in psychosis

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:20.140 align:middle line:84%
and other types of
mental disorders,

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:24.040 align:middle line:84%
narcissism, and so forth, but
we're not going to go there.

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.540 align:middle line:84%
We have a few minutes
left to talk about grief,

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:28.030 align:middle line:84%
loss through the
lens of the soul.

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: Yeah, so why did I
decide to write another book?

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:36.470 align:middle line:84%
I would say there's probably
two or three reasons.

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:40.180 align:middle line:84%
One is I wanted to
write one more book that

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.440 align:middle line:90%
is almost like a handbook.

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:45.940 align:middle line:84%
It's looking at helping
people, whether they ever

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.760 align:middle line:84%
have a regression or
they don't, helping

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:52.040 align:middle line:84%
them understand with as
much clarity as possible,

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.120 align:middle line:90%
am I Earth based?

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.620 align:middle line:90%
Am I interplanetary?

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.000 align:middle line:90%
Am I angelic?

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.970 align:middle line:84%
The angelic material is not
something I've written about,

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:01.100 align:middle line:90%
so that will be a first.

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:04.160 align:middle line:84%
But to help people
comprehend themselves

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:07.160 align:middle line:90%
and embrace themselves.

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:11.180 align:middle line:10%
Then in addition, I started in
this whole field of psychology

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:14.280 align:middle line:10%
through grief and loss
through my own grief and loss.

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think grief and loss
needs to be understood

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:21.530 align:middle line:84%
not just from an everyday,
conventional perspective

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:24.110 align:middle line:90%
but more from soul.

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Why is there a
particular soul that

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:30.530 align:middle line:84%
either passed three months
ago or 30 years ago,

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:32.750 align:middle line:84%
what's my connection
with that soul?

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:35.660 align:middle line:84%
For what reason has that
affected me so much?

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:39.860 align:middle line:84%
What's going on at the
soul level in terms of--

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's where it
should all be examined from,

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:43.370 align:middle line:90%
in my opinion.

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:44.170 align:middle line:90%
but--

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: Yeah, and
maybe lastly, Regina,

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:52.970 align:middle line:84%
here's where we started with our
discussion is about higher self.

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:56.800 align:middle line:84%
So many people
don't think to talk

00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:00.040 align:middle line:84%
to their higher mind,
their higher self

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.090 align:middle line:90%
and let that support them.

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:05.350 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole
chapter in guidance on how

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:07.520 align:middle line:90%
to connect with higher self.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:11.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it was time to
dig in and write another book.

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I'm glad
you are because, as I said

00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:16.185 align:middle line:84%
in the open, that's the missing
ingredient for almost all

00:43:16.185 --> 00:43:18.490 align:middle line:84%
of humanity, and we have
to snap out of that.

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:22.750 align:middle line:84%
We cannot afford to continue
to just bump around in the dark

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and bump into each other and
say, hey, it's good enough.

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:29.770 align:middle line:84%
The times that we're entering
are demanding more of us

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:30.650 align:middle line:90%
than that.

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:35.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's time to start
getting to know thyself.

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:36.490 align:middle line:90%
>> BACKMAN: Absolutely.

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:39.370 align:middle line:84%
Thyself in the greatest
and then largest way.

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, any final
thoughts before we say goodbye?

00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>> BACKMAN: I mean, I'll just
say that I think if people

00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:51.700 align:middle line:84%
accept themselves more, if
people accept that what they

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.880 align:middle line:84%
think is a flaw, like
a fear, a phobia,

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:59.950 align:middle line:84%
something they can't let go
of, dig in deeper and know that

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:04.840 align:middle line:84%
it's something at the soul
level that if you understand it

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.150 align:middle line:84%
and know what it's
about, you can let it go.

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:11.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a flaw or
something that's wrong with you.

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:11.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

And I know it's a
little trite, but that's

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:16.000 align:middle line:84%
where even things like
journaling come in,

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.700 align:middle line:84%
where you just let it flow,
get it out, go back, and look

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:21.070 align:middle line:84%
at it with this lens
that we're talking about.

00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And you start learning
about yourself

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.470 align:middle line:90%
and where that's coming from.

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:25.910 align:middle line:90%
So absolutely beautiful.

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:27.610 align:middle line:84%
I love your work,
and I'll look forward

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:29.500 align:middle line:84%

your next book's out.
