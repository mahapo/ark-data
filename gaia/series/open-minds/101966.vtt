00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.530 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Andrea Perron is with us

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.380 align:middle line:10%
once again to finish our
trilogy of conversations

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.230 align:middle line:10%
based on her trilogy of
books, "House of Darkness,

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.280 align:middle line:10%
House of Light."

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Andrea and her
family experienced

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.960 align:middle line:84%
what's considered to be one
of the most dramatic examples

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.050 align:middle line:84%
of harassment by
disincarnate entities,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.860 align:middle line:90%
or ghosts, ever recorded.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Today, we'll talk
about the aftereffects

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.150 align:middle line:84%
and how people live their
lives after such a trauma.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.520 align:middle line:90%
And I have a funny little thing.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, so when I saw
you the first time,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.120 align:middle line:84%
six to eight weeks ago,
when we did our very few

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.530 align:middle line:84%
first interview, I
met you to pick up

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.760 align:middle line:84%
a copy of one of your
books in your hotel room

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.130 align:middle line:84%
at the Boulderado, which is
known to be haunted, right?

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.319 align:middle line:84%
And you didn't
know that, I think,

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.402 align:middle line:90%
when you first checked in.

00:01:05.402 --> 00:01:07.500 align:middle line:84%
But you figured it
out, and you said to me

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:84%
I asked them for the
most haunted room.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And I thought after
reading that, why?

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.830 align:middle line:84%
So why is it you love haunted
houses and haunted rooms?

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.240 align:middle line:10%
>>ANDREA PERRON: I can visit
with the spirits with ease.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.410 align:middle line:10%
Now, they don't come
when called all the time.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.210 align:middle line:10%
Neither does anything else.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Our friends above, they seem to
exercise their own free will.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And yet if I put myself
in an environment

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.000 align:middle line:84%
where I know that
they're around and about,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.620 align:middle line:84%
it's very easy for me to
communicate with them.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And I think that helps
keep the channel open.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.100 align:middle line:90%
And I know that it always is.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.170 align:middle line:84%
I lecture all over the country,
and I upset some people

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.320 align:middle line:84%
in the paranormal because
they're all into ooh,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.510 align:middle line:90%
the veil is thinning.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.550 align:middle line:90%
The veil is thinning.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.010 align:middle line:90%
It's the paradigm shift.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.070 align:middle line:90%
It's the ascension.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, there's no veil.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.830 align:middle line:90%
There is no veil.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.820 align:middle line:84%
That is something that
we create so that we

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.400 align:middle line:84%
feel comfortable living
in a three dimensional

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.930 align:middle line:90%
five sensory universe-- world.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.970 align:middle line:84%
But we actually live
in a multi-dimensional,

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.220 align:middle line:90%
multi-sensory universe.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
certainly you have

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and your family has been very
well aware of that, I mean,

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.490 align:middle line:84%
from bizarre things
happening, oftentimes even

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.180 align:middle line:84%
comical-- things like
you're playing the piano

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and someone who you
can't see is turning

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.750 align:middle line:90%
the pages of the music for you.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it comes
down to something

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.010 align:middle line:84%
as simple as that to some
really horrific things as well.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.270 align:middle line:84%
You are steeped in this
multi-dimensional universe.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.779 align:middle line:90%
And I want to go back.

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:49.320 align:middle line:84%
We mentioned it in
the last interview

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.080 align:middle line:90%
and did not pick up on it then.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with
the night of the seance

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.880 align:middle line:90%
and what happened.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get out
of the gore of all this

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and work our way toward much
larger themes and messages.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.830 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to punish
you for an hour with more

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:03.360 align:middle line:90%
phenomena.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.040 align:middle line:84%
There's too much to
even begin to get into.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: That was the most
intense experience of my life.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.250 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't supposed to be there.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.060 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't supposed to witness it.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Set up the
whole situation for us.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.677 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: The Warrens called
on a Friday afternoon.

00:03:18.677 --> 00:03:20.260 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: And again
to refresh people,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.850 align:middle line:10%
the Warrens were the UFO
paranormal investigators.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.940 align:middle line:10%
They had deeply
Catholic backgrounds.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.650 align:middle line:10%
>>PERRON: Yes, they did.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.990 align:middle line:10%
In the film it was portrayed
as the devout, Catholic Warrens

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.459 align:middle line:10%
and the godless,
heathen Perrons.

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were
all Catholics too.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.291 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: We were all Catholic.

00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:38.670 align:middle line:84%
My father was an altar boy,
grew up in Catholic school.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.900 align:middle line:90%
We were all baptized.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So all
of you had that.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Yes, I understand
why they did what they

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.962 align:middle line:90%
did to create that dichotomy.

00:03:44.962 --> 00:03:46.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In "The Conjuring."

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Yes, but it
really wasn't accurate.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.762 align:middle line:90%


00:03:51.762 --> 00:03:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So who
called the seance?

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.261 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Ed and Lorraine
Warren called my mother

00:03:55.261 --> 00:03:56.450 align:middle line:90%
on a Friday afternoon.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.130 align:middle line:84%
My dad was supposed to be
arriving home that night,

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.750 align:middle line:90%
and they said could we come?

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, ugh,
Roger's coming home.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And they said no, he
needs to be there.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.590 align:middle line:90%
And they were insistent.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Lorraine was insistent,
and she could be that way.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And so they didn't
tell her anything

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.700 align:middle line:84%
other than that
they were coming.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And when my father came home,
we were having dinner together

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.290 align:middle line:84%
and Mom said to Dad the Warrens
are coming this evening.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.170 align:middle line:90%
Well, he threw a fit.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.469 align:middle line:84%
He said you know I
don't want any company.

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was before
the days of cellphones.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.980 align:middle line:84%
They were already on
their way driving in

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.430 align:middle line:90%
from Monroe, Connecticut.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did he not
care for the Warrens?

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.399 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: He did not
care for them at all.

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:39.422 align:middle line:90%
He considered them--

00:04:39.422 --> 00:04:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He was still
having a hard time

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.575 align:middle line:84%
contending that
this was even real,

00:04:42.575 --> 00:04:43.890 align:middle line:84%
no less people were
coming to examine it.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Right. because
it was pretty early on.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.590 align:middle line:90%
It was 1973.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Actually, by that
time it was '74,

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.640 align:middle line:90%
and it was in the summer of '74.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.150 align:middle line:84%
I think it was in
July or August.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:90%
I remember it was quite warm.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And my mother immediately
told all of us

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.830 align:middle line:84%
to find a friend to spend the
night with because my father

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.930 align:middle line:84%
was so aggravated that they
were coming that she didn't

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.450 align:middle line:90%
want there to be a scene.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.440 align:middle line:84%
She had no idea
what their plan was.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.980 align:middle line:84%
They did not
divulge that to her.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.530 align:middle line:84%
When they came, they
came with a caravan.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.881 align:middle line:84%
They had a priest, a
medium, a technical crew.

00:05:22.881 --> 00:05:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that
showed up in the film

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.500 align:middle line:84%
that they had brought people
along with them, right?

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Yes, only it
was a lot more people.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And in the film, they had,
I guess, the validation

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.330 align:middle line:84%
of having a police
officer with them.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.830 align:middle line:90%
Uh-uh.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.130 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'll explain
that in a little bit.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, my father hit the roof.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Nancy was the only one
that made the great escape.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.330 align:middle line:90%
She went over to Katie's house.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.990 align:middle line:84%
We all tried to find somebody
to go spend the night with.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And it was a Friday
night and was

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.680 align:middle line:84%
nobody was available so
four of the five of us

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.340 align:middle line:90%
were in the house that night.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Nothing should have
happened in that house

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.260 align:middle line:90%
with us being in there.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260 align:middle line:90%


00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.370 align:middle line:90%
They came in.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.220 align:middle line:90%
They had a medium.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Her name was Mary
Pastorella, I believe

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.030 align:middle line:84%
was her last name, and
a priest-- lovely man,

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.340 align:middle line:90%
truly lovely.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.890 align:middle line:84%
They had a young woman who was
running the reel to reel tape.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.610 align:middle line:84%
They had all state of the
art humongous cameras, just

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.920 align:middle line:84%
gigantic cameras, tripods--
all kinds of things.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, when my father
saw the caravan show up,

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.850 align:middle line:90%
he just went ballistic.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And Lorraine came in the
house, and she really

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.830 align:middle line:84%
made matters worse
because she said,

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.990 align:middle line:84%
if you care about your
wife, if you love your wife,

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.700 align:middle line:90%
you will let this go on.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.600 align:middle line:84%
You're losing her,
don't you understand?

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.250 align:middle line:84%
She's being taken from you
and we have to stop this now.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.590 align:middle line:84%
It took Ed about 45 minutes
in private conversation

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.797 align:middle line:90%
to convince my father.

00:06:51.797 --> 00:06:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Couldn't he
see your mother's life

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.620 align:middle line:90%
was slipping away?

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: He could.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.377 align:middle line:90%
He could, but he blamed her.

00:06:58.377 --> 00:06:58.960 align:middle line:90%
He blamed her.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.501 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just
thought she was nutty,

00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:02.522 align:middle line:84%
and she was frightened,
and making stuff up.

00:07:02.522 --> 00:07:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I don't
know what he thought.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.070 align:middle line:84%
I think he was just so
afraid to actually believe

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.280 align:middle line:84%
the truth that he had to play
the blame game, you know?

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.762 align:middle line:84%
And she was the
recipient of his blame.

00:07:13.762 --> 00:07:15.845 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So after 45
minutes, they convinced him.

00:07:15.845 --> 00:07:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: They convinced him.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.430 align:middle line:90%
We were all told to go upstairs.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.490 align:middle line:90%
We didn't stay upstairs.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Cindy and I-- Christine
went and hid in her room,

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.860 align:middle line:84%
in the middle room, and
she heard everything

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.260 align:middle line:84%
because what was happening
was right below her.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.180 align:middle line:90%
She was in the center bedroom.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.170 align:middle line:84%
She pretended like
she was asleep,

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.780 align:middle line:84%
but that was one of
the most traumatizing

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.980 align:middle line:90%
events of her life.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.671 align:middle line:84%
April was still
young, very young.

00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you were
always, all of you,

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.870 align:middle line:90%
were trying to protect April.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: We were
trying to protect April.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't know what to
make of-- my mother started

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.680 align:middle line:84%
shutting down as soon as
they came in the house.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
if she shut down

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.620 align:middle line:84%
because of the incredibly
negative energy that

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:84%
was emanating from my father,
or if something else was

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.050 align:middle line:90%
taking control.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.210 align:middle line:90%
And that's plausible.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.280 align:middle line:84%
But she was sitting
in the corner chair,

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.490 align:middle line:84%
just her eyes closed and her
head just started going down.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:19.010 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like she was
caving into her own body.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.600 align:middle line:90%
They gathered around the table.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:84%
The medium pulled
out a little pouch

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:28.650 align:middle line:84%
of her accoutrement--
candles, you

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.290 align:middle line:84%
know, all the
stereotypical stuff

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.900 align:middle line:84%
that you think around a
seance-- no Ouija board.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Mrs. Warren would not allow
Ouija boards or their usage.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.330 align:middle line:84%
She uses them now, but she
wouldn't use them then.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.919 align:middle line:90%
And they dimmed the lights.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.630 align:middle line:84%
There were people walking
all over the place taking

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:47.500 align:middle line:90%
photographs.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.110 align:middle line:84%
They had set up all the
camera equipment in the cellar

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:52.610 align:middle line:84%
and then come back
up, and they were

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:56.300 align:middle line:84%
taking photographs, the two
men that were the tech crew.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And then the woman was
running the reel to reel.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.040 align:middle line:84%
She was a young woman,
like an apprentice.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.580 align:middle line:90%
It didn't take long.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.430 align:middle line:84%
As soon as Mary began
to conjure the spirits,

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:10.170 align:middle line:84%
she committed what I consider
to be spiritual malpractice.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:15.370 align:middle line:84%
She threw open wide the doors
and invited them all in.

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And what came in--
this was not possession

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.580 align:middle line:84%
as it was represented
in the film.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.320 align:middle line:90%
This was attack.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if it
was demonic nature, if it

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.710 align:middle line:90%
was extraterrestrial in nature.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.210 align:middle line:90%
I still don't know.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:30.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what a demon is.

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:31.600 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen a demon.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.970 align:middle line:90%
Something attacked my mother.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:38.740 align:middle line:84%
The first thing that happened
was the 200 pound solid rock

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:43.150 align:middle line:84%
maple table began to
lift off the floor.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.710 align:middle line:90%
My father was freaking out.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:46.370 align:middle line:84%
He just didn't want
any part of it.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.580 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to hold
hands with anybody.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.740 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to make a
connection with anybody.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.490 align:middle line:90%
He didn't want to be there.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And the table lifted
I'd say probably

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.789 align:middle line:90%
about that much off the floor.

00:09:56.789 --> 00:09:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Three or
four inches, yeah?

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:58.913 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Mhm.

00:09:58.913 --> 00:10:00.160 align:middle line:90%
No more than that.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
it was as if the hand of God

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.630 align:middle line:84%
slammed down on that
table, and it hit the floor

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:12.830 align:middle line:84%
so hard that it left
imprints in the wood floor.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And then something
came into my mother.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.090 align:middle line:84%
I will do my best to
express this to you.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.610 align:middle line:90%
Just stay right with me.

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:90%
This is hard.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.330 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:90%
Something came into her.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.580 align:middle line:84%
She was sitting in
a captain's chair.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.740 align:middle line:84%
One of the two head
of the table chairs.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.970 align:middle line:84%
It had to weigh 40 pounds
if it weighed and ounce.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And she was sitting in the
chair, and her head was down.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.280 align:middle line:90%
She was slumped over.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.740 align:middle line:90%
And her head started to lift up.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.710 align:middle line:90%
And she started to moan.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:45.930 align:middle line:90%
And she was in pain.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Cindy and I are standing,
hiding in the front hallway.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.820 align:middle line:84%
There's about that
much of a gap,

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.860 align:middle line:84%
but we can see everything
that's going on and hiding.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm holding Cindy
in my arms close to me.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And my mother started to make
these horrific sounds, just

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.740 align:middle line:90%
pain.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.790 align:middle line:90%
It was pain.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And then her body started to
draw up into a ball in ways

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.470 align:middle line:90%
that a human body does not bend.

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:21.210 align:middle line:84%
You would expect to hear
the sound of bones snapping.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.940 align:middle line:90%
And then she started to growl.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And then she started to
speak in a language that

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.910 align:middle line:90%
is not of this Earth.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.760 align:middle line:84%
It was beyond an
archaic language.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.030 align:middle line:84%
It was from a being that I don't
know ever walked this Earth.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.550 align:middle line:84%
But whatever it
was came into her

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:43.450 align:middle line:84%
and started speaking to
everyone in the room.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.900 align:middle line:84%
Mrs. Warren was shocked
out of her mind.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Ed didn't know
what to make of it.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.490 align:middle line:84%
The medium was rocking
back and forth,

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.260 align:middle line:84%
just rocking almost like she
was caught in a whirlwind that

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.670 align:middle line:90%
kept pulling her.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.400 align:middle line:90%
And she's talking and saying no.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.290 align:middle line:90%
Speak your piece.

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Why are you here?

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.320 align:middle line:90%
What have you come to say?

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And my mom started screaming,
screaming in agony.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And then the chair began
to lift up off the floor.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And when what is about a foot
off the floor, perhaps more,

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:20.970 align:middle line:84%
in a split second, in
a fraction of a second,

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:25.050 align:middle line:84%
she was thrown in the
chair from the dining room

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:28.220 align:middle line:84%
20 feet into the
adjacent parlor.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.995 align:middle line:90%
I heard her skull hit the floor.

00:12:29.995 --> 00:12:36.800 align:middle line:90%


00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.216 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I
saw my mother die.

00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:42.190 align:middle line:90%


00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it was
had all the power

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
it could ever need
to claim her life.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.190 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't its intention.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Its intention was to
make its presence known

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:59.210 align:middle line:90%
to everyone else in that house.

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Could it, do you
think, have been in part maybe

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:05.060 align:middle line:84%
even to show your
father once and for all?

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.030 align:middle line:90%
Now do you get it?

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Perhaps.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps so, but my
impression of it-- well,

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.430 align:middle line:90%
Cindy was collapsing in my arms.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And I was so afraid to
drop her because she

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.305 align:middle line:90%
was becoming dead weight.

00:13:20.305 --> 00:13:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And if she fell forward,
we both would have gone

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.790 align:middle line:90%
through the dining room door.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And we work terrified
of what my father would

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.520 align:middle line:90%
do if that happened.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:34.040 align:middle line:84%
So not only were we out of
our minds in terror about what

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.490 align:middle line:84%
was actually happening, we
were afraid to be discovered.

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:39.120 align:middle line:90%


00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:44.150 align:middle line:84%
My father leapt up from the
table to rush to my mother.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Ed Warren stopped him,
tried to stop him,

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.720 align:middle line:84%
and my father turned around
and punched his lights out.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, coldcocked him,
took the man to the floor.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And I know for a fact he broke
his nose because at 2 o'clock

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.700 align:middle line:84%
that morning I was
cleaning the blood up off

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.320 align:middle line:84%
of the wood with
peroxide, trying

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.320 align:middle line:90%
to preserve the wood floors.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.190 align:middle line:90%
I was wide awake.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:07.720 align:middle line:84%
There was no
sleeping that night,

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.880 align:middle line:90%
so I had to do something.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.950 align:middle line:84%
It took about 45 minutes
for my mother to come back.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.280 align:middle line:90%
It was before the days of 9/11.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Believe me when I tell you I
wanted to call and get someone

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.790 align:middle line:84%
there to help my
mother, but Mrs. Warren

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.350 align:middle line:84%
made it very clear
that no one would

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:29.400 align:middle line:84%
be calling for help, that they
would handle this internally

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.362 align:middle line:90%
in house, as it were.

00:14:31.362 --> 00:14:33.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interesting they felt
powerful enough to do that.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And my father wouldn't
leave my mother's side

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:40.340 align:middle line:84%
because he was monitoring
her vital signs.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.570 align:middle line:84%
After a few minutes, we realized
that she was still with us,

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.390 align:middle line:90%
but she was unconscious.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And it did take about-- Dad
thinks it took about an hour,

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.860 align:middle line:84%
but my recollection
was more like a half

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:53.760 align:middle line:84%
hour, 45 minutes
to bring her back

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.930 align:middle line:84%
in the interim in some
incredibly colorful language.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:01.130 align:middle line:84%
My father was livid,
out of his mind,

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.960 align:middle line:84%
and he insisted that the
Warrens leave and they

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.740 align:middle line:90%
take their entourage with them.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Mrs. Warren told
the photographers

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:13.760 align:middle line:84%
to go down into the cellar
and gather their equipment.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And when they got
down there, they

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.920 align:middle line:84%
found that their
tripods, their cameras,

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.740 align:middle line:84%
all their electronic
equipment had

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:24.500 align:middle line:84%
been smashed to smithereens
on the walls, the granite

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.160 align:middle line:90%
walls of the basement.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Everything was in pieces,
hundreds if not thousands

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.070 align:middle line:90%
of pieces.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Those two grown men
came up those stairs

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.920 align:middle line:90%
very quickly sobbing.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.620 align:middle line:90%
It was a total loss for them.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:38.620 align:middle line:90%
They left the house.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.060 align:middle line:84%
They went and stayed out
in the van and waited.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.480 align:middle line:84%
The young lady gathered
up the reel to reel.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.540 align:middle line:90%
She had played it back.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.960 align:middle line:90%
There was no noise on it at all.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.320 align:middle line:84%
You know how you twist
it back and play it back?

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.660 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.960 align:middle line:90%
Nothing was caught on tape.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Nothing was caught
on film-- nothing.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.860 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't supposed to be.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.480 align:middle line:90%


00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.250 align:middle line:84%
She gathered her stuff
and went outside.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:06.600 align:middle line:84%
Mary Pastorella refused to
leave my mother's side no matter

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.550 align:middle line:90%
how much my father screamed.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.891 align:middle line:84%
I thought the priest was
going to just collapse.

00:16:10.891 --> 00:16:13.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was as white as
the sheets in front of you.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.720 align:middle line:84%
He was trembling
from head to toe.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.110 align:middle line:84%
He was a very tall, lean
man, and he was just

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:middle line:84%
hiding in the corner, just
literally trying to get small

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and just watching, overseeing
everything as an observer

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:30.270 align:middle line:90%
himself.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Ed Warren, after my father
punched him, he came through.

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.820 align:middle line:84%
He was going to go through
to go to the bathroom

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.240 align:middle line:84%
and walked right into
Cindy and myself.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And I remember he was a big
man, and he just took his arms

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.040 align:middle line:84%
and just embraced
both of us at once

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.900 align:middle line:84%
and said he was so
sorry, so sorry.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And girls, I want
you to go upstairs.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.110 align:middle line:90%
And I said, Cindy, let's go.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle line:90%
Well, what did we do?

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.200 align:middle line:84%
We went upstairs
into Nancy's room,

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.480 align:middle line:84%
cut through the entire
top of the house,

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.450 align:middle line:84%
came back down the other
stairway where we found

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:04.229 align:middle line:84%
April, who was watching
everything from there.

00:17:04.229 --> 00:17:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And how old
was she by this time?

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Seven.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:06.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Seven?

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:08.105 align:middle line:90%
She was still very young, yes.

00:17:08.105 --> 00:17:08.261 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Eight.

00:17:08.261 --> 00:17:08.844 align:middle line:90%
She was eight.

00:17:08.844 --> 00:17:09.619 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:11.819 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: She was
completely traumatized.

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:13.290 align:middle line:90%
Cindy was traumatized.

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Christine, I knew
she wasn't asleep

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.540 align:middle line:84%
because I could literally
see the quilt quivering

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.920 align:middle line:90%
with her body beneath it.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When your
mother came back around,

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:28.329 align:middle line:84%
did she have any understanding,
any recollection?

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:31.325 align:middle line:84%
Was there anything she had
to say at all about what

00:17:31.325 --> 00:17:32.385 align:middle line:90%
had happened to her?

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is one of
the most unfortunate things.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:42.180 align:middle line:84%
My father did expel the
Warrens from the house.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.010 align:middle line:90%
They did leave.

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:46.270 align:middle line:84%
They took everything that
they had and they left.

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And my father
lifted my mother up,

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:51.590 align:middle line:84%
and he put her over
on the long sofa.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.880 align:middle line:84%
While he was doing
that, April snuck down

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:58.080 align:middle line:84%
and curled into a ball on
the loveseat under a blanket

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and tried to hide so that--
she was so afraid for Mom.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.400 align:middle line:90%
We all were.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And when my mother
finally came around

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.670 align:middle line:84%
and was able to lift her
own body up off the sofa,

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:16.300 align:middle line:84%
she didn't understand
and knew nothing,

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.330 align:middle line:84%
had no recollection of
anything that had happened.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:23.440 align:middle line:84%
All she knew was that her
whole body was in pain.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.070 align:middle line:84%
A huge welt on the
back of her head-- I'm

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.170 align:middle line:90%
sure she had a concussion.

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.770 align:middle line:90%


00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's when my
father verbally attacked

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:37.580 align:middle line:84%
her and blamed her
for letting them come.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Said that she was
a witch, that she

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:43.440 align:middle line:84%
was the one that had attracted
all of this into the house,

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.570 align:middle line:90%
that this was all on her.

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And mom had gone
over to-- her body

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.990 align:middle line:90%
was so cold she was shaking.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And she went and stood in
front of the fireplace.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was summer,
but it was almost

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.110 align:middle line:84%
like standing in front
of the fireplace,

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.700 align:middle line:84%
even though it
was no fire in it,

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.370 align:middle line:90%
somehow she would be warmer?

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:04.634 align:middle line:90%
If that makes any sense.

00:19:04.634 --> 00:19:06.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Seems
like the fireplace

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.977 align:middle line:84%
was her refuge because your
house was so cold all the time.

00:19:08.977 --> 00:19:09.560 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Mhm.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.650 align:middle line:90%
It was.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And that was a very active
hot spot, no pun intended.

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And my father was
just railing on her.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And she looked over and
saw April was on the sofa.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And he turned around,
realized that he

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.850 align:middle line:84%
was behaving this way right
in front of his baby girl.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:33.190 align:middle line:84%
So he turned around
and attacked her

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:34.707 align:middle line:84%
and started screaming
at her about

00:19:34.707 --> 00:19:36.290 align:middle line:84%
what the hell are
you doing down here?

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:37.940 align:middle line:90%
Get your ass upstairs.

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Ugly, ugly, ugly,
mean, horrible,

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.650 align:middle line:90%
mean spirited in every way.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:46.970 align:middle line:84%
That was the worst
night of my life.

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I don't think
it is a stretch for anyone

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:51.940 align:middle line:90%
to believe that.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it took you
30 years, more than 30 years

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:57.940 align:middle line:90%
to talk about it.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And people see you and
they see how-- wow.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.320 align:middle line:90%
She's a firecracker.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.430 align:middle line:90%
She's a strong woman.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:06.780 align:middle line:84%
These beings follow her around,
as we've talked about before.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:10.320 align:middle line:90%
And you've had contact from ETs.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.660 align:middle line:90%
You've been through it all.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.130 align:middle line:84%
But anyone seeing you as
you're talking about this

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:19.560 align:middle line:84%
and recalling it, you hold a
tremendous amount of trauma

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.310 align:middle line:84%
still in your being
on some level.

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:25.870 align:middle line:90%
It's still coming out your eyes.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Tell us what happened
in those intervening 30,

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.670 align:middle line:84%
40 years before you
finally wrote the books

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:34.750 align:middle line:84%
and you were nudged, and how
you were nudged to do it.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And you didn't do this in
those intervening years,

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.740 align:middle line:90%
and nor did your sisters.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And I asked you if I could
have a little interview

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.150 align:middle line:84%
with your mother, and
she said no, uh-uh.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:44.610 align:middle line:90%
We don't do that now.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:49.810 align:middle line:84%
What happened during all
those quiet years that

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:53.070 align:middle line:84%
would've assisted you
or not, all of you,

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:57.860 align:middle line:84%
to integrate this stuff
and somehow at least

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:00.847 align:middle line:90%
distant you from all the trauma?

00:21:00.847 --> 00:21:02.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I discovered in
writing the books that I

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:05.470 align:middle line:90%
had a great deal of help.

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:08.640 align:middle line:84%
They all came around me
and gathered around me.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.680 align:middle line:84%
There were nights that
I was working late 2, 3,

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.970 align:middle line:84%
4 o'clock in the
morning, and the tears

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:17.630 align:middle line:84%
would be flowing-- just
flowing down my face,

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:21.340 align:middle line:84%
and I felt free to do
that because my mom wasn't

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.040 align:middle line:90%
up to see it.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.470 align:middle line:90%
It would have upset her.

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:25.200 align:middle line:90%
Christine wasn't up to see it.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.350 align:middle line:90%
It would have upset her.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:29.600 align:middle line:90%
So I just let it out.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And there were times I
literally pushed myself away

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.670 align:middle line:84%
from the desk and
said I can't do this.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Whatever made me
think I could do this?

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To recall in
such detail all of it?

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.087 align:middle line:90%
You had to be reliving it.

00:21:44.087 --> 00:21:45.295 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It was branded in--

00:21:45.295 --> 00:21:46.685 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You can tell
when you were writing this,

00:21:46.685 --> 00:21:47.680 align:middle line:90%
you were reliving it.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: It was
branded in my brain.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
happened those 30 years?

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:52.172 align:middle line:90%
What happened to you?

00:21:52.172 --> 00:21:52.880 align:middle line:90%
Where did you go?

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:53.463 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:21:53.463 --> 00:21:54.980 align:middle line:90%
What happened to your sisters?

00:21:54.980 --> 00:22:00.450 align:middle line:84%
How did you each contend
with such a severe degree

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.210 align:middle line:84%
of bizarre trauma, trauma
you couldn't really even talk

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:04.390 align:middle line:90%
to other people about?

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: No, we couldn't.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in volume three, I go
into great detail about that.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.540 align:middle line:84%
It was very traumatizing
to leave the farm.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.500 align:middle line:90%
It fractured our family.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.155 align:middle line:84%
It's the only place that
I have ever felt at home,

00:22:19.155 --> 00:22:20.565 align:middle line:90%
that I belonged.

00:22:20.565 --> 00:22:21.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I know
people hear this

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.320 align:middle line:84%
and they say, why didn't you
leave the first six months?

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I know.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:26.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We talked
about that in part one.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:26.740 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes, we did.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There were
a lot of real estate

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:28.660 align:middle line:90%
and monetary things.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.199 align:middle line:84%
You guys couldn't
get out of there.

00:22:30.199 --> 00:22:32.365 align:middle line:84%
You would never be able to
sell the place for what--

00:22:32.365 --> 00:22:34.860 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: No, but the real
answer to that question,

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.220 align:middle line:84%
the significant
profound answer is

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.040 align:middle line:84%
that whatever
conspired to bring us

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:43.060 align:middle line:84%
there likewise conspired to
keep us there until we learned

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:46.880 align:middle line:84%
our lessons well, until we
understood that with darkness

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:53.180 align:middle line:84%
comes light, and that they are
the source of enlightenment.

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your mother
said we've gotta get out

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:56.680 align:middle line:90%
of this godforsaken place.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.310 align:middle line:84%
She begged your dad what we
do to get rid of this place

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:00.890 align:middle line:90%
and get the girls out?

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:05.510 align:middle line:84%
And each time, the girls, they
would say this is our home.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:06.682 align:middle line:90%
We love it here!

00:23:06.682 --> 00:23:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: But we didn't know.

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is it some kind
of Stockholm Syndrome?

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.490 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: No, it wasn't that.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:15.090 align:middle line:84%
We really, truly
felt at home there.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And what was happening
to us was not

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:20.280 align:middle line:84%
anywhere near as severe as what
was happening to my mother,

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and of course she
was not sharing that.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:27.280 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't know how the
extent of how bad it was.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.810 align:middle line:90%
I was the only that did.

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And I told my mother a long
time ago when I was quite young,

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.500 align:middle line:84%
no matter where you
go, I will follow you.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:40.190 align:middle line:84%
I will be with you,
whatever it is.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:42.510 align:middle line:84%
But it really did
fracture our family.

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:48.080 align:middle line:84%
When my mother went to my father
in the spring of '79 and said

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.070 align:middle line:84%
I won't survive another
winter in this house,

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:53.214 align:middle line:90%
and he believed her.

00:23:53.214 --> 00:23:54.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He finally got it.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: He finally got it.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And they put it on
the market where

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:00.980 align:middle line:84%
it languished for six months,
not a single call, not

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.850 align:middle line:90%
a single showing-- nothing.

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And finally out of
just sheer frustration,

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:10.210 align:middle line:84%
he went to the abutting
landowners in Massachusetts--

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:13.690 align:middle line:84%
because we had 60 acres
of land in Mass, too--

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:16.774 align:middle line:84%
and cut them the sweetest
deal you can imagine.

00:24:16.774 --> 00:24:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mister-- what was
the name of the man that

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.300 align:middle line:90%
owned the house before you?

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.174 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Mr. Kenyon.

00:24:21.174 --> 00:24:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Mr. Kenyon didn't
disclose any anomalies

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.024 align:middle line:90%
to your family.

00:24:24.024 --> 00:24:24.690 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Right.

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:26.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You got to
find out on your own.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And did your family disclose
the anomalies to the new buyers?

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Everybody in
the area knew by then.

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK, and who--

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.799 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: But they lived
in a haunted house too.

00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:37.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, every house in
that area was haunted.

00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:38.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: OK, so they
were accustomed to it.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.750 align:middle line:84%
It's like, hey, sweet
deal, lots of land.

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.000 align:middle line:90%
They can deal with the spooks.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Right, and they had
no idea how severe things were.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000 align:middle line:84%
They just knew that the
word was the parents

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.600 align:middle line:84%
are in the old Arnold
Estate, and the Arnold Estate

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.930 align:middle line:90%
is haunted.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:55.389 align:middle line:84%
But they had no
idea how severely--

00:24:55.389 --> 00:24:57.013 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How long
did they stay there?

00:24:57.013 --> 00:24:58.310 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what happened?

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:00.475 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Well,
actually, the reason

00:25:00.475 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:84%
that it fractured
our family-- we never

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.340 align:middle line:84%
lived under the same
roof again because when

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:09.390 align:middle line:84%
my father sold the property
to them, my parents did,

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:11.650 align:middle line:90%
we bought a farm in Georgia.

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And I graduated from
college, came home,

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.620 align:middle line:90%
was home like two weeks.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.550 align:middle line:90%
And then Cindy had already left.

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:20.790 align:middle line:84%
She was already
gone with the horses

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.870 align:middle line:84%
and setting up the new
house in Salacoa Valley

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:27.100 align:middle line:90%
in Cherokee County, Georgia.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.500 align:middle line:84%
So Nancy was still
there, and Nancy

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:33.160 align:middle line:84%
had gone over to the
new owners and said

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:38.550 align:middle line:84%
I know you want to restore the
house to its colonial time.

00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I'll stay on as the
caretaker for free.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.520 align:middle line:90%
Nancy was devastated.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.705 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to this day, has
not forgiven my mother--

00:25:46.705 --> 00:25:48.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: For
selling that house.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.455 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: For
selling that house.

00:25:49.455 --> 00:25:51.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's such
a bizarre dynamic.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I know, but
it got even stranger.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Because her boyfriend, Eddie
Richardson, when we left,

00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:59.820 align:middle line:90%
he moved in.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And every time he
came to the house,

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:04.380 align:middle line:90%
it always got very active.

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:06.240 align:middle line:84%
But it was his
great-great grandfather

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.660 align:middle line:90%
that built the house.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:13.330 align:middle line:84%
He was of direct lineage
of the man who built it.

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And it was always active
when Eddie was there,

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and he took no
mind to it at all.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:21.430 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's where
Bathsheba's curse started,

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.970 align:middle line:90%
that phrase.

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:23.420 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't Bathsheba.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.830 align:middle line:84%
She copped all the blame
because Mrs. Warren

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:26.950 align:middle line:90%
said it was Bathsheba.

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:28.650 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't her.

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Not that she was always
pleasant, but she wasn't evil.

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:37.619 align:middle line:84%
After Eddie moved into the house
with Nancy, everything changed.

00:26:37.619 --> 00:26:38.160 align:middle line:90%
We were gone.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.030 align:middle line:90%


00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:43.960 align:middle line:90%
We loved Eddie-- loved him.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.470 align:middle line:90%
He was a member of our family.

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:49.570 align:middle line:84%
We were certain that
they would get married.

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:53.970 align:middle line:84%
He became extremely
abusive to her.

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:55.780 align:middle line:90%
Had never been unkind.

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: His
personality changed?

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.690 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Completely.

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:00.680 align:middle line:90%
As did my father's.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:05.020 align:middle line:84%
He got involved in
drinking heavily.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.060 align:middle line:90%
Things got out of control.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.140 align:middle line:90%
Nancy didn't even let us know.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.580 align:middle line:90%
We were 1,200 miles away.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.390 align:middle line:84%
She didn't even let us
know for a couple of months

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:17.100 align:middle line:90%
how bad things had gotten.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:22.770 align:middle line:84%
She ended the relationship
and told him he had to leave.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And she stayed in
the house alone.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Geez,
that's a brave girl.

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And not
long thereafter, Eddie

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:35.220 align:middle line:84%
went up into the woods and
he shot himself in the heart.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't do it right, and
it took a while for him to die.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.502 align:middle line:90%


00:27:42.502 --> 00:27:43.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
Bathsheba's curse.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And it devastated--
it devastated our family.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:48.900 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't her.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.256 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, but
somebody, some being--

00:27:52.256 --> 00:27:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: It was
one more person.

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:55.925 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's a chapter
called Escaping Unscathed?

00:27:55.925 --> 00:27:56.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: There was
no escaping unscathed.

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, we're
all down in Georgia.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:04.500 align:middle line:90%
And we thought that's it.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.530 align:middle line:90%
We're away from the house now.

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:09.190 align:middle line:84%
We didn't realize that
some profound attachments

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:10.700 align:middle line:90%
had been formed.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.440 align:middle line:90%
And Mrs. Warren called after.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.940 align:middle line:84%
It had been seven years
since we'd heard from her.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the house with
my mother down in the valley

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.260 align:middle line:84%
in Georgia the day
that she called.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at my mother's face
when she answered the phone.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.130 align:middle line:84%
I knew it was a
voice she recognized.

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And she said how
did you find me?

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was of course way
before the days of Google.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And I never got the answer
to that, but she found us.

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And she offered what
was a boatload of money

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:50.640 align:middle line:84%
at the time for us
to tell our story.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.630 align:middle line:84%
She wanted to connect my mother
with a ghost writer, which

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:54.390 align:middle line:90%
I find--

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:55.473 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No pun intended.

00:28:55.473 --> 00:28:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I love that phrase.

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.480 align:middle line:10%
And really, I mean
life changing,

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.670 align:middle line:10%
life altering money to write
a book and make a film.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And my mother
immediately started

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:13.010 align:middle line:84%
backing away from the phone
that she still had in her hand.

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:15.840 align:middle line:90%
And she said no, no, no.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And Lorraine said you
have to at least discuss

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:21.310 align:middle line:84%
this with your husband
and your family.

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:23.290 align:middle line:90%
And she said OK, I will.

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:24.180 align:middle line:90%
I will.

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.642 align:middle line:84%
And that night, she was attacked
in the cellar of the new house.

00:29:27.642 --> 00:29:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, goodness.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And that's a
big part of volume three.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:36.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to divulge too much
about that, because it's really

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.570 align:middle line:84%
almost the kind of thing
you need to read slowly

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:41.300 align:middle line:90%
to assimilate it.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.810 align:middle line:90%
But the answer was no.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:44.660 align:middle line:90%
Go away.

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was until you
really came around and enough

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:49.410 align:middle line:84%
had healed, enough
time had passed.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And one of the anomalies
that happened in the house--

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.690 align:middle line:84%
and because all of us have
experienced some of this

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:58.990 align:middle line:84%
to some extent, I think we
just don't know what it is.

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:02.570 align:middle line:84%
There were times when you
would have the whole contingent

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:05.780 align:middle line:84%
of them show up and your
electricity bill would almost

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:06.731 align:middle line:90%
quadruple overnight.

00:30:06.731 --> 00:30:08.230 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Oh, it
did more than that.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
were interesting.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.690 align:middle line:84%
As I was reading that,
I was thinking about it.

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:17.120 align:middle line:84%
It's an electrical universe--
the brain is electromagnetic.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.760 align:middle line:84%
The body's running on
electrical circuitriess--

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.170 align:middle line:90%
into the other dimensions.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, I
flashed back on something

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.710 align:middle line:90%
Patrick Flanagan had told me.

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:29.640 align:middle line:84%
I asked him one time--
because no one really

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.640 align:middle line:84%
explains what is electricity,
just how it works.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Patrick,
what's electricity?

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:38.210 align:middle line:90%
And he said well, that's simple.

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:42.480 align:middle line:84%
It's the flow of electrons from
a higher potential to a lower

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.690 align:middle line:90%
potential.

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered that, and I
was thinking that here you're

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:52.630 align:middle line:84%
talking about these phased
off, less dense frequencies.

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And they're pulling
on electrical forces

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:59.840 align:middle line:84%
within the third dimension to
manifest these bizarre things

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.820 align:middle line:90%
into the third dimension.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And so as you said, you were
the batteries, the girls.

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:08.950 align:middle line:90%
Everyone was drained afterward.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:13.370 align:middle line:84%
So these beings use our energy
and the available electrical

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:13.870 align:middle line:90%
forces--

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Whatever's available.

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To manifest through
an electrical mechanism

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.900 align:middle line:90%
into this dimension.

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I told you
off camera there

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.520 align:middle line:84%
was an event that I had
when I was 35 years old.

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.225 align:middle line:90%
I was already into all all this.

00:31:27.225 --> 00:31:28.100 align:middle line:90%
I meditated a little.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.671 align:middle line:84%
I was comfortable
with everything.

00:31:29.671 --> 00:31:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Laid down to take a little
nap before I went out

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:33.900 align:middle line:84%
for a dinner for
my 35th birthday.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And I start feeling as
if someone was rubbing

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:38.680 align:middle line:90%
my hand, massaging my hand.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.855 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
whoever you are, hi.

00:31:40.855 --> 00:31:42.080 align:middle line:90%
It's my birthday.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.180 align:middle line:90%
Didn't think much of it.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt a
tingling, and then I

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:46.380 align:middle line:90%
felt a tingling in my feet.

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't think
too much more of it.

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:50.240 align:middle line:84%
I thought this is
a lot of tingling.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And by the time--
I couldn't sleep.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.370 align:middle line:84%
By the time I got up
about a half hour later,

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:56.070 align:middle line:84%
I literally fell
flat on the floor.

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:58.490 align:middle line:84%
I had no energy
in my body at all.

00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:01.880 align:middle line:84%
So I talked to a respected
being about this.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And I said what
happened on my birthday?

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And they said, did
you try to stop it?

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.510 align:middle line:90%
And I said no.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:11.570 align:middle line:90%
I was just curious.

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:14.580 align:middle line:84%
They said then was
there any wrong done?

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:18.070 align:middle line:84%
He said this happens with people
all the time out of curiosity,

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:20.550 align:middle line:84%
non-observance,
ignorance, or whatever.

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.620 align:middle line:90%
In your case, you just let 'em.

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:26.350 align:middle line:84%
He said we're all
bathed in a sea of this,

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:29.230 align:middle line:84%
and beings are surrounding
us all the time.

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And if you have high
wattage, like you

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:34.330 align:middle line:84%
do, like members of your
family did, like I do,

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:35.440 align:middle line:90%
beings like that.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Because they're just
observing and feeding off

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.120 align:middle line:90%
of it if you give it to them.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Right.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And on some level,
without permission, your family

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:47.650 align:middle line:84%
was giving them massive amounts
of their electrical field.

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:50.701 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: We were,
unbeknownst to us.

00:32:50.701 --> 00:32:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's why
everyone collapsed at the end

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:55.520 align:middle line:84%
these events and would
have to sleep for 24,

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.950 align:middle line:90%
46 hours or whatever, 36 hours.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: We'd be outside
having a game of softball.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Everybody was just so
high energy and so happy

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.920 align:middle line:90%
as a family.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:08.080 align:middle line:84%
Or we'd be out sledding
down the power lines.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And everyone, my father
included, happy, light love.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And we'd walked into the house
and it was like being slammed.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Your batteries
were literally drained.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Talk about this for
the rest of humanity.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:22.510 align:middle line:90%
You walk in certain places.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:24.642 align:middle line:84%
There are positive and
negative little vortexes

00:33:24.642 --> 00:33:25.600 align:middle line:90%
of all over the planet.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.070 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: All over.

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:28.069 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Foot by foot,
you can go to a positive

00:33:28.069 --> 00:33:30.540 align:middle line:84%
into a negative zone where
you're totally drained.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:33.840 align:middle line:84%
What can you share
with us about that

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:37.290 align:middle line:84%
when we're experiencing this
sudden drain in our energy

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:39.202 align:middle line:90%
field, all of us?

00:33:39.202 --> 00:33:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Generally,
the best thing

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:43.410 align:middle line:84%
to do if you're in a situation
like that where you feel

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:48.570 align:middle line:84%
like you're being tapped
into is to simply--

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:50.390 align:middle line:84%
and you don't even
have to verbalize it.

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:53.740 align:middle line:84%
You can just simply say
no, this is my energy.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm not willing to share this.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.100 align:middle line:90%
Seek it elsewhere.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And generally, whatever it is
that's tapping in will-- not

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.680 align:middle line:90%
always.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not always.

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:04.940 align:middle line:90%
There are some abusive types.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:06.180 align:middle line:90%
But also even land.

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:07.810 align:middle line:84%
There are masses
of land you go to,

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and you described your
farmhouse as a portal

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:15.520 align:middle line:84%
of sorts that really allowed one
to move beyond time and space.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Past, present, and future
were one, all of these events,

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:20.550 align:middle line:84%
as you explained it
in that stunning story

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:23.050 align:middle line:84%
at the end of our
second conversation.

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:26.560 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it's just an
alertness in our in mind

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.005 align:middle line:90%
to start tapping in?

00:34:28.005 --> 00:34:30.310 align:middle line:90%
Ah, I felt good over there.

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Why don't I feel
good right here?

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.489 align:middle line:90%
And then just move on.

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:34.810 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Exactly.

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And with awareness comes
enlightenment-- with awareness.

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And I write in the books that
the spirits are the source

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:48.250 align:middle line:90%
of our enlightenment.

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:54.270 align:middle line:84%
What is extra dimensional to us,
which is actually all the same.

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:57.560 align:middle line:84%
I believe that all
of the dimensions--

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.490 align:middle line:84%
that we live in a
multi-dimensional universe,

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:00.950 align:middle line:90%
that everything is correlated.

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:02.910 align:middle line:90%
It's integrated.

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:06.160 align:middle line:84%
If everything is one
thing, then there

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:11.670 align:middle line:84%
is some correlation between
extraterrestrial and spiritual

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:12.900 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:18.214 align:middle line:84%
I have yet to come to grips
with exactly what that is.

00:35:18.214 --> 00:35:19.880 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm working
toward, but I'll

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:23.940 align:middle line:84%
tell you an answer to your
question that you posed first.

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:28.380 align:middle line:84%
My mother says I traverse
the stream of consciousness,

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:30.030 align:middle line:90%
but I only have one oar.

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And therefore I come full
circle at some point,

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:35.140 align:middle line:90%
and this is the full circle.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:38.580 align:middle line:84%
It took 30 years
to tell our story.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.100 align:middle line:84%
I always knew I would
be the one to do it.

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Everybody in my family knew
I would be the one to do it.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.550 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a series
of scary stories.

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:48.310 align:middle line:90%
This is a spiritual journey.

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:49.127 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:49.127 --> 00:35:50.960 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: When you're
done with these books,

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.220 align:middle line:84%
you feel like you
lived there with us.

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:55.860 align:middle line:84%
It changes the way you think
and feel about everything.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:58.840 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm the only
author on the planet that

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.782 align:middle line:84%
goes around and warns
people off of my books.

00:36:01.782 --> 00:36:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, you don't
want to take it on lightly.

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:05.902 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: No, I want
them to be prepared.

00:36:05.902 --> 00:36:07.610 align:middle line:84%
If they're not prepared--
because they're

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:09.920 align:middle line:84%
going to get way more
than they expect.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And if they're not
prepared, I want

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:15.900 align:middle line:84%
them to wait until they
are in the same way

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:18.780 align:middle line:84%
that I waited to
write these books.

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.150 align:middle line:84%
For 30 years, I did all
kinds of other things.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:23.570 align:middle line:84%
I was a therapeutic
counselor for a decade.

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Worked with children,
developmentally disabled

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:29.800 align:middle line:84%
adults, behaviorally
disordered children.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:30.870 align:middle line:90%
I had a restaurant.

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.620 align:middle line:90%
I had a jewelry business.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:34.220 align:middle line:90%
I wore so many different hats.

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:38.940 align:middle line:84%
I learned, and learned,
and learned, and blocked.

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:40.750 align:middle line:84%
There was so much
happening to me.

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:45.230 align:middle line:84%
I was so integrated with spirit
that it was just natural.

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:47.170 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't supernatural.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:51.000 align:middle line:84%
No, I tell folks we moved into
that house as a normal family,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.290 align:middle line:84%
and we left 10 years later as
a supremely paranormal family.

00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:58.950 align:middle line:84%
Even my father has regular
incidents, regular,

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:01.534 align:middle line:84%
and especially extraterrestrial
stuff going on with my dad.

00:37:01.534 --> 00:37:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Now he does?

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:02.950 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Mhm.

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The one
who tried to run?

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:08.750 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, they're
getting him back for me.

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:12.650 align:middle line:84%
I love him dearly, but
he still makes me crazy.

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:14.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So now he
has constant visitors.

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:15.879 align:middle line:90%
He's not left alone.

00:37:15.879 --> 00:37:17.670 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And you know
Florida's a hot bed.

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And he's in Winter
Garden, Florida.

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:21.810 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very active area.

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:26.180 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I think he's the
point of attraction, actually.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:30.510 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is that the
world had to be ready for this.

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:32.660 align:middle line:84%
The world had to
get ready for this.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:35.420 align:middle line:90%
It had to mature spiritually.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that I really
want to address with people

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:44.150 align:middle line:84%
is that we are in the
midst of a paradigm shift.

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:46.120 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that's coming.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:47.640 align:middle line:90%
It's something that is.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yes, and we have
to be able to acknowledge

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:51.750 align:middle line:90%
this in all facets.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Because one thing, we've
always had a fascination

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:55.180 align:middle line:90%
with fright stories.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Human beings are addicted to
a certain amount of gross.

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:58.445 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yeah, the adrenaline.

00:37:58.445 --> 00:37:59.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Intense emotions
and the adrenaline.

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not as though
people wouldn't go see something

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:03.890 align:middle line:90%
like "The Conjuring" easily.

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:05.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, especially
when we're young.

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Teenagers in particular
love this kind of stuff.

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:12.520 align:middle line:84%
But you're bringing this to our
attention on a holistic level,

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.160 align:middle line:84%
as spiritual beings and
looking at the complexity

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.340 align:middle line:84%
because the reality is most
of the beings in that house

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:18.919 align:middle line:90%
were benign.

00:38:18.919 --> 00:38:19.960 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes, they were.

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Even friendly.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:21.460 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes, benevolent.

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: April had a
little-- benevolent.

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.810 align:middle line:84%
April had a little friend,
whoever turned your pages when

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:27.280 align:middle line:90%
you were playing the piano.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:31.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a part of
the reality that has not

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:34.550 align:middle line:84%
been focused as much on,
certainly in the depictions

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:36.130 align:middle line:90%
in "The Conjuring" and such.

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:39.110 align:middle line:84%
But it's showing us
this rich tapestry

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:41.690 align:middle line:84%
of unseen energies
around us all the time.

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And that includes the potential,
like in our world, for abuse.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:50.680 align:middle line:90%
Abuse, yeah.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And I do want you get to what
you just started, by the way,

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.200 align:middle line:84%
about the messages
of the future.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Because through these
years of contact,

00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.820 align:middle line:84%
you've been shown
things again and again,

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:01.500 align:middle line:84%
and they're very
consistent with what

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.500 align:middle line:84%
had been shown to other
people I've interviewed.

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I have, and some
of it's a little frightening.

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:09.240 align:middle line:90%
And I will say that.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.959 align:middle line:84%
Well, Paul Hellyer's another one
who has divulged a great deal,

00:39:12.959 --> 00:39:15.000 align:middle line:84%
but there are some things
he's still withholding.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Please,
explain for people

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.240 align:middle line:90%
who don't know who Paul is.

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.357 align:middle line:90%
Explain who Paul is.

00:39:18.357 --> 00:39:20.190 align:middle line:10%
>>PERRON: Paul Hellyer
is the former Defense

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:24.360 align:middle line:10%
Minister of Canada, the right
and honorable Paul Hellyer.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:30.330 align:middle line:10%
There could be no better
title for this fine man.

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And at 89 years old,
he decided that it

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:35.090 align:middle line:90%
was time to tell the truth.

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He's writing a
book right now about it.

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:37.476 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: He is.

00:39:37.476 --> 00:39:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And I told him as soon
as it's published,

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:43.830 align:middle line:84%
it's going smack dab in
the middle of my website.

00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I want it out all
over the world.

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:49.780 align:middle line:84%
He is an extraordinary
human being.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A very brave man.

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:55.820 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Very brave, very kind,
deeply intellectual but also

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:58.440 align:middle line:90%
deeply emotional.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And he has been touched
in a way by this.

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And keep in mind that
this was not directly.

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:08.410 align:middle line:84%
Until last year, he never
had an encounter with an ET.

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:09.380 align:middle line:90%
This was all cerebral.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: He knew about it
from a military point of view,

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:12.365 align:middle line:90%
but he had not yet personally--

00:40:12.365 --> 00:40:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: He had not personally
had an encounter, and yet

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:23.500 align:middle line:84%
because of his deep intellect
and his regard for those

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:29.170 align:middle line:84%
who had disclosed, he has
decided to share what he knows.

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And he won't share
all of it because he

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:34.070 align:middle line:84%
feels that the world is
not prepared for all of it.

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:36.120 align:middle line:90%
And I must agree with him.

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.970 align:middle line:90%
But I'll tell you another thing.

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:41.500 align:middle line:84%
I've been one that for
several years now--

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, since I disclosed,
has been a little militant

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:48.190 align:middle line:90%
in my approach.

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:51.242 align:middle line:84%
I demand disclosure from
the federal government.

00:40:51.242 --> 00:40:52.450 align:middle line:90%
Like they're listening to me.

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, turns out they
are listening to me,

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:57.600 align:middle line:90%
and I'm glad for that.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel a
threat about that.

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:04.050 align:middle line:84%
What I realized is that we
are the point of disclosure--

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:07.130 align:middle line:90%
Paul, you, me, Paula Harris.

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:10.830 align:middle line:84%
You know so many that have
had these experiences,

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:16.336 align:middle line:84%
we are the point of disclosure
because the government can't.

00:41:16.336 --> 00:41:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not really.

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:19.043 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: The government
can't, because they

00:41:19.043 --> 00:41:25.010 align:middle line:84%
know so much that it would
be too much for people.

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:27.880 align:middle line:84%
Part of me says you don't
give us nearly enough credit

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.820 align:middle line:90%
for our own intelligence.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.759 align:middle line:84%
And I get a little angry
about that sometimes.

00:41:31.759 --> 00:41:32.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I do too.

00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: But there
are many, many people

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:40.060 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, the mere
mortals that are not like us,

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:42.190 align:middle line:90%
that it will blow minds.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm afraid that it's
going to fracture belief

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:46.560 align:middle line:90%
systems around the world.

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm really afraid
of is that unnecessarily so,

00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:53.340 align:middle line:84%
this planet will
face mass suicide.

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have
to be that way.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.903 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about what you've

00:41:56.903 --> 00:41:58.850 align:middle line:84%
been shown, what
you have been told,

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:04.100 align:middle line:84%
and also what the
anecdote to it is.

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.430 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I don't think
that there is an antidote.

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:09.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't because I don't think
that what we're being fed

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:10.590 align:middle line:90%
is poison.

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:12.650 align:middle line:84%
I think that what we're
being fed is the truth,

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and there shouldn't
be an antidote.

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:16.770 align:middle line:84%
The truth is the
truth is the truth.

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:19.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, an antidote to the
large picture-- our behavior,

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:21.780 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is we need
to embrace that we

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.400 align:middle line:90%
might be bucking right now.

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking more of what
is the antidote to that

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:27.785 align:middle line:90%
that has been shown.

00:42:27.785 --> 00:42:29.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk about
what's been shown

00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:33.430 align:middle line:84%
and then what the best
action reaction is.

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: What I have
seen is that we women have

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:40.110 align:middle line:84%
to take over the
world geopolitically,

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:44.580 align:middle line:84%
not exopolitically-- There are
other powers at work here--

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:46.230 align:middle line:90%
but geopolitically.

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:52.410 align:middle line:84%
Women must assume power,
leadership roles in the world.

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:54.994 align:middle line:84%
And I don't say that as the
radical feminist that I am.

00:42:54.994 --> 00:42:56.577 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: No, I've
heard this and seen

00:42:56.577 --> 00:42:58.170 align:middle line:90%
this come up in many places.

00:42:58.170 --> 00:42:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes.

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.310 align:middle line:84%
I had a vision--
it was not a dream.

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:03.780 align:middle line:84%
It was a vision--
about a month ago

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:05.740 align:middle line:90%
that was very, very powerful.

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:08.680 align:middle line:84%
I spoke to you about my
paranormal partner George

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:09.660 align:middle line:90%
Lopez.

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:11.410 align:middle line:84%
He was somehow
involved with this.

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:14.940 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how or why.

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:18.460 align:middle line:90%
But I was sitting.

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.640 align:middle line:90%
I laid down on the sofa.

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:25.110 align:middle line:84%
I had worked for many hours that
day, but I didn't fall asleep.

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Instead, I went into
an altered state

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:31.480 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly I was right
back in my chair at the desk.

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And my mom was in the kitchen
brewing a pot of coffee.

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:38.690 align:middle line:90%
The door opened to our parlor.

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
man that walked in.

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:43.340 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you every line on
his face, the color of his eyes,

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:45.010 align:middle line:90%
his hair, how he smelled.

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:47.070 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he was right there.

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And a woman walked in behind
him, kind of Peggy Lipton hair,

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.340 align:middle line:90%
you know, from the Mod Squad?

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Everything about her,
I recognized her,

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:57.512 align:middle line:90%
I recognized him.

00:43:57.512 --> 00:43:58.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how.

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:01.150 align:middle line:84%
I never met either one
of them in this realm.

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:02.830 align:middle line:90%
He came over to me at the desk.

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:04.500 align:middle line:84%
I turned around
in my desk chair.

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:07.010 align:middle line:90%
I said, why are you here?

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:09.900 align:middle line:84%
She went into the kitchen,
turned my mother around,

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:11.570 align:middle line:84%
who had come,
heard a disruption,

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:13.040 align:middle line:90%
came into the parlor.

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:16.300 align:middle line:84%
She turned my mother around and
took her back into the kitchen.

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:20.030 align:middle line:84%
He lifted me up out of the chair
by my shoulders very gently.

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And he said, come
with me, Miss Perron.

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:23.840 align:middle line:90%
I said, all right.

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going?

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.590 align:middle line:90%
He took me out the door.

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:32.710 align:middle line:84%
In the interim, some very, very
heavy construction equipment

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:34.800 align:middle line:84%
had pulled onto our
property, onto the grounds

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.200 align:middle line:90%
of our property.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:39.970 align:middle line:84%
They were enclosing the
carport into a room.

00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:43.140 align:middle line:84%
They were building on another
room to the front of the house.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:45.790 align:middle line:84%
They were building on to
the back of the house.

00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:50.480 align:middle line:84%
I said, why are you here
and why is this happening?

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:51.910 align:middle line:90%
And I was firm.

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:53.220 align:middle line:90%
They were being kind to me.

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:55.770 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't being unkind
to them, but I needed

00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:57.620 align:middle line:90%
to know what was happening.

00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And my concern was what was
going to happened to my mother.

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:02.530 align:middle line:90%
And Christine was away at work.

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:05.340 align:middle line:84%
And I said what about
my sister Christine?

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:07.290 align:middle line:84%
He said she will not
be coming back here,

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:09.750 align:middle line:84%
but she's being well
cared for and she's fine.

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Your mother will
be well cared for.

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:13.010 align:middle line:90%
I said what about the dogs?

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:15.660 align:middle line:84%
My mother can't take care of
all these animals herself.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:16.580 align:middle line:90%
She needs help.

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:18.960 align:middle line:84%
He said someone will be
here to take care of her.

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:22.260 align:middle line:90%


00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:27.160 align:middle line:84%
They moved me from the
now enclosed carport.

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I could hear
all this equipment around.

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:32.170 align:middle line:90%
We only have a couple of acres.

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:34.050 align:middle line:84%
It's not a huge
piece of property.

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:36.270 align:middle line:84%
But I could hear
all this equipment

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:38.060 align:middle line:90%
going on outside the house.

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:40.570 align:middle line:90%
And a woman came up behind me.

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And she led me into another
room into a darker spot.

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:46.335 align:middle line:90%
She was dressed in a lab coat.

00:45:46.335 --> 00:45:49.120 align:middle line:90%


00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:54.036 align:middle line:84%
She had gloves on, plastic
gloves-- rubber gloves.

00:45:54.036 --> 00:45:56.640 align:middle line:84%
She asked me if I would
please turn a certain way

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.720 align:middle line:90%
and stand facing the wall.

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And before I knew it, her hands
had come up underneath my shirt

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:07.300 align:middle line:84%
and her fingers were feeling
around in the pit of my arms.

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And then she gave me a
thorough breast exam.

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And then she undid my jeans
and checked the lymph nodes

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:17.924 align:middle line:90%
in my crotch area.

00:46:17.924 --> 00:46:18.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Groin, yeah?

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yeah.

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.390 align:middle line:90%
I knew she was a doctor.

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:24.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how.

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what
are you looking for?

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And she said we're
here to protect you.

00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but I need to
know why are you doing this?

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:36.490 align:middle line:90%
Your hands are all over my body.

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:37.530 align:middle line:90%
Why are you doing this?

00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And I went to turn my
head to talk to her

00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:42.820 align:middle line:84%
and make direct eye
contact with her.

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And I saw something coming at
me that looked like an EpiPen.

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And I felt it inject
into the side of my neck.

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.640 align:middle line:84%
When I woke up from
that, I was now

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:55.280 align:middle line:84%
in a room that had been built
on to the back of the farmhouse.

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:58.140 align:middle line:84%
There was no entrance
into the farmhouse.

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.140 align:middle line:90%
I was laying on a sofa.

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:01.720 align:middle line:90%
My computer had been moved.

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.490 align:middle line:84%
My desk had been
moved out there.

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:06.970 align:middle line:84%
My personal belongings
had been moved out there.

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:08.700 align:middle line:84%
I was looking
around the property,

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:12.160 align:middle line:84%
and there was a 20
foot high earthen wall

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:15.180 align:middle line:84%
that had been built all
around compound style

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:17.090 align:middle line:90%
around our property.

00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And I looked down and there was
a piece of electronic equipment

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:24.430 align:middle line:84%
that looked like an old
fashioned cellphone.

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:25.910 align:middle line:90%
You remember how big they were?

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:27.300 align:middle line:90%
Only it was very thin.

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:28.910 align:middle line:90%
And it had a screen.

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:30.660 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen anything
like this before.

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:35.680 align:middle line:84%
It had an HDTV screen in
it as well as a phone.

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And I picked it up,
and I saw world panic.

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.590 align:middle line:90%
I saw chaos.

00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:42.426 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at it,
and I'm staring at it,

00:47:42.426 --> 00:47:43.217 align:middle line:90%
and I'm holding it.

00:47:43.217 --> 00:47:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I start
dialing George's number.

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Over, and over, and over, it
won't let me talk to George.

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:50.640 align:middle line:90%
It won't let me reach George.

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And I took it, and I
heaved it across the room.

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And I came out of this
saying, I told you, George.

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:00.030 align:middle line:90%
I told you.

00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:00.820 align:middle line:90%
I told you.

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:02.510 align:middle line:90%
I told you, George.

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:05.472 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it ended.

00:48:05.472 --> 00:48:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
what that message is,

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.340 align:middle line:90%
but we don't have long.

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:12.240 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.072 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
that to panic people.

00:48:14.072 --> 00:48:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, no.

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:15.260 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I'm not.

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:17.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't want people
to be afraid.

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:19.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't want them to be afraid.

00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:22.410 align:middle line:90%
I want them to wake up.

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:26.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So having in
my position, not just

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:29.010 align:middle line:84%
interviewees, but I do a lot
of research behind the scenes

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:29.610 align:middle line:90%
and I have a lot of contacts.

00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: I know you do.

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You know that.

00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot
of people who are

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:36.240 align:middle line:84%
well respected in the world
of intuition, and channeling,

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.010 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And so I asked them
what do you see?

00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:40.840 align:middle line:90%
What do you see for the future?

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And it there seems to be
this consensus of sorts

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:47.700 align:middle line:84%
though it's never very
directly spoken about.

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:50.430 align:middle line:84%
The stage you talked about is
what's never directly spoken

00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:55.070 align:middle line:84%
about, that we're
coming up to a time

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:56.950 align:middle line:84%
where there's going
to be a great shift.

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And many suppose that might
start with a huge shift

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:01.760 align:middle line:90%
in the economies of the world.

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:03.680 align:middle line:84%
That would create
panic, obviously.

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:04.680 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: It's underway.

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:09.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's underway, and
that it will become more severe

00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:11.700 align:middle line:84%
because an old system must
crumble before a new one can

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:12.990 align:middle line:90%
be given birth to.

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:15.660 align:middle line:84%
But again, it always
goes to the same point.

00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:17.820 align:middle line:90%
There will be some rough spots.

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:20.032 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's as much
as anyone chooses

00:49:20.032 --> 00:49:22.490 align:middle line:84%
to reflect because it's not
something all that controllable

00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:23.910 align:middle line:90%
from our point of view.

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:26.530 align:middle line:84%
But then after
that is when we see

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:32.180 align:middle line:84%
a new type of experience for
humanity to be given birth to.

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And no one knows the
timelines exactly.

00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, you got the timeline
that was something like what?

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: We have
about five years left.

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Five years before
the panicky part, before we

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.260 align:middle line:90%
should start seeing some chaos.

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:47.780 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just saying from
many other points of view,

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:49.110 align:middle line:90%
this is consistent.

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:51.720 align:middle line:84%
This is a consistent
story, but no one ever

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.094 align:middle line:90%
goes into details of it.

00:49:53.094 --> 00:49:54.010 align:middle line:90%
And there's no reason.

00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:56.070 align:middle line:90%
Why perpetuate that?

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:59.090 align:middle line:84%
We need to focus on what
has true value, which

00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:05.620 align:middle line:84%
is people, family, sharing,
love, healthy food that we can

00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:07.070 align:middle line:84%
sustain and grow
on our own-- all

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:10.050 align:middle line:84%
these very basic common
things are the things

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:11.680 align:middle line:84%
we can very well
do for ourselves

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:15.930 align:middle line:84%
and maybe not have such a
horrendous crossover period.

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:17.110 align:middle line:90%
Tell me your thoughts on it?

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I think that there
are those, yourself among us,

00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:24.570 align:middle line:84%
that are already
going through it.

00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Many people who
are already going

00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:29.010 align:middle line:84%
through this shift,
this transition,

00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:31.390 align:middle line:84%
there are physical
symptoms that go along

00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:34.322 align:middle line:84%
with this-- sudden,
inexplicable headaches,

00:50:34.322 --> 00:50:36.530 align:middle line:84%
a feeling of the Earth
shifting underneath your feet.

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:38.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, a lot of
strange, anomalous [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Very strange,
anomalous light.

00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:47.070 align:middle line:84%
I see sparkles coming
through my computer screen.

00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:48.470 align:middle line:90%
Nothing wrong with my Mac.

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:49.954 align:middle line:90%
It's perfectly fine.

00:50:49.954 --> 00:50:51.620 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't happen to
anybody else that's

00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:54.090 align:middle line:90%
on the computer, just me.

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:57.590 align:middle line:84%
I have some incredible--
and it's not just me.

00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:01.340 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the ascension--
incredible joint pain.

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:04.050 align:middle line:84%
We are changing at
a subatomic level.

00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: This is
a molecular shift,

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:12.970 align:middle line:84%
and it's happening with what
some people call the guides.

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:16.340 align:middle line:84%
We are the ones that have
to go through this now

00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:18.910 align:middle line:84%
to help others go
through it later.

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:22.340 align:middle line:84%
My job George said to
me the day I told him

00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:26.090 align:middle line:84%
that the third book
had been published,

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:28.340 align:middle line:90%
he said, honey, it's just begun.

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:29.640 align:middle line:90%
This isn't the end.

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:31.470 align:middle line:90%
It's only the beginning.

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:33.820 align:middle line:90%
And you've put your story out.

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:35.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm so proud of you.

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.160 align:middle line:84%
You've put it all out
there, but this really

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:38.550 align:middle line:90%
is just the beginning.

00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:40.300 align:middle line:90%
Your job is much bigger.

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And I perceive my job to be
helping others dispel the fear.

00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Because it is the fear that
will be the undoing of mankind.

00:51:49.590 --> 00:51:50.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And again, as
individuals, we have

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:54.300 align:middle line:84%
to take some self
responsibility.

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:54.740 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: That's right.

00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:56.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We have chosen
to incarnate at this time.

00:51:56.970 --> 00:51:59.930 align:middle line:84%
We have chosen to go through
this experience together.

00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So we're all in it
together, literally.

00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: And we're gathering.

00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:04.445 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's not about
competition anymore.

00:52:04.445 --> 00:52:06.926 align:middle line:84%
It's about the
gathering of souls.

00:52:06.926 --> 00:52:08.050 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Of the clan, yes.

00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: To usher
in what literally

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:15.010 align:middle line:84%
will be a more, let's say,
maybe a little more gracious age

00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:16.596 align:middle line:84%
that's not so rife
with competition.

00:52:16.596 --> 00:52:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean--
I'm not trying

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:20.490 align:middle line:84%
to make it sound
like a utopia, but I

00:52:20.490 --> 00:52:24.700 align:middle line:84%
think we're heading toward
kinder more cohesive times

00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:27.850 align:middle line:84%
on governmental levels,
on economic levels,

00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:30.610 align:middle line:84%
on definitely connection
and spiritual levels.

00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:35.070 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: Yes, I find that
we've been coming together.

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, I told you earlier,
when I met you, I knew you.

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.430 align:middle line:90%
I knew you instantly.

00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:40.760 align:middle line:90%
I've known you forever.

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:41.990 align:middle line:90%
I've known Paula forever.

00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:43.610 align:middle line:90%
I've known George forever.

00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:47.530 align:middle line:84%
I've had dozens and dozens
of people come into my life,

00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:50.610 align:middle line:84%
into my world, in
the last few years

00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:52.550 align:middle line:84%
that I feel quite
certain I have known

00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:53.654 align:middle line:90%
for at least a millennium.

00:52:53.654 --> 00:52:56.160 align:middle line:90%


00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.970 align:middle line:84%
It is what I call
birds of a feather

00:52:57.970 --> 00:52:59.930 align:middle line:90%
do tend to flock together.

00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:02.200 align:middle line:84%
We are the gathering
and many are here.

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that we
have chosen to come back,

00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:09.430 align:middle line:84%
or we were assigned
to come back.

00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Based on how odd I
feel about being here,

00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:14.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I
necessarily chose.

00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:18.050 align:middle line:84%
I think that this might
be my penance in some way.

00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:23.090 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that I had
something very important.

00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:25.660 align:middle line:84%
I felt special from
a very early age.

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:30.760 align:middle line:84%
And because I was
always taught your ego,

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:31.890 align:middle line:90%
check that at the door.

00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:35.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my mother is
a very humble soul

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and she taught all of her
girls to be the same way.

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:41.910 align:middle line:90%
But I knew it.

00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:43.740 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't know
what it meant,

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know what
the outcome will be.

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:49.050 align:middle line:84%
But I do feel
divinely protected.

00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:51.510 align:middle line:90%
I feel divinely inspired.

00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:54.800 align:middle line:84%
I think that each one of us
is a living manifestation

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.490 align:middle line:90%
of God consciousness.

00:53:56.490 --> 00:54:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And our eyes are the way that
God sees the world, this world.

00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:04.800 align:middle line:84%
But I also know that I've
been to other worlds.

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:05.510 align:middle line:90%
I have.

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I can
fly, and I can float,

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and I have gone off
planet many times.

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.990 align:middle line:84%
I recall some places
that I've been

00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:17.490 align:middle line:84%
to that are so
beautiful, so beautiful,

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:19.297 align:middle line:84%
literally cruising
into the atmosphere.

00:54:19.297 --> 00:54:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
a beautiful story

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:23.280 align:middle line:84%
because in reality, as
souls each one of us,

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:24.531 align:middle line:90%
we're not trapped in anything.

00:54:24.531 --> 00:54:25.863 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: No, we're not trapped.

00:54:25.863 --> 00:54:27.259 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The soul has choices.

00:54:27.259 --> 00:54:28.300 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: This is an urn.

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:29.174 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:54:29.174 --> 00:54:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's an
urn, and this is

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:35.470 align:middle line:84%
one reality that we can play
out in and learn in, express in.

00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:37.047 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean
it can't be one

00:54:37.047 --> 00:54:38.380 align:middle line:90%
of these other beautiful realms.

00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: That's right.

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No one's a prisoner.

00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:42.158 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And they could be
happening simultaneously.

00:54:42.158 --> 00:54:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We behave like
prisoners, but we're not.

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: I didn't mean to
step all over you, but yes.

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:46.486 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's true.

00:54:46.486 --> 00:54:47.780 align:middle line:90%
And they're all simultaneous.

00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:49.110 align:middle line:84%
>>PERRON: And do you
feel the light come?

00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:50.234 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel the brightness?

00:54:50.234 --> 00:54:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Because we're tapping into
something that is truth.

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:57.220 align:middle line:84%
We're tapping into--
there is so much more.

00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Very soon, we are
all going to be

00:54:59.930 --> 00:55:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Dorothy stepping out of black
and white into Technicolor.

00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:05.820 align:middle line:90%
Here it comes.

00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:07.010 align:middle line:90%
Be prepared.

00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:08.257 align:middle line:90%
Be the light you see.

00:55:08.257 --> 00:55:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And don't
freak out about the fact

00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:12.540 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to go through
a little chaos down the road

00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:12.700 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Be not afraid.

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Be not afraid.

00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:15.282 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Be not afraid.

00:55:15.282 --> 00:55:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I have just
one final question.

00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Did this bring all of
you, your entire family,

00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:23.740 align:middle line:84%
into a sense of closeness
that could never be

00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:26.640 align:middle line:90%
understood by the rest of us?

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.800 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes, it did.

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And even though we fight
like cats and dogs sometimes,

00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:35.180 align:middle line:84%
we'd defend each
other with our lives.

00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:38.090 align:middle line:90%
I adore my family.

00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:40.070 align:middle line:90%
And they likewise adore me.

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:43.390 align:middle line:84%
We are very, very
distinct individuals.

00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:46.450 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing like about us.

00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:48.470 align:middle line:84%
The closest connection,
I would say,

00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:51.640 align:middle line:84%
would be between my
mother and myself.

00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:55.160 align:middle line:90%
But this was very cathartic.

00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:57.590 align:middle line:84%
It was extremely painful
to tell this story.

00:55:57.590 --> 00:55:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are they OK
with your doing this?

00:55:58.550 --> 00:55:59.258 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Oh yes.

00:55:59.258 --> 00:56:00.840 align:middle line:90%
They helped me tremendously.

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Christine was the one
that was most traumatized.

00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:06.490 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even realize that
until I was writing the books.

00:56:06.490 --> 00:56:09.820 align:middle line:84%
I lived with this woman,
and it took me three years

00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:11.530 align:middle line:90%
to get her stories from her.

00:56:11.530 --> 00:56:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Everything else
that was in the book

00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:16.820 align:middle line:84%
about her was secondhand
from Cindy, or Nancy,

00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:19.070 align:middle line:84%
or what I witnessed,
or whatever.

00:56:19.070 --> 00:56:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Finally, she broke down,
and she spilled it.

00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:24.841 align:middle line:84%
And then she said
that's it-- no more.

00:56:24.841 --> 00:56:25.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No more.

00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And do you feel that all
of you are collectively

00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.490 align:middle line:90%
healing from this?

00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:30.140 align:middle line:90%
And beyond?

00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:31.235 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you understand--

00:56:31.235 --> 00:56:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Yes, I do.

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:33.220 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's a blessed,
wonderful thing.

00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:37.490 align:middle line:10%
See, what we had to
come to terms with

00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:40.487 align:middle line:10%
was that this was a blessing.

00:56:40.487 --> 00:56:41.070 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:56:41.070 --> 00:56:44.030 align:middle line:10%
>>PERRON: If it was a curse,
it was likewise a blessing.

00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:46.610 align:middle line:10%
And that's why my mother
titled the books "House

00:56:46.610 --> 00:56:48.700 align:middle line:10%
of Darkness, House of Light."

00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:50.970 align:middle line:90%
It was both.

00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:54.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Andrea, I mean, this
has been an incredible three

00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:55.800 align:middle line:90%
hours with you.

00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:57.610 align:middle line:90%
And this won't be edited.

00:56:57.610 --> 00:56:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you
so much, and your family,

00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:01.780 align:middle line:84%
and your mother, your
sisters, and everyone

00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:03.880 align:middle line:84%
for having the courage
to share this story

00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:06.470 align:middle line:84%
and show us the
depth of possibility

00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:09.160 align:middle line:84%
even in what looks
like the darkest stuff.

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:09.660 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: There is light.

00:57:10.570 --> 00:57:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There is
light, absolutely.

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.430 align:middle line:84%
At the end, at the
bottom, always light.

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>>PERRON: Always.

00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:18.990 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, for the full
details of these experiences,

00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:20.760 align:middle line:10%
you can find all three
volumes of "House

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:23.070 align:middle line:10%
of Darkness, House of
Light" on amazon.com

00:57:23.070 --> 00:57:24.910 align:middle line:10%
and other major booksellers.

00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Also if you were
intrigued with this topic,

interview with Anne Andrews

00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:31.220 align:middle line:84%
and what her family
went through.

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
